00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
One Nation another God indivisible with
 
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
one of our final meetings maybe not our
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
our absolute final meeting for the
 
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
session but uh the session here but
 
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
certainly one of our last meetings we
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a presentation this morning by the
 
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
policy research shop at Dartmouth
 
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
College looking forward to that before
 
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
we get to that though
 
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to talk to the committee about
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
a couple of other things
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
number one we're going to have three
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
bills returned from three house bills
 
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
returned from the Senate with amendments
 
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
those three bills are House Bill 233
 
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
which is a thermal wreck bill
 
00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
House Bill 281 which was the repeal of
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
the least cost integrated resource plan
 
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
statute and House Bill 139 which
 
00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
originally was a municipal group
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
host net metering bill
 
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
all three of those bills were amended by
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
the Senate and all three of those bills
 
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going to encourage that the
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee concur with the Senate
 
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.270 align:start position:0%
committee concur with the Senate
amendments

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the first of those bills HB 233
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
all the Senate did was change a couple
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
of words
 
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
uh to clarify that the department of
 
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
energy needs to approve new
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
methodologies for
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
determining determining the validity of
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
requests

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
requests
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's a simple change a logical change
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
I think we should just concur the other
 
00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
two bills are more complicated HB 281
 
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
which was the
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
repeal of least cost integrated resource
 
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
planning the Senate made significant
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
changes to that bill they added four
 
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
other bills
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
three other house bills and a portion of
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
another house bill to that bill so it's
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
a mini Omnibus Bill now and it includes
 
00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
the municipal group net metering host
 
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
group net metering change that was made
 
00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:39.539 align:start position:0%
by hb139 removing Municipal boundaries
 
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
it also adds about eight pages of House
 
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
Bill 609 which was the reform of the
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee House Bill 609
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
as you will recall
 
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.070 align:start position:0%
as you will recall
changed

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
the house the site evaluation committee
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
from being a standalone committee to
 
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
being part of the Public Utilities
 
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.530 align:start position:0%
being part of the Public Utilities
Commission

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
well what the Senate did is they looked
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
at that bill and they extracted what
 
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
they thought were the most important
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
components of the bill without going all
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
the way to the
 
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
transfer of the responsibilities to the
 
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.829 align:start position:0%
transfer of the responsibilities to the
POC

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:22.019 align:start position:0%
and they Incorporated those Eight Pages
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
of reforms of the existing site
 
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee into house bill
 
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.530 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee into house bill
281.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
in addition to that they added the text
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 251 which was a bill that
 
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
filed to
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
require that the December electric bill
 
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
show a dollar figure for compliance for
 
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
an individual person's compliance with
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard
 
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.509 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard
and

00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:59.930 --> 00:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
then the final piece was they added the
 
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
substance of House Bill 622 a bill we
 
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.430 align:start position:0%
substance of House Bill 622 a bill we
retained

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
which repeals the easy board so those
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
are the five changes they made to HB 281
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
and I recommend that we concur with that
 
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
and I recommend that we concur with that
bill

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
and before we go on to the last bill
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize Randy Thomas for a
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you just want to clarify
 
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
that it was representative Douglas
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
Thomas that that did uh yes okay I
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
forgot to clarify on that
 
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
and then the final bill that was changed
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
by the or did you want to say something
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
on on 281 yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
um I'd just like to ask what is the
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
process for us to officially agree
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to concur or not
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
doing you know because we we've
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
certainly been discussing the um
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
the variety of changes that are in HP
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
281 in terms of you know positive
 
00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:56.339 align:start position:0%
positive law versus stuff we would
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
prefer not see in law so what would be
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
the process for that
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
so that we're undergoing that process
 
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
right now we want to discuss it here in
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
committee and but ultimately the
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
decision rests with the with the
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
committee chair
 
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:16.019 align:start position:0%
okay so if if we have uh a disagreeing
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
opinion then
 
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
you can express it and
 
00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:23.459 align:start position:0%
okay either here or on the house floor
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
and let's see was there one other did I
 
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
just discuss uh no I didn't discuss HP
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
139 HP 139 which was the elimination of
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
Municipal boundaries in the
 
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh Municipal group host net metering
 
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.269 align:start position:0%
uh Municipal group host net metering
bill

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
was replaced in its entirety because
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
that text has now been added to HB 281
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
it was replaced in its entirety
 
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.889 align:start position:0%
it was replaced in its entirety
by

00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
the text of an amendment that
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
representative Summers had prepared
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
during our discussions of Senate bill
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
167. that was the hydrogen bill
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
which we ultimately rejected
 
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
but the Senate really
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
once to get a definition of green
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
hydrogen into statute because the Senate
 
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
believes and they have convinced me that
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
we need to have that definition in
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
statute and under in order to qualify
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
for federal dollars apparently there are
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
quite a few federal dollars that are
 
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.269 align:start position:0%
quite a few federal dollars that are
available

00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
but if you don't have that
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
definition and statute it it hurts your
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
chances to qualify for some of those
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
federal dollars
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
so they replaced the text of 139 with
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
the text of Senate bill
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
167 minus any references to tax credits
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
or other subsidies for hydrogen
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
projects going forward and so I'm going
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
to recommend that we concur
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
on that bill as well
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm welcome to hear any discussion
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
on any of these bills from
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
the folks assembled here this morning
 
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative McGee I think when we
 
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
were discussing 281 I didn't I didn't
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
think I heard you say there's also the
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
disillusion of the easy board
 
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
which is another thing yes I I mentioned
 
00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
that did you yes okay so I guess most
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
people here are not all that familiar
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
with what the easy board is or does but
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
we did have a meeting of the easy board
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
on Friday that we were both at
 
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
um where folks were both shocked and
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
dismayed uh at the idea of that that
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
work being
 
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.730 align:start position:0%
work being
um

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
stopped I I guess I won't say stymied
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
because it'll be completely stopped
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
um so is it appropriate for us to have a
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
conversation about
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
yes we can talk about that but I'm going
 
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
to suggest that we wait until after our
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
presentation because I don't want to
 
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
hold these folks from Dartmouth up too
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
much longer but if you want to have a
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
conversation about that we can do that
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
so now let's uh turn our attention to a
 
00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:19.190 align:start position:0%
so now let's uh turn our attention to a
presentation

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.990 align:start position:0%
presentation
that

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.670 align:start position:0%
that
the

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
policy research shop at Dartmouth asked
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
me if I wanted them to do any research
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
for us back in the fall and I said yes
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
you could look into the question of
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
whether biomass electricity can be
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
generated in New Hampshire
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
or New England without subsidies and so
 
00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:43.139 align:start position:0%
they have done that and they have a
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
presentation here for us this morning so
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to turn the floor over to
 
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
mayhack batra and Beatrice capio
 
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
so that they can tell us what they've
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
discovered and welcome to you both
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming down making the
 
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:00.860 align:start position:0%
Trek from Hanover down here this morning
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
thankfully the weather was good I hope
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
you had a pleasant ride and uh
 
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
we'll uh probably ask you some questions
 
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
as you go along but we'll look forward
 
00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:14.459 align:start position:0%
to hearing your presentation so take it
 
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:19.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose members of the committee
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased to join you today and
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
Concord alongside my colleague Beatrice

capio my name is mahak batra and the two
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
of us are researchers at the policy
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
class of 1964 policy research shop from

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
the policy research shop produces
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
non-partisan policy analyzes and we
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
present our findings today in a
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
non-advocacy manner
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
today we'll be presenting on biomass
 
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
electricity generation and capacity in
 
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is the subject of a
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
recent report that has been circulated
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
to the committee by the center and my
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues we are here to present the
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
facts on this important issue today
 
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
we will begin with an overview of
 
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
biomass before discussing our research
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
design and findings we'll look forward
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
to your questions barring any immediate
 
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
needs at the end of the presentation we
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
to start off biomass refers to any plant
 
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
or plant-derived material that can be
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
converted into energy this includes not
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
only wood but also agricultural residues
 
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
Municipal solid waste and gas extracted
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
from landfills these products can be
 
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
burned in to produce heat that powers
 
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
electric generators are processed into
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
biofuels for transportation applications
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
today we will be focusing on Wood
 
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
related biomass electricity generation
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
due to the extensive forests and solid
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
tonnage of wood-related biomass
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
resources as depicted here in New
 
00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
resources as depicted here in New
Hampshire

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
it is worth noting that while widely
 
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
considered a renewable energy source the
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
sustainability of biomass and practice
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
is somewhat debated
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
drawing on the context of where we're
 
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
coming from from the Upper Valley
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
Professor Andrew Friedland from
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth authored a recent opinion
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
column in the Valley news about the
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
hidden costs of Wood-Fired and wood
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
biomass not too long after Professor Ben
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
Steele of Colby Sawyer College responded
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
noting that plants have found ways to
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
manage emissions and arguing that
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
biomass is an important element of an
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
electrical generation mix our report in
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
part seeks to situate the viability of
 
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
lastly biomass has historically not been
 
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
price competitive with other electricity
 
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
sources motivating the generation of our
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
report and research question
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
our subsidies required for biomass

electricity generation in New Hampshire
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
which asks whether subsidies are
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
required for biomass electricity
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%

00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
the report takes a two-pronged approach
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
to considering this problem first the
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
in the report we compare biomass among

other electricity sources when it comes
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
to the construction and maintenance for
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
biomass related infrastructure
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
we conclude
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
sorry first excuse me to understand it
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
fully if biomass is economically viable
 
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
we first compare biomass to other energy
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
sources it's first important to compare
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
the fuel costs of other sources both
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%

00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
how they compare to biomass in the field
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
of energy production fuel costs are
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
often the greatest expense for power
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
plants and the fluctuations in price of
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
feedstock can significantly influence
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity being produced
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:45.500 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
7.64 cents per thousand cubic feet
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
producing one megawatt of electricity
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
requires a combustion of seven thousand
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
six hundred thousand cubic feet
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
producing one megawatt of electricity
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
requires the combustion of 7 600 cubic
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
feet of natural gas the data in table
 
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
two from the eia
 
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
right here shows that the biomass
 
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
electricity has slightly lower fuel
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
costs than natural gas it takes like I
 
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:11.660 align:start position:0%
said before
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
18.50 to 32 dollars of wood to produce
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
one megawatt of electricity whereas for
 
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
natural gas it's required to produce the
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
same megawatt hour which would cost
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
around 58 dollars
 
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.150 align:start position:0%
around 58 dollars
okay

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
we also demonstrate that wood chip
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
prices as seen here are highly variable
 
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
year to year and do not reflect the full
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
story of the biomass generation cost
 
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
thus relative comparisons with other
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
energy sources are more useful from an
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
economic analysis standpoint than purely
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
centering wood or the fuel for this
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
in the report we also compare biomass
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
among other electricity sources when it
 
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
comes to the construction and
 
00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299 align:start position:0%
maintenance required for biomass related
 
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we conclude that biomass
 
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
construction and maintenance costs are
 
00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
significantly higher compared to other
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
sources of electricity when considering
 
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
their relative output further we
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
considered how the price of electricity
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
has changed per megawatt over time we
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
see that the market price rarely reaches
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
or exceeds the subsidy price considered
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
and set under sp365 which was a previous
 
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
subsidy put in place in New Hampshire
 
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
thus prior to New Hampshire subsidy
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
levels did not adequately or thoroughly
 
00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
affect the biomass generation market and
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
traditionally subsidized renewable

dollars per megawatt hour a
 
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
representative from the plant talked
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
about their positive relationship with
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
State leadership and the necessity of
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
subsidies at the federal and state
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
levels to support fair pricing like
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
through a tax credit program
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
next we look at Maine
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
Lisa Smith from the governor's Energy
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
Office described that the cost of
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
operating means biomass generation
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
plants exceeded revenues per year by
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
around one to two million dollars in the
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
past couple years
 
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
talking with Eric Kingsley from
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
Innovative resource Solutions we further
 
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539 align:start position:0%
learned that biomass plants are required
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
to sell their electricity at around 5
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour and that plants
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
must buy their fuel at less than ten
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
dollars and eight cents per ton in order
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
to break even
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
thus Kingsley and Smith underlined the
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
need for policy intervention in order to
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
support the viability of biomass as a
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
renewable source of electricity in Maine
 
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
and describe the need for a related
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
moreover all three of these states share
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
a similar climate High Forest cover
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
population density and energy demand
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
but what separates them is the renewable
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
energy standards and state assistance
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
that they offer energy providers all
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
three states also have unique class
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
total eight percent falls under the

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
bill are referenced throughout the paper
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
such as the study on the economic
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%

generation resources in New Hampshire
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
and found that high and consistent
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
subsidies for the biomass industry would
 
00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
be needed to work with New Hampshire's
 
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard this low renewable
 
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
portfolio energy standard has deterred
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
the biomass industry from taking off
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the other hand Vermont's renewable
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
energy standard does not have any
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
distinctions for when a facility began
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
operations even though the state has
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
much higher standard requiring 55
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
percent of its energy to come from
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
renewable sources in 2017 their system
 
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
allows for flexibility in the Vermont's
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
RPS similarly Maine has high standards
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
it requires eighty percent of its
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
electricity to be supplied by renewable
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
sources by 2030. Maine requires that 30
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
of its load must be satisfied by
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
renewable electricity generating
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
generation in 2019 under Class 2 and 10
 
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
percent must be satisfied by a new
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
renewable sources under class one and an
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
increasing number of amounts of
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
renewable energy under class 1a and
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
thermal renewable energy credits thus
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
both states have higher standards for
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
renewable energy production
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
because both Vermont and Maine require
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
such a high portion of their energy
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
portfolio come from renewable sources
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
and biomasses in excess because of high
 
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
Force cover in their respective States
 
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
they facilitate a process for biomass
 
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
with State assistance these
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
considerations could potentially point
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
to why New Hampshire struggles with
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
supporting biomass production and will
 
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
in summary through this research we
 
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
first first spoke with experts and
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
stakeholders developed two case studies
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
and reached out to biomass facilities
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
then we considered the economic
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
feasibility of biomass electricity in
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the state's current
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
renewable energy standards and lastly as
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
my colleague just noted we could have
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
concluded that subsidies and policy
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
intervention are necessary for biomass
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
to thrive in New Hampshire
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire is committed to a
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard the state
 
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
may need to seek investment in
 
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
alternative energy sources in order to
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
generate electricity more cleanly and
 
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.730 align:start position:0%
generate electricity more cleanly and
sustainably

00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
sustainably
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
with the state's vast Forest resources
 
00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
what represents a possible alternative
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
to traditional fossil fuels however
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
adopting any new fuel source like wood
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
in the state's energy portfolio
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
generates questions of viability and
 
00:27:12.419 --> 00:27:13.370 align:start position:0%
generates questions of viability and
cost

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
next steps for this committee and
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
broader research on renewable energy in
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could involve the study of
 
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
the specific subsidy level required for
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
biomasses viability in New Hampshire and
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy standards in the
 
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:27.299 align:start position:0%
state as well as consideration of the
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
relative viability of other non-biomass
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention and time we
 
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
look forward to your questions on the
 
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.669 align:start position:0%
look forward to your questions on the
research

00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:42.539 align:start position:0%
and thank you for a excellent
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
presentation we appreciated that
 
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure the committee has some
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
questions for you so who wants to go
 
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
first anybody
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi will go first
 
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you folks
 
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.169 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you folks
so

00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
you've indicated that a subsidy is
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
necessary what are we looking at T-Rex
 
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
and what level of uh subsidy is
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh I guess expected to be necessary to
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
obviously this was like out of our scope
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
of research to look at what level of
 
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.730 align:start position:0%
of research to look at what level of
subsidy

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
subsidy
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
um we looked at but
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
um if you look at this
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
graph right here for SB 365 the subsidy
 
00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:42.539 align:start position:0%
the market repair price never really
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
went above 50 except for the polar
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
vortex of 2014 so we would expect if you
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
were to do further research it would
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
be around that 50 amount but of course
 
00:28:57.289 --> 00:28:57.299 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
be a point of further research for you
 
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.950 align:start position:0%
be a point of further research for you
guys

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
guys
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:09.419 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki uh thank you Mr
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.049 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
um

00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
one of the things I keep wondering about
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
I actually visited the Bridgewater plant
 
00:29:16.679 --> 00:29:18.889 align:start position:0%
I actually visited the Bridgewater plant
and

00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
um the issue that I am concerned with is
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
latent heat of vaporization of water
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
basically if you send water up the
 
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
chimney it's going to cost you're not
 
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:31.820 align:start position:0%
going to be producing energy efficiently
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
and if
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
um even with dry wood
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some of that and so
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'll say that that was not this you know
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
primary subject of this report
 
00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
um but certainly you know further
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
research could consider the efficiency
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
of individual plants themselves and how
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
for example they differ with regard uh
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
to you know using dry wood and wetwood
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:12.059 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the case study in
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
Vermont you said that it receives
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
federal and state subsidies did you
 
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
break that down into uh percentage of
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:25.250 align:start position:0%
uh we did not
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:29.450 align:start position:0%
uh we did not
[Music]

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
federal and state subsidies what we can
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
say is that
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
so the when we talked to the McNeil
 
00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
generating plant they did not receive
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
any direct subsidies what they did
 
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
receive is a 5.16 million dollar Grant
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
um in conjunction with um several local
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
organizations this grant has just I
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
think gone into effect this past year
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
and that you can look into several news
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
sources have talked about it and we can
 
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
provide more information for you guys
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
about this but um that is what they're
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
working on right now it's a huge Federal
 
00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419 align:start position:0%
grant has just gone into effect and it
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
was coordinated by Representative
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
Patrick Leahy
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and I would just add to
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
that briefly on page nine of the report
 
00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
if you have it in front of you
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's been circulated to
 
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
this committee uh we also at the McNiel
 
00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
plant they described the federal
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
renewable electricity production tax
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
credit for example so there are various
 
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
tax credit programs that this committee
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
may want to look into on that point let
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
me clarify real quickly the report has
 
00:31:45.889 --> 00:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
not been sent to all members of the
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
committee yet
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
I plan to do that later today I did not
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
want to send them send it to them prior
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
to your presentation because I didn't
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
want to steal any of your thunder
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
but the full report will be made
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
available to the committee shortly
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
we hope out not just from this
 
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
presentation but also from the full
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
report it also I believe is available on
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
um the Rockefeller Center's website
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
under policy research briefs sure
 
00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:21.539 align:start position:0%
representative floje uh thank you Jimmy
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh along with the report
 
00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.059 align:start position:0%
if you could uh ask if the
 
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
testimony presented could be included
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
could you provide your written testimony
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
um to the committee as well
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
speaker notes
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah there are more Yes you heard
 
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:48.020 align:start position:0%
your notes
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
sure yeah
 
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.850 align:start position:0%
sure yeah
representative

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:51.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
follow-up I think electronically will be
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
enough to save paper and all
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
for you know we don't need all the
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
printouts just to come yes hard copy not
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
required just email will be fine we're
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
more than happy to do so
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
um also refer the committee to the
 
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
references section of the report itself
 
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
which I understand will be made
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
available soon it references for example
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
um you know as we've noted in the
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
presentation the various stakeholders
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
that were interviewed so if you're
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
interested in perhaps corresponding with
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
them directly that would also be a good
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
point of contact
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question for you you
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
briefly mentioned in your presentation
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
that there were a couple of op-eds
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
written by
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth professors about this question
 
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
did you read those and could you Briefly
 
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
so um Prof
 
00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:52.019 align:start position:0%
ESS Friedland we first talked to him and
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
then he talked in the Valley News and he
 
00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.019 align:start position:0%
was one of the first people
 
00:33:58.019 --> 00:33:58.970 align:start position:0%
was one of the first people
um

00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.250 align:start position:0%
um
who

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:00.260 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
discussed how biomass generation is not
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
a viable source of
 
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.149 align:start position:0%
a viable source of
um

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
like um
 
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
electricity generation in New Hampshire
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
um that was like the basic premise of
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
his argument and from there we went off
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
and did our research and the
 
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.070 align:start position:0%
and did our research and the
next

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
thing we mentioned was from Ben Steele
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
who's from a Kobe Sawyer College he's
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually not a Dartmouth professor and
 
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
he responded to Professor Friedland and
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
basically said to the opposite and that
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
was kind of what sparked our research in
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
this debate whether it's biomass
 
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
sustainable is biomass economically
 
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
viable it kind of like spurred what
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're kind of looking at as our Crux of
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
the argument these two points is that
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
first economically viable and two is it
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
economically competitive it's like both
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
and both of those sources are mentioned
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
in your references in the report
 
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
and they're both also on the Valley News
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
great okay I'd refer the committee
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
specifically to page one of the report
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
that will be circulated for my
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
understanding shortly uh which
 
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
references both professors and their
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
their columns from Dartmouth and Colby
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
Sawyer respectively
 
00:35:26.099 --> 00:35:28.069 align:start position:0%
Sawyer respectively
right

00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for being here
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
today this is a well done report I
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
appreciate the limited scope I think
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful
 
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
um for you know levelized data and all
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
that it's very it's very well done
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
um my question is around for follow-up
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
you were talking about there are many
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
different aspects you could follow
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
but um on the page with the uh
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
it wasn't this one yeah was the
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
comparing fuel costs
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
I think we're always very concerned with
 
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.609 align:start position:0%
I think we're always very concerned with
that

00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
um that aspect of cost but when we had
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
hearings on biomass in New Hampshire
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
we heard from industries that relied on
 
00:36:17.569 --> 00:36:17.579 align:start position:0%
or were compatible with the biomass
 
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
plants that existed at the time and
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
there was conversation around sort of
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit analysis of having
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
economic stimulus in the energy sector
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
that was in State versus sending dollars
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
so I wonder if in terms of the economics
 
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
any of the externalities Beyond RPS
 
00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:40.460 align:start position:0%
compliance or you know other
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
policy pieces that are put in place were
 
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
considered in terms of the
 
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
sure we can describe a couple you're
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth so we want to put you
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
through the ringer yeah thank you we can
 
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
describe a couple
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
um you know other components that went
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
into kind of the economic viability
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
angle of this one of them was about job
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
creation and that's referenced
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the report with regard to
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
kind of the existing jobs in biomass in
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire the other
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
research that we did also looked a
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
little bit at what those kind of
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say necessarily failing
 
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
but at least
 
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
um biomass plants that fall kind of down
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
the less efficient end of the Spectrum
 
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and those I will say
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
kind of to your point about keeping
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
resources in state I believe a main
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
company actually has at least been in
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
exercises to acquire those plants so I'd
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
say that that is another angle that we
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
looked at so both the jobs angle in the
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as well as as I
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
was just referencing ultimately where
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know these plants are and who owns
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
and operates them which appears to be
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:14.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so uh
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki brought up the
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
the concept of ensuring that we have dry
 
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.890 align:start position:0%
the concept of ensuring that we have dry
wood

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:20.900 align:start position:0%
wood
 
00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.510 align:start position:0%
wood
it

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
maximizes the efficiency of these of
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
these plants when you looked and
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
discussed at the different plants did
 
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
you identify Optimum ways of drying is
 
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.810 align:start position:0%
you identify Optimum ways of drying is
it

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:34.820 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
covered material materials uh out in the
 
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:44.180 align:start position:0%
sun chipped uh what what activity
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
sure I would say that we didn't
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
necessarily look directly into you know
 
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
how to optimize the wood drawing process
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
what I will say is that as our previous
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
slides have shown just generally the
 
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
wood chip Market tends to be quite
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
variable year to year so that can make
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
it a little bit difficult to decipher
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
between years and the relative
 
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:13.220 align:start position:0%
efficiency at drying wood
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
additionally we looked a little bit at
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know the plants themselves and
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
compared them especially among this like
 
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:23.300 align:start position:0%
class one class two class three
 
00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
spectrum and so hopefully that can
 
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit of an angle but we
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily look at this idea of
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
optimal wood drawing I suppose
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
not her
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I said okay I didn't hear it
 
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
I was just thinking back a couple of
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
terms ago I think we we had um all day
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
hearing and we had different people
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
representing businesses that benefit
 
00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
from biomass like uh one was talking
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
about how clearing the forests helps
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
prevent forest fires uh there was a
 
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
woman who her business was to collect
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
the Ash and they used it as fertilizer
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
and I wondered if these other businesses
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
were taken into consideration when you
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
researched your report and the cost
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:21.140 align:start position:0%
so we reached out to as many
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
organizations as possible we reached out
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
to like
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
um the logging industry like different
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
types of stakeholders most of them did
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
not respond we also reached out to the
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy to
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
ask for more stakeholders so
 
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
and they gave us some names
 
00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
um most of them were not able to get
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
back to us in time for this report to be
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
released but we did try to get um the
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
most type of reach we could to answer
 
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
the question as best we could
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
I'd also just add to that briefly
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
obviously you know there's a
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
equilibrium amount of forest cover that
 
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
is appropriate in the state so with
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
regard to you know the use of those
 
00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:08.339 align:start position:0%
resources we need to make sure that
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
whatever solution is implemented or way
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
that biomass and other forms of
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
electricity that rely on for example
 
00:41:17.569 --> 00:41:17.579 align:start position:0%
wood resources that whatever that is
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
ultimately ends up being renewable
 
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
um that whatever you know Solutions you
 
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
all are debating and end up considering
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
that they ultimately meet that kind of
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
renewable idea where we're not you know
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
using too much of something that we
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
can't get again forests are resilient
 
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:41.180 align:start position:0%
but we need to ensure that we're not
 
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily relying on them in such a
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
way that we're not diversifying the
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
electrical generation mix and I would
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
also note just as a general point that
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
the type of wood that's used in Wood
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
biomass generation is not you know
 
00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
pristine Lumber it tends to be
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
various kinds of you know I mean we're
 
00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
talking about wood chips but lower grade
 
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
wood uh and I would say that the report
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
itself which will be circulated soon
 
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
does a pretty good job of explaining the
 
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
types of wood that are used and kind of
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
how they fit in especially with the
 
00:42:18.849 --> 00:42:18.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question thank
 
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:23.339 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
questions uh for a very good
 
00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.930 align:start position:0%
questions uh for a very good
presentation

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if if you've given
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
any consideration to alternative uses
 
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
for the biomass fuel
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh were there other considerations given
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
there and is this the best use that can
 
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
a great question I would say that with
 
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
regard to the actual fuel used to
 
00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.870 align:start position:0%
regard to the actual fuel used to
generate

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
generate
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
biomass energy and relatedly electricity
 
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh certainly you know the timber for
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
example that is used the wood chips that
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
are used from our understanding are not
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
particularly useful in other contexts
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
given that they're of this lower grade
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
lower quality
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
I will also say that I think the report
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
considers for example you know where
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
exactly this wood is coming from and
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
concludes that for example we probably
 
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
could not be using the wood to put
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
together these wonderful desks in this
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
room today and thus our probably pretty
 
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.490 align:start position:0%
room today and thus our probably pretty
useful

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:27.500 align:start position:0%
useful
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
in biomass generation and the kind of
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
current context I'll also say that
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
biomass generally as the report goes
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
into in more depth can be used for more
 
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
than just electricity a lot of it
 
00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
happens to be used for for example
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
industrial heating even just Heating in
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
people's homes Transportation they're
 
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
more you know uses for biomass energy
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
itself than just you know creating the
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
current that we use to charge our
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you both for
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
being here and I just want to follow up
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
on representative Noel's question so I'm
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
imagining a world where we just don't
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
even have the capability to use biomass
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
to generate electricity or heat
 
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
there are these trees some of them are
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
useful some are not the ones that are
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
not that are harvested what could happen
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
to them then well what would would the
 
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
chips just pile up somewhere and and rot
 
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
and maybe Catch Fire I mean what any
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
ideas what the alternatives are
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I will direct you when you have the
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
report in front of you to page two which
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
goes into again what I've been
 
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
describing as low grade wood as well as
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
what is described as waste wood and I
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but I am not entirely sure
 
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
about you know the proportion of low
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
grade wood to waste what that goes into
 
00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:02.099 align:start position:0%
the biomass fuel pool but certainly
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
waste wood things like uh you know wood
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
that comes out of processing facilities
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
or you know that is procured from
 
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
Sawmills as we go into briefly uh
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
probably would not be particularly
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
useful in other contexts but I will say
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
that further research can consider that
 
00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:25.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you for your presentation
 
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
what not a lot of that would dust remain
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh in the wood lots and not be harvested
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
to begin with if there was not a use for
 
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.569 align:start position:0%
to begin with if there was not a use for
it

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:38.579 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
do a follow-up on time form of episode
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
she's going to make sure I understand
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
the question would the wood not be out
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
there would that so we're using for to
 
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
fuel these biomass plants if there was
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
no market for it uh the law the
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
Foresters would not be going to harvest
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
it to begin with is what I understand
 
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
perhaps good question uh again the
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
report didn't directly look into you
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
know where this waste would or low-grade
 
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
wood could go beyond biomass generation
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
I'll be clear on that I will say that I
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
think that the report makes clear though
 
00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
um some options for for example
 
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:26.579 align:start position:0%
um more efficient plants that may use
 
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
I guess a follow-up to that question
 
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
would be is that
 
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.390 align:start position:0%
would be is that
um

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
a side benefit from to biomass would be
 
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
ensuring that there is a market for the
 
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
waste wood so that we do have force that
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
are well managed that helps to pay for
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
the world management of our forests yeah
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
like a way you can look at biome the
 
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
Maya Mass industry is that like there's
 
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
this wood that is undesirable
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
as in like low-grade wood and the
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
biomass industry is basically a
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
byproduct of it
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
one of the sorry could I
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
present one of the other benefits that
 
00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
we read about within the context of
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
biomass energy generation in New
 
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically is also that New
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's kind of logging industry is
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
relatively traditional compared to
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
what's going on in other states meaning
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
that a lot of it is you know
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
the timber that you see on the highways
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
and hope it doesn't fall through your
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
windshield when you're driving to work
 
00:47:40.849 --> 00:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
or school every day and so one of the
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
benefits of biomass or I will just say
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
broader more alternative you know forms
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
of use for this wood is that it would
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
kind of revitalize for example the
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
logging industry and to your point we're
 
00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
not 100 sure based on this report you
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
know where that would may go elsewhere
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
but one of the perks of biomass
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
electricity generation is that it kind
 
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
of steers at least part of the existing
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
industry in the state away from more
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
traditional forms
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
of production that makes sense and it
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
also just helps generally with Forest
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
management I did read an article where
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
it said that like forest fires and um
 
00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
other like bushfires and things like
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
that are managed because of this bipart
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
product of the biomass industry
 
00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:35.579 align:start position:0%
there is a legislatively established
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
commission that is looking into this
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
question of alternative uses for biomass
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's been in operation for
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
at least a year and I'm not sure when
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
its first report is due but they have
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
been making progress in in coming up
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
with some alternative uses for for
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
biomass representative McGee has a
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
question thank you thanks for taking my
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
question again this is kind of a
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
two-parter when we were having those
 
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
hearings I heard from a constituent who
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
owned a large tract of land
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
and his concern was that the value of
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
the land that many of the people who own
 
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:16.460 align:start position:0%
the forest in the state
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
would be devalued by the fact that the
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
low-grade Timber no longer had value
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
which was helping him pay his taxes and
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so I just thought
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
that was an interesting angle because
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
it could very much mean that some people
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
will not be able to hold on to their
 
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
properties and they will be sold to the
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
highest bidder outside the state so the
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
change in the whole traditional
 
00:49:36.359 --> 00:49:37.750 align:start position:0%
change in the whole traditional
ecosystem

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
ecosystem
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
around uh around the harvesting of the
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
low-grade Timber I think is a question
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
that for for thinking about because it
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
is back to economics right the what is
 
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
how is it viable how are we using it is
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
it being used locally and is there even
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
an economics to getting it from point A
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
to point B so that when it gets to that
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
factory and they have to pay for that
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
transport and that logging does it all
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
get rolled into the price at a feasible
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
price right so that's um the first one I
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to make but the second thing is
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
you were talking also about how there
 
00:50:16.609 --> 00:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
were better and worse run plants and I
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
know we heard testimony from our
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
um were
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
allowing plants to be considered
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
renewable in terms of wrecks or tracks
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
based upon what they had been doing to
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
make sure that any emissions coming from
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
the plant have been cleaned up to a
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
certain degree So when you say better or
 
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
worse or whatever
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
labels you used can you describe for us
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
if there is any difference as far as you
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
know in terms of how renewable plants
 
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
are these days because my understanding
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
is the technology has improved but I
 
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the first distinction that
 
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
you can make and the distinctions will
 
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
be made clear in the report is between
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
first class 1 and class three biomass
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
plants class one biomass sorry class one
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
biomass plants are new renewable energy
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
plants they started operation after like
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
January 2006 and they first have higher
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
efficiency rates than class 3 biomass
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
plants and are going to be your most
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
renewable and clean biomass plants class
 
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
3 biomass plants which they're not many
 
00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:35.180 align:start position:0%
of left anymore
 
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:38.540 align:start position:0%
are going to be less efficient
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
and are going to be the ones that are a
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
little bit poorer in terms of outputting
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
and of having this renewable aspect to
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
them they also are the ones I guess
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
we're trying to focus on today in terms
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
of looking at like costs and looking at
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
but whether they're like need subsidies
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
because they are the ones unfortunately
 
00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.890 align:start position:0%
because they are the ones unfortunately
struggling

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that the previous testimony
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
noted and explicated a little bit more
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
in depth than we have today exactly what
 
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
efficiency means um with regard to
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
electricity generation in broader energy
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
generation but when we look at biomass
 
00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059 align:start position:0%
power right now it's estimated that the
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency of plants is about 25 to 30
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
percent and this compares to you for
 
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.809 align:start position:0%
percent and this compares to you for
example

00:52:31.809 --> 00:52:31.819 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy power which is roughly 50
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
percent of New Hampshire's electricity
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you all are aware and is
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
about 34 to 36 percent efficient I'm
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
reading from page two and you all have
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
the report in front of you and the newer
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
nuclear plants for example can be up to
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
39 efficient so hopefully that gives you
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
a sense of kind of the trajectory
 
00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.410 align:start position:0%
a sense of kind of the trajectory
generally

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
um among different forms of electricity
 
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
with regard to their efficiency and how
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
that is progressing as newer technology
 
00:53:08.569 --> 00:53:08.579 align:start position:0%
is available I will also note that one
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
of the difficulties that we talk about
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
the this distinction between Class 1 and
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
class 3 plants is that it's not
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
particularly straightforward as you may
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
imagine to create a new plant or in some
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
ways I don't believe it's right now
 
00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:23.819 align:start position:0%
possible to convert a plant from like a
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
class three plant to a class one plant
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
and as our previous slide showed
 
00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
um for example on the left we see the
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
average construction cost of uh
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
different plants for different forms of
 
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
energy generation and we see that
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
essentially the payoff for a biomass
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh isn't particularly comparable to
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
what's going on with other forms
 
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
electricity essentially underlining that
 
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
biomass plants are really expensive to
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
make and their actual efficiency even
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
when they are good and we're investing a
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
lot in them you know it's still pretty
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has another
 
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman I'm
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
not sure whether it's a question a
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
comment or what but I think in terms of
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
looking at efficiency
 
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
the whole system efficiency would seem
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
to have to be included a nuclear plant
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
has very few Transportation costs but if
 
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
you start adding in transportation costs
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
and so forth for biomass call whatever
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
um it would seem that that would be a
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
yes we've tried to minimize uh kind of
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
the math you will have to do in reading
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
the report with regard to what for
 
00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
example those Transportation costs
 
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
you're describing especially with regard
 
00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
to a comparison to nuclear power
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
um for example with regard to the
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
Vermont numbers if we look at the McNeil
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
plant these net operating costs for
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
example we're discussing are inclusive
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
of transportation for example so
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully that can better help the
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
committee and you for example in
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
determining exactly you know more
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
fairer comparison among other sources
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
but certainly a concern but I do want to
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
note for nuclear which is also included
 
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
in your 10-year strategy report that was
 
00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:23.099 align:start position:0%
released I think this past year is that
 
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
um it does have this zero carbon aspect
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
to it which makes it a little and it is
 
00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:31.460 align:start position:0%
a little bit more cost competitive
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
compared to biomass which makes it I
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
think a more viable source of energy at
 
00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Noel
 
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
the hard question that we as a committee
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
have to answer is does the State of New
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire want to continue subsidizing
 
00:55:55.089 --> 00:55:55.099 align:start position:0%
biomass have you looked into this enough
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
to form an opinion on that
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
sure well reiterate to the committee
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
that we're hearing a non-advocacy manner
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
so we're just describing
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
um you know how New Hampshire is faring
 
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
relative to you know our neighbors in
 
00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
Maine and Vermont and I would say that
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
two things two kind of possible Paths of
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
action were determined in creating this
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
report one is that there could be some
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
version of a more direct I'm not going
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
to say direct because that has
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
connotations but a more direct form of
 
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
subsidization for the plants themselves
 
00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and the
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
other as my colleague kind of alluded to
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
toward the end is that the actual
 
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
renewable energy standards could be
 
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
shifted in a way that would change the
 
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
electrical generation mix and
 
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
potentially support you know further
 
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
subsidies for biomass plants so they're
 
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
not here today to necessarily provide
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
you with a subsidy level that makes
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
sense I know we described a little bit
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know within the context of the
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
subsidy Level under SB 365 5 which of
 
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.730 align:start position:0%
subsidy Level under SB 365 5 which of
course

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
is rather contentious for my
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
understanding here but hopefully our the
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
report gives a sense of you know future
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
Paths of action either directly or
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
indirectly out of this committee and out
 
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
of this house and government and you
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
know can help at least provide a little
 
00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:20.819 align:start position:0%
bit of a bigger picture about what's
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
going on elsewhere
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you again
 
00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:30.059 align:start position:0%
so going back to what we were just
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
talking about the construction cost
 
00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'm struck by the the cost for biomass
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
being twice as much as anything else
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
except solar where it's almost twice as
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
much and you know I think about solar
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
which of course uses a lot of land
 
00:57:49.609 --> 00:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
what accounts for the very high
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question and I will
 
00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
say that the report again did not look
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
directly into the mechanics of
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
individual biomass plants
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
um but certainly we can see that the you
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
know cost comparison
 
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
um demonstrates that biomass is pretty
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
expensive when it comes to creating a
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
new plant the reason I will say that
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
explains part of you know frankly not
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
spending all too much time researching
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
on that question is that we're looking
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
specifically at the existing biomass
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
plants and not necessarily the
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
construction of new ones in this context
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
but certainly if the state is in the
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
long term interest in investing in the
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
construction of new plants cost would be
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
a bigger issue there
 
00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
also um heating infrastructure makes the
 
00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
cost of the plant become really high
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
yeah the actual process of like
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
producing electricity based on like from
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
biomass is pretty technical we've got to
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
have the boiler we've got to be burning
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
something and you know of course making
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
that boiler work which spins the term
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
line which goes to generator like it's
 
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
it's quite involved compared to some of
 
00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:12.059 align:start position:0%
these other sources for example if we
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
just think of you know what a wind
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
turbine looks like for example the
 
00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
infrastructure just looks pretty
 
00:59:16.619 --> 00:59:17.809 align:start position:0%
infrastructure just looks pretty
different

00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question for you the
 
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
levelized cost of energy slide
 
00:59:29.809 --> 00:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
could you tell us where you got your
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
levelized cost of energy for each of
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
these categories and did it include
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
the cost to backup intermittent
 
00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:43.430 align:start position:0%
the cost to backup intermittent
generation

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't believe it included the cost
 
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
to backup intermittent generation first
 
00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
off and this is a national number so
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
these are not New Hampshire specific
 
00:59:56.569 --> 00:59:56.579 align:start position:0%
this is from the wealth management and
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
National Financial advisory firm Lazard
 
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
and this is the same graph that was
 
01:00:03.849 --> 01:00:03.859 align:start position:0%
included in your 10-year New Hampshire
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
energy strategy report released last
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
year and it's just to show that wind and
 
01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
solar is the only unsubsidized or the
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
only cost competitive
 
01:00:15.839 --> 01:00:17.289 align:start position:0%
only cost competitive
um

01:00:17.289 --> 01:00:17.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
renewable energy sources that are
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
competitive with conventional sources
 
01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579 align:start position:0%
such as
 
01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:24.289 align:start position:0%
such as
um

01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:24.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
natural gas and in some cases coal so
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
that is what I wanted to show I
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
understand that the figure is a little
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
bit complicated but at the Baseline that
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
is all I wanted to show with this figure
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
and to underline again this is an up
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
subsidized analysis to begin with so
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
hopefully that gives the committee a
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
pretty good sense of kind of where are
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
these sources of um energy fair in
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
comparison to one another without
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
subsidies or anything like that
 
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
um and further I'll just note on the
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
intermittent for example note that you
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
were describing
 
01:00:59.210 --> 01:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we were looking at
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
is for example with regard to Coal we
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
know that coal can be used in state of
 
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if it's particularly high
 
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
demand season for example and just to
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
kind of underline this point that this
 
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
is a national analysis not everywhere is
 
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
going to have the kind of polar vortexes
 
01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:17.339 align:start position:0%
that we see here that cause for example
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
that big spike if we go back to the
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
subsidy graph here so it depends across
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
the country where you're looking at
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
every state also has different resources
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
different infrastructure for example but
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
that we see nationally generally
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
speaking in that levelized analysis how
 
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
different forms of energy compare
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative floje uh thank you chair
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
thank you for your research and your
 
01:01:43.619 --> 01:01:45.049 align:start position:0%
thank you for your research and your
presentation

01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:45.059 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:01:45.059 --> 01:01:45.770 align:start position:0%
presentation
um

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
I do understand page three you're
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
focused on one item of
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
is there subsidies uh economical for
 
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
wood of bio
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
in your research
 
01:02:01.609 --> 01:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
as we found out in research have you
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
found any other lines you did not go on
 
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
because that was not part of your charge
 
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
such as all many of the other
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
generators have subsidies also
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't look into canases survive
 
01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:20.579 align:start position:0%
did you notice where we could have gone
 
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
with a research
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
a tangent if I could say of the rate of
 
01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:29.420 align:start position:0%
return to New Hampshire's rate payers
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
and taxpayers
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
on subsidies you know like you heard
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
the logging industry the tourists
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
upgrading our Force
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
is there another report out there thank
 
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.089 align:start position:0%
is there another report out there thank
you

01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
um yeah there are a lot of different
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
directions we could have gone with our
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
research in terms of rate of return for
 
01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:54.059 align:start position:0%
rate pairs
 
01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
um there was a report that we did
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
reference a lot in our research and did
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
look at a lot in her research and that
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
was a report released in 2018 by New
 
01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:06.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire itself it's the report on
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
economic viability of class 3 biomass
 
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.690 align:start position:0%
economic viability of class 3 biomass
facilities

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
um and that found that the rate of
 
01:03:13.079 --> 01:03:13.970 align:start position:0%
um and that found that the rate of
return

01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
um the cost of
 
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
um for rate pairs for um subsidies was 3
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
million from 2014 to 2017 for this SB
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
365 and other subsidies
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
um and of course there was a lot of
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
different analysis that that report did
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
it's a 52-page report
 
01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:36.299 align:start position:0%
um I think that would be a really
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
insightful report to look at if you guys
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
were to do further research on doing
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
another subsidy and which level of
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
subsidy you would like to do on class
 
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
three in class one biomass abilities in
 
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
the future but um in terms of doing
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
further research there were a lot of
 
01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
different directions we could go of
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
course we were limited in scope and the
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
people who responded to us but um yeah
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
we also know that there's a great deal
 
01:04:03.049 --> 01:04:03.059 align:start position:0%
of research as you all have alluded to
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
um with regard to study on this issue in
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
um both from you know for example you
 
01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
know policy researchers like ourselves
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
but also within the state
 
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
um my colleague referenced for example
 
01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
this report from 2018 and December from
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire office of strategic
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
initiatives so it's a study on the
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
economic viability of specifically those
 
01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.299 align:start position:0%
class III plants which is referenced
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the report and I would
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
recommend and hopefully this
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
presentation and report that we have put
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
together can Inspire as my colleague
 
01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:38.579 align:start position:0%
alluded to some further research both
 
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
you know externally and also within for
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
example offices the office of strategic
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
initiatives and other entities within
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
yes having read that 2018 report by
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
Matthew Mayu I can highly recommend it
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
excellent report
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
well seeing none I want to thank you
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
both for a wonderful presentation and a
 
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
very informative report which the
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
committee will have in its hands shortly
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
and if we have questions could we ask
 
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
you're more than welcome to contact
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the names listed on the
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
report as well as our own names listed
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
on the slides today and I am sure the
 
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
center could get you it get you all in
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
touch with us directly as well and I
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
also reference the policy research Shop
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
website for general information about
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
these types of analyzes and also again
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
the brief if you're interested in seeing
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%

email later today
 
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
wonderful and I'd also like to thank
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank Michael Wales for setting uh
 
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
who I guess you're the director of the
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
faculty Mentor okay well whatever your
 
01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:05.660 align:start position:0%
role we appreciate you performing it and
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
helping us out with arranging for this
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
report and for
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
coming here this morning to present it
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
to us we thank you all of you
 
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
so before we wrap up our activity this
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
morning I know representative McGee you
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
wanted to discuss a little bit about the
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
amendments to Senate to House Bill 281
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
this is specifically research the
 
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
amendment regarding the repeal of the
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
easy board
 
01:06:41.089 --> 01:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
yes I I think uh the points that I
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to make are it sometimes it's
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
referred to as a Christmas tree bill
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
right a number of different bills get
 
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
attached or an Omnibus or
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
quasi Omnibus or a half Omnibus
 
01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:55.619 align:start position:0%
um and what ends up happening is there
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
are bills that you would like to see
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
advance in bills that you really would
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
oppose and I think that's the case
 
01:07:06.049 --> 01:07:06.059 align:start position:0%
um for myself on 281
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
um I think there's been a lot of
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
discussion around how the least cost
 
01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:12.020 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning
 
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
process needed revamping for current
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
circumstances but as I mentioned in the
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill in the Senate
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
um we just passed Senate Bill 54
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
allowing the utilities to enter into
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
long-term purchase power agreements and
 
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
that creates a situation that's very
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
similar to the reason that the least
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
cost integrated resource planning was
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
put in place in the first place to to
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
protect people from long-term stranded
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
costs for Capital Investments or
 
01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
Investments that are larger being
 
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
entered into by the utilities so I see
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
it being
 
01:07:52.559 --> 01:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
it being
um

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.309 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
not wise for us to say let's eliminate
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
least cost integrated resource planning
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
before we've decided what it is that
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
should replace it especially at a time
 
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
when we're allowing large-term contracts
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
to go forward which could ultimately put
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
the rate payer
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
on the hook
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
so I so that's
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
and I personally
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
feel as though the easy board is in the
 
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
midst of doing a bunch of really useful
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
work which was illustrated by the
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
wonderful presentation we had on Friday
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
from one of our members and so
 
01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
um that too is something I disagree with
 
01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:34.259 align:start position:0%
and finally I'll just say I I don't
 
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
think including
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
um HB 251's language is is useful in any
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
way no one was asking for it it will
 
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
confuse people in my opinion and it's
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
also something that the rate payers will
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
have to pay for in terms of a change on
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
the utility bill
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
and that change is not based on the
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
user's actual charges but rather an
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
aggregate mean of charges on an
 
01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
estimated Bill and so I think it just
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
confuses the issue further of what's
 
01:09:05.699 --> 01:09:06.789 align:start position:0%
confuses the issue further of what's
being

01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
charged to people in terms of renewable
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards and so I am pretty
 
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
much opposed to that bill as well so
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
that's three out of five things on there
 
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
that I
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think I could vote for
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
and that's as quick as I could say it
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
so would it be your opinion then that we
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
should none concur with the Senate
 
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be my
 
01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation I know it's not popular
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
with you know the folks that are that
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
are sending it to us from the Senate but
 
01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
that would that would be my
 
01:09:40.739 --> 01:09:42.169 align:start position:0%
that would that would be my
recommendation

01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on this issue
 
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
um and there's also the the issue of the
 
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee and I I did
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
notice that what the amendment from the
 
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
Senate does is it seems to streamline
 
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
parts of the process that's a good thing
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
but of course we did retain
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
hb609 in committee
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that if we're really
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
thinking about what we want to do about
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee we should
 
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
be looking at it
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
all together rather than piece by piece
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
so I I would rather us really look at
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
what to do with 609 and think about how
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
we should be revamping
 
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
not just the processes but possibly the
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
membership as as the bill originally uh
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
submitted did rather than just doing a
 
01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.729 align:start position:0%
submitted did rather than just doing a
piecemeal

01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
piecemeal
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
well since we retain that bill we can
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
still do that
 
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
even if House Bill 281 passes
 
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
and make some adjustments and changes to
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
the existing site evaluation committee
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
we can still use House Bill 609 to make
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
additional changes
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
if we deem them to be worthy of of
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
making so
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't preclude further work on
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
reforms to the site evaluation committee
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
and and I understand that I'm just
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
thinking it's best to look at the whole
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
thing at once together rather than piece
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
by piece but but I do agree that the
 
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
changes that the Senate has recommended
 
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
um well as the sponsor of the
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
Bill to repeal easy board I'm totally in
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
favor of the uh of that portion of of
 
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.250 align:start position:0%
favor of the uh of that portion of of
281

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:48.260 align:start position:0%
281
 
01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:52.580 align:start position:0%
I would only comment on the December
 
01:11:58.030 --> 01:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
Adder that uh will explain RPS costs uh
 
01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
when we went through that bill it was
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
made clear that there would be no
 
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
additional costs to Consumers to include
 
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.689 align:start position:0%
additional costs to Consumers to include
that

01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
um so I'm again in in favor of that uh
 
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:18.260 align:start position:0%
the improvements to the site evaluation
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh commission
 
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I uh I I favor those uh improvements
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
I also agree that maybe we can take a
 
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
broader and
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
larger examination of the in the
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
entirety of the process but uh if we
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't get there
 
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
we've at least moved forward on that on
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
that front
 
01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.530 align:start position:0%
that front
um

01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
the only thing that concerns me at all
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
in in the bill is is what they've done
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
with the municipal boundaries and what
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
that means for uh uh potential
 
01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:56.930 align:start position:0%
that means for uh uh potential
um

01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
shifting of costs to uh to rate payers
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
so in aggregate I would I would be in
 
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to thank my colleague
 
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi for bringing up
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that in the hearing we were
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
told there would be no costs for adding
 
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
that information on the December bill
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
but the bill language in fact says that
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
costs incurred will be
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
allowed to be charged back to the rate
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
payer so the bill language actually says
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
that they will be charged for those
 
01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:33.140 align:start position:0%
changes because
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know when that was included but
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding as well in the
 
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
hearing that it would not cost anything
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
but the language of the bill does not
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
state that it states that the costs will
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
be charged to the ratepayer
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
that is protective language it's fairly
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
standard language
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
in bills yes it is there you're right
 
01:13:56.689 --> 01:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
sorry there is such a
 
01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
limited attendance here this morning we
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't have a
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
a full and robust discussion of this
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
issue but
 
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
people have lives and other things they
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
have to do and jobs yeah so
 
01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
well that wraps up and concludes then
 
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
our activity for this morning I want to
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
thank everybody for being here and I
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
guess we won't see you again in
 
01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
committee until sometime in June
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas who also isn't
 
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
here because I believe he's he's in the
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
building but I believe he's with the
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
Londonderry fourth graders
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
he's try still trying to set up a a trip
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
up to the Burgess bio
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
um Power Plant and possibly the Q
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
hydrogen plant up in the north country
 
01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know how that's going he's not
 
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
here to report on it but
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
that probably will be the next time
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
we'll see each other as a committee
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
and beyond that we'll see each other in
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
reps Hall on June 8th
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
um the last question is just a
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
logistical question around the retained
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
bills and when we're going to discuss
 
01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
how how we're I don't know if you have
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
names of people for all of them or how
 
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
we're working that so that we get them
 
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
on the schedule for the fall or start
 
01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
talking about when that will happen
 
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question I'm glad
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
you brought it up I'm actually going to
 
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
spend some time this week
 
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
looking at the retained bills and trying
 
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
to decide if there are any we can
 
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
discuss before the end of June and if
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
there are I will schedule one more
 
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
committee meeting
