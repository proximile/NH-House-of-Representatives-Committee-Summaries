00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 127 and I understand there's
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment representative Shapiro did
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to that and introduce
 
00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:20.809 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to that and introduce
that

00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:22.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:27.139 align:start position:0%
sure okay I would um this is actually
 
00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's Amendment but she
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to be here today so I'm
 
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:33.419 align:start position:0%
going to introduce it
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
um I moved to adopt amendment
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
1457h to Senate bill 127.
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative lay on seconds
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro would you like to
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
um I I think that um representative
 
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:55.019 align:start position:0%
Weber spoke to this
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
um last week essentially this is a
 
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
response to representative Edwards
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
um concern query about
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
um how confusing it was about what the
 
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
initial fee shall be
 
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.630 align:start position:0%
initial fee shall be
um

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:13.700 align:start position:0%
for providers of methadone
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
detoxification and maintenance programs
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
and this clarifies
 
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
um the language and and puts into effect
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
what the actual policy as practiced
 
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
currently at DHHS is so that is the
 
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
initial fee shall be one thousand
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
dollars and that's kind of a startup fee
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
and annually thereafter the fee shall be
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
eight dollars per client based on the
 
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
client annual census of the previous
 
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
calendar year so I don't think we're
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
making any change from what's currently
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
in statute or currently is practiced but
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
it just clarifies the language
 
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you another discussion on the
 
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.710 align:start position:0%
okay thank you another discussion on the
amendment

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other discussion so I'd
 
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
ask to put the Clark quality roll the
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
movement the emotion is ought to pass on
 
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.530 align:start position:0%
movement the emotion is ought to pass on
amendment

uh representative Cannon seconds
 
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
um in terms of speaking to my motion
 
00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:52.019 align:start position:0%
um you know I think the department made
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
a compelling argument I appreciate
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
attorney Williams and his uh his array
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
of you know is uh his Entourage that he
 
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
brought that morning uh to testify on
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
the bill they gave us in my view a very
 
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.090 align:start position:0%
the bill they gave us in my view a very
comprehensive

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
um account of what the bill did what it
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
needed to do and uh many many uh updates
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of statutes and other things
 
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
and and that for that reason I'm
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
inclined to support it
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
um any other discussion
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um and I'd like
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
to thank both the sponsor and the
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
department for bringing all these
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
important factors together
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
um I do want to express my
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
disappointment that this didn't come did
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
not come across as six separate bills
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
sections one two and 16 could have been
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
one bill that would have been all on one
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
topic on substance use disorder sections
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
three and four should have been one bill
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
on Personal Care Services sections five
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
six and seven should have been one on
 
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
residential care assisted living and
 
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities sections eight and
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
nine deal with beverages entirely
 
00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
different than the rest that could have
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
been one bill so we could have better
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
understood what was happening section
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
I'll be generous and put section 10 11
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
and 12 together because it has the Mead
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
program and snap and they're all social
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
services and and it's just some basic
 
00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:14.339 align:start position:0%
revision so that would be the one two
 
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
three four fifth small Bill and then
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
there was a small cleanup one-on reports
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
I couldn't see any of those hearings
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
taking very long and those are the sort
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
of things where we could look at it and
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
say look this makes a lot of sense any
 
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
objections to moving forward with an
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
executive session right now
 
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
I greatly appreciate that this is not
 
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
The Tale of Two Cities that we had last
 
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
year but still I want to see these bills
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
come through independently and because
 
00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:43.019 align:start position:0%
of that I will be voting against this
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
not because of the content of the
 
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
individual sections but because the bet
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
I believe the best way to legislate is
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
to allow each of these topics time and
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
mind space to think about each section
 
00:13:53.579 --> 00:13:56.389 align:start position:0%
mind space to think about each section
separately

Report on that
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
party report on that okay all about the
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:34.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
moving on next stop is Senate bill 200.
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
and I believe there are a couple of
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
amendments for that uh representative
 
00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:44.150 align:start position:0%
amendments for that uh representative
paulazov

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
paulazov
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would like to move from
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2023 15 83 age
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri seconds
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative Plaza would you like to
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh yeah yes thank
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh uh I would like to speak
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh in support of amendment uh uh 20 uh
 
00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:12.019 align:start position:0%
23 15
 
00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:13.990 align:start position:0%
23 15
hs3h

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
hs3h
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh is a a cleaner version
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
of amendment that I offered uh in the
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
previous executive session and I'm
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
thankful to committee members for the
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
feedback on my previous amendments
 
00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:35.290 align:start position:0%
feedback on my previous amendments
specifically

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:35.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:38.899 align:start position:0%
I'm making sure that flu vaccines
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
stay in place because I got a feedback
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
from you that flu vaccine is a an
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
important part of a very popular popular
 
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
vaccine and also another Improvement is
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
that this amendment does not introduce
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
vaccines that were not called for by
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill and that we found out
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
the primary
 
00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:13.630 align:start position:0%
the primary
popular

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
popular
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
in administration for kids and this bill
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
uh is uh not uh dealing with that at the
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
same time this amendment uh might make
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh we are putting some
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
pause in expanding of administration of
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines because science is
 
00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:42.740 align:start position:0%
quickly evolving uh on that
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
initially without the those vaccines are
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
safe and effective and it took two years
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
to recognize the connection between
 
00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:58.460 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines and myocarditis
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
unfortunately myocarditis is a red
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
herring I mean
 
00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
uh myocarditis is only one percent of
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
severe side effects that those vaccines
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
are causing uh now last month there was
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
a recognition of connection between
 
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:24.260 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines and stroke which
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
previously was denied
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
and there are more more signals that are
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
coming along
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
those graphs that I passed to committee
 
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.529 align:start position:0%
those graphs that I passed to committee
members

00:18:38.529 --> 00:18:38.539 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
you can see that in New Hampshire there
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
are more for example minus who died
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
following covid-19 vaccines
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
administrations and following kovid
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
itself but also if we look into some New
 
00:18:58.930 --> 00:18:58.940 align:start position:0%
England populations that are
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
heavily vaccinated there are
 
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:05.900 align:start position:0%
at least a dozen of different uh
 
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
uh uh this codes that are through the
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
roof mostly related to circulation and
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
blood and while covet itself is a
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
serious disease that seasonal and might
 
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:24.980 align:start position:0%
cause uh things like
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
pneumonia this respiratory system is
 
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
being damaged at the same time we see
 
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
that covet vaccines for some reasons are
 
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
causing things with circulation for
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
example you can see a graph with a lymph
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
node cancer that was a steady
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
more or less before and it didn't pick
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
the in 2020 when there was a peak of
 
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
people dying from first wave of kovid
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
but after intellect you using of
 
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:07.820 align:start position:0%
vaccines more than 200 percent increase
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
in this from this kind of cancer and
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
many of you heard about people
 
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.409 align:start position:0%
many of you heard about people
experience

00:20:17.409 --> 00:20:17.419 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
painful symptoms after this vaccines in
 
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
their armpits where lymph nodes are
 
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
located and usually it's considered to
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
be not a big deal and it's going away
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
but as you can see in some cases it
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't and it might take months or even
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
years for it to
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
to take effect and uh in first quarter
 
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
of 2023 it's increased again more than
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
almost like 400 percent comparing to
 
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:55.700 align:start position:0%
what it was before the introduction
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
introduction of this vaccine that's why
 
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:03.380 align:start position:0%
this amendment is asked for a
 
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable pause of two years
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
with this specific Technologies so we
 
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
could investigate it and take a
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable precautions and
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that's Amendment thank you thank you
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
now the discussion representative Murphy
 
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I will vote against this amendment
 
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
for many reasons
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
um I I appreciate the concerns that
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
representative had mentioned but I would
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um say that that's his opinion and not a
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
fact that has been borne out in the
 
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.190 align:start position:0%
fact that has been borne out in the
literature

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
literature
 
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.730 align:start position:0%
literature
um

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
you have to remember that
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
the the requests from the optometrist
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%
was specifically in response to covid
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
and the pandemic and
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
during my lifetime in many of us here we
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
have lived through at least eight
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
different epidemics or pandemics and
 
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
we're certainly going to see one again
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
and therefore I think having
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
others available to give you know
 
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
vaccines shots in arms and the access
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
for the patients whether it's in the
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacy at your primary care office or
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
in the optometrist office I think is
 
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.470 align:start position:0%
in the optometrist office I think is
important

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
have to also remember that this
 
00:22:20.409 --> 00:22:20.419 align:start position:0%
messenger RNA technology is not new
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
messenger RNA was first discovered in
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
the early 60s and it's been you know
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
tested and retested and implemented and
 
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.149 align:start position:0%
tested and retested and implemented and
used

00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and probably since the early 90s the
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
nanoparticle technology was approved in
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
1995 and so this is the first true
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
application of the messenger RNA
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
technology along with the nanoparticle
 
00:22:47.289 --> 00:22:47.299 align:start position:0%
you know that was used to introduce the
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
antigen into the cells so that the T
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
cells can respond in an emir in
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
immunological response to the spike
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
proteins on the covid particle so I I
 
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
think it's it's wrong to think about
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
this as new technology messenger RNA has
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
been around a long time the work on
 
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
messenger RNA in this manner has been
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
going on for several decades
 
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.330 align:start position:0%
going on for several decades
um

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
to me to Discount the covid vaccine for
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
a group of people in response to another
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
pandemic may come along and that will
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
probably have a vaccine that uses this
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
technology is like saying I want to stay
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
with my rotary phone versus going with a
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
um uh a 10 series for my iPhone so I I
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't understand discounting the
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
technology for this purpose alone it has
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
been around a long time I think it's
 
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
been proven to be very effective and you
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
have to also remember that the FDA gave
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
its full approval to this over a year
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
ago and the FDA does continue to monitor
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
all the signs and symptoms that people
 
00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:55.700 align:start position:0%
have and in fact when the um
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh Johnson and Johnson vaccine came out
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
that was actually its authorization was
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
pulled by the FDA so they do look at the
 
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
data they respond to it and they act
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
accordingly you also have to remember
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
that over 500 million coveted vaccine
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
shots have been given worldwide in the
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
incidence of adverse reactions is de
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
minimis so for those reasons alone I
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
will have to vote against this amendment
 
00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I also will be voting
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
against the amendment I do hear the
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
concern by the representative
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
although I don't always share the
 
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
although I don't always share the
concern

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
um looking at somewhat different than
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
I'm a strong believer in standards of
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
care should be Universal we should have
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
one standard of care regardless who the
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
provider is the patient goes to
 
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
so in saying that if we're going to
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
allow all the other providers to give
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
covert vaccine and
 
00:24:59.450 --> 00:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
single out optometrist I don't think
 
00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.590 align:start position:0%
single out optometrist I don't think
it's

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
really creating a standard of care
 
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire which
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
would be my goal and number two is that
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
this is voluntary it's not mandatory so
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
therefore it's up to the patient I think
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
I really believe in patience is freedom
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
of choice and the patient should have
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
the freedom to choose if they want to to
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
get the vaccine or not and quite frankly
 
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
where they want to get it whether it's
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
an optometrist a pharmacy or a
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
physician's office nurse practitioner so
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
for those reasons I would be voting
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
against the amendment
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
thank you other discussion
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo I'd like to react
 
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:35.830 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo I'd like to react
and

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murphy uh to
 
00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
pointing out this that this is a
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
specific request and relation to covet
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic so let's imagine a best case
 
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:53.900 align:start position:0%
scenario that
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
something like this bill would be in
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
place an optometrist would be using
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
their Workforce and their good
 
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.409 align:start position:0%
their Workforce and their good
reputation

00:26:02.409 --> 00:26:02.419 align:start position:0%
reputation
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
to overcome vaccine hesitancy in New
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and deliver this shorts into
 
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
the veins of as many New Hampshire
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
residences it would be another New
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
England communities so how many
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
infections would be stopped and how many
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
lives would be saved and my point is
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't stop an infection so
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
infection would be wouldn't be stopped
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
and from the data that we are seeing uh
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
I would argue that a couple of hundred
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
more New Hampshire people would die from
 
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:48.419 align:start position:0%
a side effect and we are here inside the
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
facts a minimal we're healing it's just
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
a few per million but every member of
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
this committee knows that side effects
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
are underreported and also
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
just uh in in one of the political
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
caucuses in this committee a little bit
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
over a dozen people well vaccinated uh
 
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:15.740 align:start position:0%
to people publicly came out as having
 
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
severe side effects from this vaccine so
 
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's for me it's not one a few per
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
million it's a few per dozen so side
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
effects and death from side effects are
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
severely under reported and that's why I
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh audio uh question and another
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
argument we heard last week that it's uh
 
00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:45.740 align:start position:0%
there was some Under reporting some
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
some concealment of information from
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
people but it's a free choice I mean
 
00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:54.419 align:start position:0%
it's it's a free choice if we all go to
 
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
our constituency and we will tell them
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
that side effects are severely under
 
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
reported and that we know that like
 
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
several members or substitutes and this
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
committees had severe side effects of it
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
but it's not happening when optometrists
 
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
will be injecting these vaccines to
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
people they wouldn't be sharing the
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
information that this committee knows so
 
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
that's why I don't see it as a just a
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
free market approach because information
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
is hidden from people thank you
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bill King did
 
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
you still want to speak no okay any
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none I'll ask that the
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
clerkalo motion is ought to pass on
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%

calendar
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
oh what's that you wanna that was the
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
amendment sure is it going to be a
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
minority wait are you doing a minority
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
on that uh oh that's right I'm sorry I'm
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
sorry okay so the amendment fails um
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I believe you
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
have another amendment I do Mr chair
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
um it's the same one I think I sent out
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
to everybody electronically but just in
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
case people don't have it I've made
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
copies as well
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
so make a sentence this way
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
and I'll put some out in the audience
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:34.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.289 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:39.539 align:start position:0%
okay representative Merchant thank you
 
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
so as I said earlier on the other
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that was proposed actually do
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have a motion no motion short thank
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
you I'll make a motion to
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
um pass house bill
 
00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:52.870 align:start position:0%
um pass house bill
2023

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
-1568h is there a second
 
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Shapiro seconds
 
00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to speak to your
 
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
motion representative Merchant
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned before I'm a strong
 
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:09.260 align:start position:0%
believer in having a standard of care
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
across all disciplines
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
um dealing with consistency for the
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
patient's sake and I worked with
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman on this as well
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
she brought it up during the hearing
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
that the requirements for a an
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
optometrist to give the vaccine
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
is somewhat different than the
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
requirements for the pharmacist to get
 
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
the vaccine so what we did collectively
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
was go back and look at the RSA for the
 
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and basically at that point
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
in time take the same requirements that
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
they are required to have and insert
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
those requirements into this statute
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
and the requirements are
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
they hold a current license to practice
 
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
which is understandable they complete
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
the training course they have a million
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
dollars in liability insurance a waiver
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
for this specifically
 
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
they hold it active certification of
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
pulmonary cardio basic cardiopulmonary
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
resuscitation and they provide to the
 
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
board of Optometry
 
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
the documentation they have all of this
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
in place before they're actually
 
00:33:07.679 --> 00:33:09.169 align:start position:0%
in place before they're actually
condemnonized

00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
condemnonized
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a logical thing to do is
 
00:33:13.009 --> 00:33:13.019 align:start position:0%
that if you want to protect the patient
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
because you want training
 
00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
if something does go wrong it does you
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that there's liability
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
insurance to cover the event if it does
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
and you also want to be sure that
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
they're providing some sort of oversight
 
00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:28.019 align:start position:0%
board in this case the board of
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
Optometry that they have in fact met all
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
those requirements before they can
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
actually get the immunization so that's
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm bringing this forth to
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
um so that's my my comments thank you of
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
 
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.149 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
Nagel

00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
Nagel
 
00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:51.350 align:start position:0%
Nagel
um

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not that familiar with Optometry but
 
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
a million dollars is a lot of liability
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
insurance why was that number picked I'm
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
why yeah because it's a time in which
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
the RSA when was going through the
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
legislative body that's what was great
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
too thanks
 
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy did you have your
 
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
hand up yeah thank you um uh just a
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
question to representative Merchant and
 
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
I I did put this in an email to him
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
because I just wanted to get the answer
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
you mentioned using diphenhydramine as
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
well as epinephrine and equivalent
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
medications would given that the
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
patients that have any anaphylaxis
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
reaction also have pulmonary issues you
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
know and are treated sometimes with
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
oxygen or in the hill like albuterol
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
would it be better in your mind to have
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
something more Broad in its terminology
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
like medical management and Pulmonary
 
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
support as
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
there's a good question representative
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
Murphy I wrestled with that because
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
in one sense yes it would but in the
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
other sense no because when you get to
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
that level of care
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
I think the training you need is going
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
to be beyond what they're going to
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
receive in the training of giving the
 
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
shots if to give an epinephrine
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
injection is one thing start giving the
 
00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:07.460 align:start position:0%
patient albuterol
 
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
oxygen and so forth It's probably time
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
to call the EMT
 
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
my follow-up I would agree and I
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate the response I was just
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
thinking before the EMTs get there would
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
they be better off serve to have oxygen
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
available in any other medications as
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
per CPR protocol that's all thank you
 
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980 align:start position:0%

a motion about to pass as amended make a
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
motion not the passes amended okay is
 
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer seconds any
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
seeing representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.630 align:start position:0%
seeing representative Leon thank you Mr
chairman

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I I do want to thank representative
 
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
Murphy for his point about the potential
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
dangers that can happen once you start
 
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
and start having these these different
 
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.030 align:start position:0%
and start having these these different
issues

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
um I know that there there's the medical
 
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
Freedom side of the argument here saying
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
that as long as you have the adequate
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
training it makes sense to be able to
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
provide these vaccines there's the
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
question too about how that impacts the
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of different practices
 
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.630 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of different practices
so

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
um I I see that there can be multiple
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
viewpoints on this about how much of a
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
net positive it is I know that I'll be
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
supporting this but I'm not sure you
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
know that's one of these where it needs
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
to be left up to our individual
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
conscience to see if we think that the
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
benefits outweigh the risks
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh I'm really thankful for amendments
 
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
that uh is passed but I still will be
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
voting against this bill I think that
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
optometrists need to be focused uh on
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
the care of their patients eyes instead
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
of doing vaccines and vaccines will be a
 
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
distraction for the main function uh
 
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
optometrists typically do not listen to
 
00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:20.060 align:start position:0%
patients had they typically do not take
 
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:23.060 align:start position:0%
patients blood pressure
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
and they typically do not have a handle
 
00:38:30.849 --> 00:38:30.859 align:start position:0%
of the patient's full medical history
 
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
optometrists will be opening themselves
 
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:36.500 align:start position:0%
to liability with this new
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that they will have and
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
I I believe that there's no issues like
 
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:46.940 align:start position:0%
we don't see like a line of people
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
asking abdominal lists and seeking for
 
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.790 align:start position:0%
asking abdominal lists and seeking for
vaccines

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
so for this reasons I think it's not
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
needed and it's opening for
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
dangerous situations especially that it
 
00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:07.910 align:start position:0%
dangerous situations especially that it
touches

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
such I believe harmful medications as
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
thank you another discussion
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I I also will not
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
be supporting this bill overall even
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
though the um the amendment was a was a
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
good attempt uh unfortunately there's
 
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:35.660 align:start position:0%
more of um uh looking out for the small
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
optometrists they have big concerns
 
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
about this and so I'm just looking out
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
for the the little guys that's my that's
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
so ignore the discussion I'll ask the
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
clear call the wall the motion is ought
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
to pass is amended on SB 200.

failed or like uh
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%

okay Mr chair I'll write the majority
 
00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:52.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I might recommend that if
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
you support you since you supported the
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment as well to have a
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
separate Amendment drafted that includes
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
both the committee and that I'm not sure
 
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
what the right procedure would be but
 
00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
let's I just want to make sure we don't
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
accidentally get rid of those important
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
changes so we'll get guidance to figure
 
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%

00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure who wants to go first
 
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:36.900 align:start position:0%

00:42:58.079 --> 00:43:02.770 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna do it wrong um I want to move
Amendment

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:02.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
2023-1581h on
 
00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:09.020 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 239 for consideration
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative Leon seconds would you
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative Google
 
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.750 align:start position:0%
representative Google
um

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:20.099 align:start position:0%
one of the local TV stations yesterday
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
unwittingly made my case for this motion
 
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.410 align:start position:0%
unwittingly made my case for this motion
yesterday

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
um my concern about this bill has been
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
the rights of people in pain and and
 
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
that they not become stigmatized and
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
harmed by this kind of Bill the
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
terminology that was being asked to
 
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.430 align:start position:0%
terminology that was being asked to
change

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
um I thought put them at risk and
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday on um
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
the television station when they were
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:46.790 align:start position:0%
talking about
um

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
um the opioid crisis they just showed
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
spill bottles of pills as their example
 
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
and that bothers me a lot so I thought
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
that this became even more important
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
because that stigmatized our patients
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
um what we did on it's on page one
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
um under 12j-1
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
um it adds the following language
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
um that nothing in rsa12j should be
 
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
construed to limit care of chronic pain
 
00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:15.020 align:start position:0%
and hospice and palliative care patients
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
including the term misuse which shall be
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
utilized as independent to broaden the
 
00:44:22.569 --> 00:44:22.579 align:start position:0%
scope of work across the substance use
 
00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:24.740 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
my purpose in this amendment was to
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel for bringing this
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
very important amendment I think that
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely crucial that when
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
somebody is fighting for their life we
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
provide them the appropriate tools for
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
pain management and worry about
 
00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:51.020 align:start position:0%
addiction after we save their life first
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
and also when you're in that much pain
 
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
addictions a lot less of an option a lot
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
less likely than when you are in a
 
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
different scenario so um this has my
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:05.460 align:start position:0%

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.829 align:start position:0%

00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
I worked for three years at a hospice
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
house and I remember seeing patients
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
coming in in tremendous pain because
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
their primary care doctor or cancer
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
doctors were afraid to give them like
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
enough medication and once you're in
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
hospice I think you know a good hospice
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
they palliate palliate their pain and I
 
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
would see these same patients who had
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
come in on a gurney like awful
 
00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:35.339 align:start position:0%
three days later they're playing cards
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
in the living room
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's so important that um
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
the fear of addiction is inappropriate
 
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
in a hospice setting and that it's so
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
wonderful When people's pain can be
 
00:45:48.599 --> 00:45:49.790 align:start position:0%
wonderful When people's pain can be
palliated

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
palliated
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's Humane so thank you
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative land thank you Mr
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that I will actually
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
expand a little bit on this um the
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
palliative care also isn't necessarily
 
00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:03.140 align:start position:0%
end of life
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
if I can talk to a personal reason why
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm supporting this my mother-in-law
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
developed a bed sore and she had one
 
00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
that was grapefruit sized and when she
 
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
was sent to a hospital for wound care
 
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
and pain treatment she was given
 
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.450 align:start position:0%
and pain treatment she was given
Tramadol

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
Tramadol
 
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
pretty much all of our last words were
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
ten ten ten for pain because they
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
refused to get a consult in order to
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually appropriately manage her pain
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
and by not managing that pain her body
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
was so busy dealing with that pain it
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
was unable to fight off the infection
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
and the assault on her bodily Integrity
 
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
had she had pain management she still
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
might not have survived but she would
 
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:41.579 align:start position:0%
have had a Fighting Chance when she got
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
transferred to another hospital that
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
actually took pain as a Vital sign and
 
00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
took pain as an important thing
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
she relaxed and she finally knew that
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
she was getting help if this amendment
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
if this it has one small part to keep
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
other people from going through that
 
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
torture while trying to fight for their
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
lives then we've done good things this
 
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.430 align:start position:0%
lives then we've done good things this
year

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you that was wonderful
 
00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
um I also want to expand this discussion
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
just to say that for the record and
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
again I was very concerned and upset
 
00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
about the public portrayal of the
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
patients I represent on a local
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
television station yesterday but roughly
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
66 million people in the United States
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
suffer from chronic pain 20 million have
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
what we call high impact chronic pain we
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
estimate 15 million of those people who
 
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
do not benefit from other therapies can
 
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
benefit from long-term opioid therapy
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
and the public policy response to the
 
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis which addresses fewer than
 
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
2 million people with opioid use
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
disorders sixty percent of whom had a
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
prior substance used as sort of the
 
00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
predated their opioid use disorder
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
is basically served to harm them
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
creating a public policy or Public
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
Health crisis that we refer to as opioid
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
refugees who are not getting care that
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
they need getting denied access to
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
treatment that had worked and resulting
 
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
in unnecessary suicide unnecessary going
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
to the street to treat their own
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
medication or suffering needlessly and I
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
think that there needs need to be
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
recognized too and that was the other
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
reason that this was important
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
another discussion representative
 
00:48:20.819 --> 00:48:22.309 align:start position:0%
another discussion representative
Merchant

00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
it's more Uncommon I wanted to thank
 
00:48:26.329 --> 00:48:26.339 align:start position:0%
Crimson Nagel
 
00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
one of the things that caught my
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
attention was the fact on line four and
 
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.130 align:start position:0%
attention was the fact on line four and
five

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
is the word Other Drug which basically
 
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
implies alcohol itself is a drug
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to say thank you for that
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
and recognizing that we have alcohol as
 
00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
a drug and not looking at it as a
 
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.750 align:start position:0%
a drug and not looking at it as a
non-drug

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
non-drug
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%

sure
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
um if one turns to page five on the bill
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom on line 25 under
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
continuing medical education
 
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.089 align:start position:0%
continuing medical education
um

00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:56.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
um Senator Waters and I actually worked
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
on this together he had listed
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
um a recommendation
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
um for doctors
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
um for CME for basically uh substance
 
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:07.790 align:start position:0%
um for CME for basically uh substance
use

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
um I had pointed out to him that that
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually already existed in
 
00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:14.099 align:start position:0%
um in medical rules so all we did was we
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
struck his language and we put the
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
existing language
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
um from uh the boredom at uh yeah the
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
board of medicine's rules which
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
basically says all licensees are
 
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
required to register with the all
 
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
licensees required to register with a
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
controlled drug prescription health and
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
safety program shall complete three
 
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:35.339 align:start position:0%
credit hours of approved online uh
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
continuing education or pass an online
 
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
examination in the area of pain
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
management or addiction disorders
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
um that is actually more stringent
 
00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:47.099 align:start position:0%
requirement than what he had written um
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
I should add one more thing
 
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
um the average doctor gets um in his
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
training or her training seven hours of
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
training and Pain Management the average
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
veterinarian actually gets substantially
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
more than that um the average doctor
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
gets very little if any training and
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
addiction medicine so I don't know about
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
veterinarians on addiction but anyways
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
um we we do believe that that's a huge
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
hole in medical education and this is a
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
way to um to fill that hole and that's
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
why that language was uncertain in the
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
state rules sure representative Shapiro
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
and then representative Merchant
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you for bringing this amendment
 
00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:33.730 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious
 
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:34.010 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious
[Music]

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.670 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
why it doesn't say and addiction
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
disorders as opposed to oral addiction
 
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:47.210 align:start position:0%
disorders as opposed to oral addiction
disorders

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the way it's listed right now is a
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
doctor can use that three hours for
 
00:52:51.119 --> 00:52:52.069 align:start position:0%
doctor can use that three hours for
either

00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
so in other words like each it has to be
 
00:52:56.809 --> 00:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
done every two year cycle so one cycle I
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
can do one the reality is is pretty much
 
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
every exercise we do includes both
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and
 
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr chair
 
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
and also thank you representative Nagel
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
for bringing us forth
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
it's more of a procedural issue the way
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
this is written
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to someone else who's more
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
involved with the process here this is
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the RSA governing Physicians and
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
surgeons So when you say all licensees I
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
think I know what's implied
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
however because it's in the RSA chapter
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
for Physicians and surgeons it's only
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
for those who are licensed by the Board
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
of Medicine it would not include people
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
from the board of dentistry people from
 
00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:42.740 align:start position:0%
the board of
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
natural past people from the boards at
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
the board so I just want to bring that
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
to people's attention to someone to
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that to me to be helpful
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
that is a really important point and I
 
00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
spent about two hours last night at a
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant scrolling through every rule
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to figure this out so
 
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.309 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to figure this out so
um

00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
and I think that's an important thing
 
00:54:05.569 --> 00:54:05.579 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be included it turns out
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
that dentists actually have in their
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
rules they do have pretty much the same
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
language doctors do
 
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.049 align:start position:0%
language doctors do
um

00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
um for their requirement
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
um so it's in rules now
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
um I I actually can my wife's an MP so
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
we talked about this last night I
 
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
there's no place in the NP rules that
 
00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
actually specifies that they need to do
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
this however so I asked I know she has
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
to get three hours so I asked where does
 
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
that come from she said it's from the
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
DEA registration requires that you do
 
00:54:33.119 --> 00:54:33.950 align:start position:0%
DEA registration requires that you do
that

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:36.049 --> 00:54:36.059 align:start position:0%
that I didn't have time to look into but
 
00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:38.099 align:start position:0%
they're important things that should be
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
added at some point I'm not totally sure
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
if this is the right place to do that
 
00:54:44.329 --> 00:54:44.339 align:start position:0%
um but I think we have a lot of work
 
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
with those boards to make sure those
 
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
things are addressed
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
the follow-up just for clarity so you're
 
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
through this amendment looking strictly
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
at Physicians and surgeons and PAs this
 
00:54:56.089 --> 00:54:56.099 align:start position:0%
would not include nurse practitioners
 
00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
dentists in Southworth I'm not sure it
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
includes Pas either for that matter it's
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
it is an important addition and we
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
certainly could work on that if you want
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
I think it's a it's important addition
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I and maybe this
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
was answered by representative Nagel but
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to clarify why we need the
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
language in the first place
 
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.770 align:start position:0%
language in the first place
um

00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:17.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
as we all as you know we obviously have
 
00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:22.490 align:start position:0%
as we all as you know we obviously have
to

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
um have three hours of
 
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh CME credits um every two years you
 
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
have to get your license renewed you
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
have to have a hundred hours of CME
 
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
credits 40 of which have to be category
 
00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:35.819 align:start position:0%
one and of that forty three have to be
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
for pain management in addiction so we
 
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
already have that in statue in fact the
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
statue is RSA 318-b colon 40. so one of
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
my questions was why do we need to have
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
that language into this step into this
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
bill right now
 
00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and also in response to your comment
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
about you know how many hours uh the
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
Vets have to have versus The Physicians
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
the DEA just came out with a new
 
00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:01.930 align:start position:0%
the DEA just came out with a new
one-time

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:01.940 align:start position:0%
one-time
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
ruling that all Physicians have to have
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
a one-time eight-hour course in
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
addiction and pain control so that was
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
effective as of December of last year so
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question was the need for
 
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
having this language if it's already
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
written in Statue elsewhere
 
00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
I'll look through this statute again I
 
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware it existed in statute just
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
in rules I I be honest with you I had
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
really mixed feelings about this being
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
in statute because it is clearly in
 
00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
rules and it's in rules for all three
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
boards right now right yeah I mean is it
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary that's the way it
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
was brought to us and I'm not sure I can
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
make a convincing argument for that
 
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
on the discussion your representative
 
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:46.940 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative representative Murphy um
 
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
the DEA requirement that's strictly for
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
Physicians or anyone who has the ability
 
00:56:55.849 --> 00:56:55.859 align:start position:0%
to write a prescription for an opiate I
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
believe it's for anybody that can write
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
for um uh the medication
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and it's three hours
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
um out of the 40 CME credits or category
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
one but like I said there there's a new
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
um uh stat new rule that came out
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
through the DEA as of December of this
 
00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
past year that requires a one-time
 
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
eight-hour course in opioid in pain
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
management and again that's for all
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
providers yes I believe so
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel yeah that's a
 
00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:26.339 align:start position:0%
really important point and the other
 
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
thing we always have to remember too is
 
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
that criteria that if you're registered
 
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
with the Dei you need to do that if
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
you're not registered with a DEA like
 
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
some nurse practitioners are not
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
the minute you put this in statute then
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
all of them have to do it even if they
 
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
don't provide any addiction or pain
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
services so that probably doesn't make
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
any sense so that's why my wife said
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
that that was not unnecessary for NPS
 
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask Clark to call the
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
roll uh the motion is ought to pass on
 
00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.030 align:start position:0%
roll uh the motion is ought to pass on
Amendment

okay
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh by the way we need a second we need
 
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
to find out who made the second on the
 
00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
First Amendment
 
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
first on I'd be on the second on that
 
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
one okay thank you I have another one
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative Nagel still has some
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:54.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
so just for the record I had never done
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
an amendment before today so I'm kind of
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
making up making up a lost time yeah
 
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.849 align:start position:0%
making up making up a lost time yeah
exactly

01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
um so this is I would like to move
 
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.390 align:start position:0%
um so this is I would like to move
um Amendment

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
um Amendment
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
2023-161 h on Senate Bill 239 sorry what
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
second representative Merchant seconds
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
um you may speak to your motion so when
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
this again getting back to what I said
 
01:00:42.049 --> 01:00:42.059 align:start position:0%
with the First Amendment one of my big
 
01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill was that there
 
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
were a lot of terms being used that were
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
not being defined
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
um and so I looked through statutes and
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
found out that none of them were defined
 
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
in statute either so we kind of felt a
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
number of us that these holes needed to
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
be filled so there were
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
um basically misuse was used to
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
substitute for the word um abuse and
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
what I found interesting about that word
 
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
was that it was extremely hard to find a
 
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
definition of what that actually meant
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
um and I looked at Nida I looked at
 
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
samhsa I looked everywhere so um there's
 
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
a clear definition for that as it
 
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
applies to prescription drugs but not to
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
drugs in general so if we were going to
 
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
use that broad change I thought that
 
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
that really needed to be defined the
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
other term of importance was harm
 
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.370 align:start position:0%
other term of importance was harm
reduction

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
um that we there is a pretty pretty good
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
overview of that in the governor's
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
commission report on Alcohol and Other
 
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.430 align:start position:0%
commission report on Alcohol and Other
Drugs

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
Drugs
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
um and if anybody is wants to can refer
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
to that but um we basically did for that
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
and this is the Senators Edition
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
um Senator waters on um
 
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
he took the definition from samhsa which
 
01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:58.140 align:start position:0%
is fairly consistent with what the
 
01:01:59.569 --> 01:01:59.579 align:start position:0%
governor said and the reason why all
 
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
these are important again is that is the
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement Commission and the
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
governor's commission start to work
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
better together which we think is really
 
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
important it would be really helpful to
 
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
have nomenclature that's that we can use
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
consistent consistently with each other
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
the other issue is that harm reduction
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
is becoming a bigger and bigger issue
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
and um and in Senator rosenwald's
 
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
earlier bill that we saw that was a big
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
part of that bill so we really needed to
 
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
find what we were talking about
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
um with that as a background
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
um I chose to look at prescription drugs
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
and this is going to be an addendum at
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
the end of the bill so it's not
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
replacing any language
 
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.910 align:start position:0%
replacing any language
um

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
um there were two things there was
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
misuse of prescription drugs and I'm I'm
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry I know she did include
 
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
both so the first thing was Miss I I
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
separated drug misuse and misuse of
 
01:02:59.329 --> 01:02:59.339 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs misuse of
 
01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs is a well-defined
 
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
thing in samhsa's night is
 
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
um uh criteria means taking a medicine
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
in a medication and manner or dose other
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
than prescribed it's a very broad topic
 
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
abuse is a very minor or small part of
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
that for example if I'm prescribed one
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
Percocet every four hours and I take it
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
one every two hours and that would be
 
01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
classified as misuse
 
01:03:33.049 --> 01:03:33.059 align:start position:0%
if I shoot up heroin or that oxycodone
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
um that's why the difference is
 
01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:42.059 align:start position:0%
important drug misuse is a separate
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
thing that we worked on together again
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
looking at samsa Nida background drug
 
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
misuse refers to the use of a substance
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
for a purpose that is not consistent
 
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:53.339 align:start position:0%
with legal or medical guidelines
 
01:03:53.339 --> 01:03:53.930 align:start position:0%
with legal or medical guidelines
um

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
the other one was harm reduction and
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's in section five
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
really basically this is very similar to
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
the governor's definition it's harm
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
reduction shall mean an approach that
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
emphasized engaging directly with people
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
who already used
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
drugs to prevent overdose and infectious
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
disease Transmissions improve the
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
physical mental and social well-being of
 
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
those served offering low threshold
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
options for accessing substance use
 
01:04:24.849 --> 01:04:24.859 align:start position:0%
disorder and other health care services
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
and promoting a philosophy of Hope and
 
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
healing by utilizing those with lived
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
experience of recovery in the management
 
01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
of harm reduction
 
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
stigmatization was an important issue
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's not mentioned right in that it's
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
implied in those the governor's overview
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
if I can do that there's one two three
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
four five six points to it the first one
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
is do we enhance harm capacity of harm
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
reduction programs ensure the
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
availability of opioid reversal
 
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
education naloxone things like that and
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
availability expand access to drug
 
01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:00.020 align:start position:0%
checking Services throughout the state
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
expand the utilization of harm reduction
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
strategies through Street Outreach
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
drop-in centers peer support services
 
01:05:09.849 --> 01:05:09.859 align:start position:0%
critical time intervention programs
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
develop and implement strategies to
 
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
reduce the stigma again regarding harm
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
reduction services
 
01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of patients that are
 
01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:20.579 align:start position:0%
stigmatized on methadone that's another
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
long story expand engagement of Health
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
Care Providers and this is where the
 
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
education comes and expand engagement of
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers and health systems
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
and providing harm reduction education
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
materials and services
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
the discussion yes it's not
 
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:42.380 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me need some water yeah um thank
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you very much uh my
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
question is representative Nagel I agree
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
with all the wording that is in your
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment my question is whether it's
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
simply broad enough
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
um and regardless of the governor's
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
commission you know definition of not if
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
we put into statute a harm reduction
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
definition and it's too narrow does that
 
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope of potential you know
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
um modalities of treatment down the road
 
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
um would it be better in your mind to
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
Simply refer harm reduction to the samsa
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
definition for those not familiar with
 
01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
Samsung is um Substance Abuse and Mental
 
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
Health Services Administration that was
 
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
actually established by the department
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
of U.S department of HHS in 1990
 
01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:34.849 align:start position:0%
of U.S department of HHS in 1990
something

01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
um but they have in their website a very
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
broad definition including things like
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
education condom use a the testing and
 
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and so my question is
 
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
would we be better served having a
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
reference to the samsa definition so
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
that it includes all the various you
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
know treatment modalities in education
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
that goes along with it
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
no I agree I I I personally think
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
broader is better
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion
 
01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:09.380 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you reps of Nagel thank you for
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.109 align:start position:0%
the amendment
um

01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
on line six
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
you talk about misuse of prescription
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
drugs however we go back and look at the
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
amendment we first passed
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug misuse
 
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
so my concern is that we're
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
sort of have a conflict between the two
 
01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.349 align:start position:0%
sort of have a conflict between the two
definitions

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
um and what I'm trying to get to is that
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
you could have misuse of alcohol as well
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
as drugs so it doesn't always have to be
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
a prescription drug per se could be
 
01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
something that's an alcohol with it so
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
it also means taking a medication versus
 
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
using a drug so I'm just concerned that
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
this definition conflicts with the other
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
one we just passed so that's a really
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
important point and I'm not happy seeing
 
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
how this was written up because it's not
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
the way I presented it the way it was
 
01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
presented is those were two separate
 
01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.630 align:start position:0%
presented is those were two separate
definitions

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
um in other words I agree totally with
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
everything you just said that drug use
 
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
of substances is a separate issue from
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
drug use of prescription drugs and
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
they're separate definitions and they
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
were intended to be that way in what
 
01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:17.900 align:start position:0%
this amendment was should we yeah
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
go ahead sure go ahead would you be
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
amenable to sending something down to
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
OLS and try to get this changed as
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible thank you sorry was
 
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
one of them last night just saw for the
 
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:34.259 align:start position:0%
representative plazov
 
01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:38.420 align:start position:0%
so I have a comment and question a
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
comments that uh I don't see a problem
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
with previous Amendment because if
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
previously we defined this Alcohol and
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs it means that alcohol is
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
also drugs so I think there's no
 
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
conflict here
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
the issue is the word prescription
 
01:08:58.610 --> 01:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
you don't need a prescription for
 
01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.110 align:start position:0%
you don't need a prescription for
alcohol

01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the conflict I think
 
01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:05.090 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the conflict I think
arises

01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
and uh go ahead so my follow-up question
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
somebody or opposite of the first
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
question that my concern
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
would be if this definition is too broad
 
01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:25.940 align:start position:0%
it can open uh
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
provide this to new liabilities and open
 
01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:32.179 align:start position:0%
us to new expenses
 
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
so I wonder what committee members think
 
01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:36.669 align:start position:0%
so I wonder what committee members think
about

01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
if the definitions which I I see quite
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
broad like home reduction like uh
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
um it includes several broad topics here
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
uh so my question would be uh with this
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
definitions that are still pretty Broad
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
do you see uh it opening us to new
 
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
liabilities opening providers to new
 
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
liabilities opening state to new
 
01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:10.610 align:start position:0%
liabilities opening state to new
expenditures

01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
I don't personally see a liability issue
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
I I maybe can you ask that question
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
again I'm going to make sure I
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
understand it better
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed a lot of what you
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
said in the beginning go ahead
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
the question uh
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
as uh competit to not having definitions
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
and underlying bills and by broadening
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
providers and the state for new
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
expenditure just to try to address
 
01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:01.460 align:start position:0%
those brought the definitions of
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
the drug misuse of hand reductions so
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as misuse of drugs those are
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
very well defined things and the real
 
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
the reason I was concerned
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
was that some abuse is basically called
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
self-medication and we need to be really
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
careful about how we we Define what
 
01:11:24.169 --> 01:11:24.179 align:start position:0%
we're talking about so for example
 
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
um people like to quote 12 million
 
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
incidences of um of opioid or I think
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's opioid misuse a year that is an
 
01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
incredibly deceptive number when one
 
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
considers 70 of those are actually
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
people self-medicating like for example
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
you know we hear this every day a
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
patient gets a prescription for Tylenol
 
01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
with codeine or Vicodin or something for
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
procedure they leave it in their case
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
they get severe pain their doctor won't
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
see them for three months they're in
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
agony and they say fine I'm going to
 
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
take that because I got it
 
01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
that's called common sense to me
 
01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
personally um but but that's
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
characterized as misuse so by by
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
defining these things better and we have
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
a clear abuse a definition of abuse
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's already in statute we don't have
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
a definition of misuse and I thought
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
that it was important that that actually
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
be defined the reason why you separate
 
01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.090 align:start position:0%
be defined the reason why you separate
um

01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
um prescription drugs from
 
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
non-prescription drugs is that and I
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
thought that this was also important is
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
because misuse of a non-prescription
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
drugs very different like for example
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
now cannabis is a is a non-prescription
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
drug um and most people that are using
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
are actually self-medicating but it's a
 
01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
totally different concept so I thought
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
it was important to bring those things
 
01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
to light rather than just throw this
 
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
term misuse that can be used for almost
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
anything and that was my concern as they
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
said well this is best practice and I
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
said well what does it actually mean so
 
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
we tried to figure out what they meant
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
by best practice rather than just
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
leaving some nebulous term out there as
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
far as harm reduction is concerned
 
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
um I've done a lot of work with samhsa
 
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
over the last 15 years they're really
 
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
smart people I trust they've been
 
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
working on these issues for a very long
 
01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
period of time if you look at the
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
governor's oversight or Governor's
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
program that they've developed it's
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
pretty much straight from samhsa
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines so I mean that I I think that
 
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.470 align:start position:0%
guidelines so I mean that I I think that
that

01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of trust involved
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
in here but I think I trust them to
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
Define what the term means
 
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.110 align:start position:0%
Define what the term means
um

01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:29.060 align:start position:0%
anyways I'll leave it at that
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative profile
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman so just uh two
 
01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
two comments one regarding the the
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
broadness or narrowness of the
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
definition of of harm reduction uh my
 
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
concern with the original bill is that
 
01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
the the definition essentially doesn't
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
exist so it's so broad you could drive a
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
truck through it
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
um for what it's worth I think that the
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
the definition of harm reduction offered
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
here is still too broad
 
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to have different
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
opinions on that sometimes if uh if if
 
01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
some are against it and some are for it
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
you then you probably hit the mark
 
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.010 align:start position:0%
um the the
um

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
the other comment I'll make is has to do
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
with references to external
 
01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.890 align:start position:0%
with references to external
organizations

01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm opposed to them
 
01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:17.149 align:start position:0%
um I'm opposed to them
um

01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
we do this a lot in statute and in rules
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we are referencing what some other
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
body says determines uh puts out as a
 
01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.250 align:start position:0%
body says determines uh puts out as a
statement

01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.209 align:start position:0%
statement
um

01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
and those things can change so when
 
01:14:34.689 --> 01:14:34.699 align:start position:0%
those things change our laws change
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
without the people's Representatives
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
having a single thing to say about it so
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
um without speaking to
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not we should trust
 
01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
samhsa they sound like a good
 
01:14:50.209 --> 01:14:50.219 align:start position:0%
organization I would vigorously oppose
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
anything that that included an external
 
01:14:55.729 --> 01:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
reference and sort of left to someone
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
else to to
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
create that definition and uh
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
potentially change it down the road
 
01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
did you want to respond yeah I really
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate it representative Shapiro I
 
01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
totally appreciate that and um that's
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
why I didn't just accept the samhsa
 
01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
definition because that's what was
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
provided to me
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
um I tried to look through
 
01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
again this is an issue of best practices
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
in the field so what I tried to do is
 
01:15:23.689 --> 01:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
look through as many sites of of
 
01:15:27.169 --> 01:15:27.179 align:start position:0%
organizations and other states what do
 
01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
people are saying to try to come up with
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
a definition and I think your earliest
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
comment made the most sense is that it's
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
a pretty nebulous comment concept to
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
Define so
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that representative Shapiro
 
01:15:44.689 --> 01:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
I just got a message that the Department
 
01:15:46.729 --> 01:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services would like
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
to chime in on this issue that they have
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
some concerns okay
 
01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.330 align:start position:0%
some concerns okay
um

01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
see if I could provide any Clarity in
 
01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
this um these definitions at all so one
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
of the the pieces this is kind of a
 
01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:15.179 align:start position:0%
situation where the language is catching
 
01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
up to the best practice in the field so
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
as representative Nagel had talked about
 
01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
the definition of misuse really is
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
around prescription misuse and so as you
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
dig into what does that misuse mean it
 
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
is broader and and really speaks to
 
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
alcohol and tobacco and Other Drugs
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
right and so we're trying to get to a
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
place where it's comprehensive where we
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
can both research and fund the full
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care including prevention
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
right and get Upstream from these issues
 
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
and so that's the purpose and intent of
 
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
the language change as well as the piece
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
I spoke about in my testimony and our
 
01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
I spoke about in my testimony and our
hearing

01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
um of the word abuse having some
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
negative connotation and continuing to
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
perpetuate stigma and so that's the
 
01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:00.659 align:start position:0%
purpose of using of using misuse the
 
01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
definition in the second line of the
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that says drug misuse refers
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
to the use of a substance for a purpose
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
best that's not consistent with legal or
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
medical guidelines I believe covers the
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
misuse of prescription drugs because
 
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
that would be outside of medical
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
guidelines so then that may keep it
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
broad enough to not have that first to
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
not have that first sentence which I
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
think is covered by the second the other
 
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
thing that you could do is that
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
substance use broadly is well defined
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
already and refers to the use of
 
01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:33.620 align:start position:0%
selected substances including alcohol
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
tobacco products drugs inhalants and
 
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
other substances that could be consumed
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
um with possible dependence or
 
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
detrimental effects that's the substance
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
use definition and you could go that
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
direction and use a well-defined sort of
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
definition that keeps it broad moves
 
01:17:51.169 --> 01:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
away from the stigmatizing language so
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
it still has the same intent
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative co-falt and
 
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:17:58.850 --> 01:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so uh one other
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
comment I wanted to make was uh with
 
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
respect to representative Murphy's
 
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
statement about concerns that a narrow
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
death a too narrow definition of harm
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
reduction would
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
close off the path to certain treatment
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that came up in
 
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
the hearing because I asked specifically
 
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
about Methadone in my research
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
I had seen methadone
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
classified in some by some medical
 
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
experts as
 
01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
harm reduction and so I asked about it
 
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
and the answer we heard
 
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
from the witness was
 
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
no I would classify that as treatment so
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
I guess that that's another thing that
 
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
concerns me here is do we have Clarity
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
on what is harm reduction versus what is
 
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
treatment because I don't see any
 
01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction would would
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
shut off Avenues to treatment but it it
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
it sort of brings more light to the the
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
concern that the definitions are are
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
poor all around and that that is my
 
01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
can I get your opinion on the harm
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
reduction definition yes so I think that
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
harm reduction is just any kind of
 
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
Public Health intervention that would
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
reduce harm that's why it feels like
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
that is so broad but but treatment is
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
clearly defined and treatment is also
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
harm reduction right it's under the
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
umbrella of because because receiving
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
treatment reduces harm reduces fatality
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
it is both
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
that's fair representative Merchant you
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
had a hand up earlier it was going back
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
initial part lines four through six I'm
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
sorry six through uh eight so if we want
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
to continue with the discussion about
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
harm reduction before we move on or sure
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay the issue I again trying to board
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
Smith it here
 
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on reading misuse
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
of drugs including alcohol
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
means using the substance in a manner or
 
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.630 align:start position:0%
means using the substance in a manner or
dose

01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
dose
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
for a purpose that is not consistent
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
I think that makes sense to me
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:16.850 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
um

01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
can I bring up like a conflict here so
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
I I on purpose most medicine is the
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
practice of making Simplicity out of
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
complexity my life is making the
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
practice of complexity out of simplicity
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
so a lot in the world that I live in
 
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of easily defined
 
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
terms and that creates a conflict when
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
you bring it into a legal or legislative
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
thing and we're trying to Define
 
01:20:44.689 --> 01:20:44.699 align:start position:0%
extremely complex issues with simple
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
language and I I think it's an
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
interesting dilemma
 
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:49.970 align:start position:0%
interesting dilemma
um

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
I I really like the definition that we
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
came up with I think that that works the
 
01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.910 align:start position:0%
came up with I think that that works the
best

01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:56.570 align:start position:0%
best
um

01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
anyways as far as the other issue the
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
prescription it's really important to me
 
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
personally to differentiate between
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
prescription and other substances I mean
 
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
to me personally in my world it's very
 
01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
important to differentiate between those
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
two and that's why I chose to do it
 
01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
I will leave it up to your decision as
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
to whether you want to do that or not
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
but and we can talk more about this um
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
but it's it's it's an important
 
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
differentiation again for protecting the
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
rights of the people that I represent so
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
anything else with the Department
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr Sherman
 
01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I hear that you have a very broad
 
01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction and you
 
01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
want to have every tool available how
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
critical is the section that allows for
 
01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
use of the general funds to that program
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
in order to increase your harm reduction
 
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.189 align:start position:0%
in order to increase your harm reduction
services

01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
there it is the the ability to fund our
 
01:21:56.209 --> 01:21:56.219 align:start position:0%
harm reduction right now is it does
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
affect whether or not those are
 
01:21:59.810 --> 01:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
sustainable programs so it in places
 
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
where the the federal government has
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
opened up available funding sources we
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
just need the ability to do that in New
 
01:22:08.209 --> 01:22:08.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to use those federal funds
 
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
potentially the scope of this
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
legislation just makes that allowable
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
but there is not a particular funding
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
source we would then begin using for
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
those fun for those programs immediately
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then thank you as a follow-up um it
 
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
seems that this whole program
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
um especially with that Focus towards
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
the the legal or medical differences
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
um how does this work
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I I guess when you're looking at harm
 
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
reduction and reducing the harm about
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
everything except for convictions for
 
01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
having one of these substances I guess
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out how you weigh
 
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
um all these other mitigation factors
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
and keep the criminality as one of those
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
crucial components when that
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
stigmatization of the criminality is one
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that leads to some of
 
01:22:56.290 --> 01:22:56.300 align:start position:0%
those negative outcomes
 
01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
this part piece of the statue is around
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission which does
 
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
include the the commission makeup itself
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
includes the Department of Justice and
 
01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
Corrections and so they do work closely
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
on how we also change other pieces of of
 
01:23:14.209 --> 01:23:14.219 align:start position:0%
Statute around the criminality of
 
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
substance use
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and but what this P but what they're
 
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
the funding piece around the governor's
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
commission does is specifically funding
 
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
for the harm reduction of substance use
 
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
in the space around public health and
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
and you know prevention treatment and
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
recovery and not within the the legal
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
piece around the criminality of
 
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
substance illicit substance use but it
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
does include treatment things like
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
treatment prevention and Recovery
 
01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
supports for folks who have been
 
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:44.780 align:start position:0%
involved in the criminal justice system
 
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
exiting incarceration is a particular
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
focus of the of samhsa and the CDC
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
because of the real increase rates of
 
01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
Overdose post incarceration
 
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:58.729 --> 01:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
anything else with the Department yes
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel you're way smarter
 
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
about this than me so I I wanted it I'm
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
curious as I read this I was
 
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
you know there's a two-part to this bill
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
there's the governor's commission
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
there's the opioid abatement commission
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to me that by that
 
01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
language that um you know eliminated
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
certain part allowed State funds to be
 
01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.050 align:start position:0%
certain part allowed State funds to be
used

01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
would that allow opioid abatement funds
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
to be used for these purposes that it's
 
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
not able to use now that's how I read it
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
but I may be wrong
 
01:24:33.649 --> 01:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement funds don't I don't
 
01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
sit in the state
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
General funds I'm trying to think of
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
exactly where they are sort of in the
 
01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
budget but it could potentially open up
 
01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
the the use of that funding source
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
I think the idea is to make sure that we
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
have access to all of those all of the
 
01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
funding sources if in fact there there
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
is that need and application with the
 
01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement funds people apply for
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
the funding and so if there was that
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
need and then the um it may be a funding
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
source that we can't that can do
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
something we can't do elsewhere right so
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
we have several restrictions especially
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
our federal funding sources all come
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
with specific restrictions and the
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement funds the best thing we
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
can do for New Hampshire is look at all
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
of our funding sources comprehensively
 
01:25:20.209 --> 01:25:20.219 align:start position:0%
and identify where our current funding
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
sources have gaps and use the opioid
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
abatement funds to plug those gaps yeah
 
01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.990 align:start position:0%
abatement funds to plug those gaps yeah
thanks

01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and just thank you
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I'm not sure
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
what part of the big department you
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
represent uh and uh if you could help us
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
because this is a complex
 
01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
issue and I think you were sent up to
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
clarify it but I don't know who you
 
01:25:54.719 --> 01:25:56.270 align:start position:0%
clarify it but I don't know who you
represent

01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I am a policy analyst and the
 
01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the division for
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health within the department
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
anything else for the Department
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none okay thank you very much
 
01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
so where do we stand with this amendment
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
is it going back to OLS or are we
 
01:26:23.689 --> 01:26:23.699 align:start position:0%
proceeding with a vote or I would think
 
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
proceed with a vote no oh
 
01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:30.129 align:start position:0%
proceed with a vote no oh
um

01:26:30.129 --> 01:26:30.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
okay we're borrowing your motion to
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
and who is the second I was second I
 
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
would draw okay
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll uh we'll wait for a
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
new Amendment uh addressing some of
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
these concerns that were expressed we
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
have another amendment
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
um that's all you have representative
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
Nagel right
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
and representative Leon has one uh thank
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
01:26:57.850 --> 01:26:57.860 align:start position:0%
um I'd move that we adopt um Amendment
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
2023-1621h for Senate Bill 239 and I'll
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh yes I'll second that
 
01:27:18.169 --> 01:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
motion okay thank you
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative land do you want to
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh thank you Mr
 
01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.669 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh thank you Mr
chairman

01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
um I think that this bill tackles a lot
 
01:27:27.169 --> 01:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
of different issues and I think we have
 
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
one thing that's definitely very
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
critical making sure that we're able to
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
have the doorways program making sure
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
that we're able to have drug checking
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
and that we're able to get out on the
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
street and do these quantifiable known
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
harm reduction efforts
 
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
um this is an area where I I think I
 
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate wanting to extend all of this
 
01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:50.219 align:start position:0%
harm reduction but I still remain very
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable by this Broad and
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
nebulous definition of
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
um any public health intervention that
 
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
would reduce harm because there's a lot
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
that can go into that I especially am
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
nervous with that with Section 13 which
 
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
um we already in statute had the ability
 
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
to use any federal funds that
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
um were on that we had the ability to
 
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
administer and or disperse Federal and
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
other funds to syringe service programs
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
authorized under this section the
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
section that part that's being struck in
 
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
13 is the prohibition of use of state
 
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
general funds so in this bill we both
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
have the ability to use the opioid
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
abatement trust fund and state general
 
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
funds for a all of the above type
 
01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.090 align:start position:0%
funds for a all of the above type
solution

01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:38.629 align:start position:0%
solution
um

01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
I want to tackle this program but I'd
 
01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
rather do it in steps as opposed to
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
jumping off of a cliff and hoping my
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
parachute was packed that's actually one
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
of these things
 
01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.570 align:start position:0%
of these things
um

01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:52.139 align:start position:0%
that's another topic I'm going to get
 
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
into with this um so if you go to come
 
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
to the bill I'll let you know which ones
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to remove
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
um well I guess which ones I'm looking
 
01:29:02.689 --> 01:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
to keep I think it's very important to
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
keep the president of the New Hampshire
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
Association if she's the chiefs of
 
01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
police or designee on the commission
 
01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:10.310 align:start position:0%
police or designee on the commission
um

01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
then we have section eight uh
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
sorry first page line 17
 
01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.470 align:start position:0%
sorry first page line 17
through

01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
and that's the one that puts the
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
association achieves the police this
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
would remove the broad language
 
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:35.219 align:start position:0%
um that's changing that definition from
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
abuse to misuse that clearly is a
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
challenge to Define and the harm
 
01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
reduction which is also a challenge to
 
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
Define that rather than trying to defend
 
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
Define that today and then send it back
 
01:29:47.689 --> 01:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
just for a community of conference as
 
01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:49.139 align:start position:0%
opposed to trying to have a larger
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
Dialogue on how to best Define these
 
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
terms quite frankly it would kick the
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
can down the road a little bit there but
 
01:29:56.570 --> 01:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that we're going to get to
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
agreement on definitions of misuse or
 
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
harm reduction so my offer here was to
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
remove those sections so that this whole
 
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
bill and the ver the good that can come
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
from it isn't lost in that debate over
 
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
definitions so then we would keep the
 
01:30:14.689 --> 01:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
association of chiefs of police on the
 
01:30:14.699 --> 01:30:16.310 align:start position:0%
association of chiefs of police on the
commission

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.030 align:start position:0%
commission
um

01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
and then in section three the
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
organization of the task force including
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
prevention and harm reduction is that
 
01:30:25.930 --> 01:30:25.940 align:start position:0%
blank check it's that full definition
 
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
that either is the one that people view
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
as too narrow or it's the one where it's
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
any public health intervention
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that that loses focus when
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
you're looking at everything and I'm not
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that and with that
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
language this bill doesn't have my
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
support so in order to try and reach
 
01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
compromise my Amendment removes that
 
01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:47.290 align:start position:0%
compromise my Amendment removes that
section

01:30:47.290 --> 01:30:47.300 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
similarly in section four the task force
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
it has that misuse and harm reduction in
 
01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.590 align:start position:0%
it has that misuse and harm reduction in
there

01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:30:57.649 --> 01:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
um as we roll into page two section five
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
has that harm reduction and misuse in
 
01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.950 align:start position:0%
has that harm reduction and misuse in
there

01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.270 align:start position:0%
there
um

01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
so not being comfortable with the
 
01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
definitions not being confident that we
 
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
will find one that I'm that I'm willing
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
to accept I think that it's better to
 
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
remove those sections then the meetings
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
and reports also use that same language
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
so we get into page three
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
page seven as well sorry section seven
 
01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
also has the misuse and harm reduction
 
01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:29.219 align:start position:0%
so page three
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
all right we're looking at a lot of
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
bolded and italic misuse and harm
 
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
reduction as we scroll through this and
 
01:31:37.129 --> 01:31:37.139 align:start position:0%
I apologize that I'm going quickly I'm
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out that right
 
01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
now on page three line 19.
 
01:31:46.679 --> 01:31:48.530 align:start position:0%
now on page three line 19.
I

01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's some challenges
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
around the definition of harm reduction
 
01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
but including some discussion of harm
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
reduction along with two or even
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
programs I figure as a way to get things
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
started and start discussing this in
 
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
these reports to to not have a blank
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
check to go Whole Hog on these but that
 
01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
gets that discussion moving into that
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
task force by speaking about the
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
potential of harm reduction in the
 
01:32:14.689 --> 01:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
report for eight I'm a little ambivalent
 
01:32:16.729 --> 01:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
on including that I probably if I were
 
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
to draft this again would take that
 
01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
section 8 out but I'm trying to
 
01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
compromise and get to something where we
 
01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
can get agreement so that's why I kept
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
that part with the harm reduction
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
and now we get to what I think is very
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
very important about this bill
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
section 9 on P online 21 of Page Three
 
01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
is when we get in to the syringe service
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
program funding
 
01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
um it does say including harm prevention
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
supplies so once again we're back to my
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
definition but I'm trying to find
 
01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
something that we can do to help people
 
01:32:53.090 --> 01:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
with these challenges
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
um so this would allow funding from the
 
01:32:59.209 --> 01:32:59.219 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement funds for the syringe
 
01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
service supplies which I think is a
 
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
reasonable use of those funds and then
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
section 10 starting at line 26 on line
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
three is the doorways program the
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder access points
 
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
I think that that's done a lot of good I
 
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose that over the
 
01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
confusion of definitions
 
01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
moving to page that stays in moving to
 
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
page four section 11 would stay in
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's the part that's including
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
criminal justice in the collaboration
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
around the servant and orange service
 
01:33:27.719 --> 01:33:29.149 align:start position:0%
around the servant and orange service
programs

01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
section 12 which is Consulting and
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
informing with Municipal law enforcement
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
agencies concerning the syringe service
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
programs and harm reduction activities
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
that would stay in that's important
 
01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.550 align:start position:0%
that would stay in that's important
collaboration

01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
01:33:43.129 --> 01:33:43.139 align:start position:0%
section 13 however would come out that
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
is the one that removes the prohibition
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
of state general funds
 
01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:48.830 align:start position:0%
of state general funds
um

01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
with an all-inclusive definition that
 
01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's too much for me to accept
 
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
now we get back to what I'm keeping of
 
01:33:59.930 --> 01:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
section 14 the syringe service programs
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
this is the one that allows the syringe
 
01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:05.060 align:start position:0%
exchange but it also includes
 
01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
specifically that the funds
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
being used by the opioid litigation
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
settlement can be used to support these
 
01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
programs I think that makes a lot of
 
01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:17.090 align:start position:0%
programs I think that makes a lot of
sense

01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
it also includes drug checking and I
 
01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
think drug checking is one of the most
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
important things that we can do in this
 
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
state right now we do not have a program
 
01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
that provides both more confidence to
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
users that they're only using what they
 
01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
intend to use when they buy drugs on the
 
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
street so they're looking at greater
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
harm and we don't know from a public
 
01:34:38.689 --> 01:34:38.699 align:start position:0%
health or legal standpoint what else is
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
in these drugs we don't know if trank is
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I think it's I
 
01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
keep confusing that with a sweetener
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
Xylitol or whichever it is so I'll go
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
with the street name of tranq we assume
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
that it's here because it'd be crazy to
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
assume that it's not but we don't know
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
the prevalence we don't know how much is
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
is contaminated with that
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
so I I think that that is absolutely
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
critical I think that's very important
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
um I had kept 15 and 16 which were
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
around the physician's assistance and
 
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
the Physicians and surgeons but with our
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier I almost think that
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to leave that in the
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
hands um of their their authority to
 
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
write the prescriptions for this because
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
if there's already a program that's done
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to write
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for Controlled Substances
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to duplicate that
 
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
and then provide training that won't be
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
used by people who don't pursue that
 
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.610 align:start position:0%
used by people who don't pursue that
license

01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
um so I would look to potentially have a
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
couple of those changes but I want to
 
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
talk about why I think it's so important
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
to be able to assess those risks by
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
having the drug checking stations if you
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
don't know what risk you're taking you
 
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
can't truly assess that risk I recognize
 
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
that when you're chasing a high your
 
01:35:49.129 --> 01:35:49.139 align:start position:0%
your risk and reward ratio may be a
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
little bit different than somebody who
 
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
hasn't encountered that same challenge I
 
01:35:55.970 --> 01:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned jumping off a cliff without a
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
parachute I used to jump out of planes
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
for fun and one of the big things we did
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
every spring is we sat down with safety
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
day we talk about how people died in the
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
previous year and try and figure out so
 
01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
that we and our friends wouldn't be
 
01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
those people that died
 
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
I am a relative newcomer to the sport
 
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
but as equipment improved and as it
 
01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
wasn't equipment malfunctions that were
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
killing people we still had the same
 
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
number of people dying
 
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
when something becomes safer people take
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
bigger risks it's called risk
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
homeostasis and that is one of the big
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
problems around mitigating some of the
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
natural consequences of of choices if
 
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
you jump out of a out of a plane you're
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to break the laws
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
of gravity you need to make sure that
 
01:36:41.689 --> 01:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
you're prepared and one of the biggest
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
reasons to tell people not to use drugs
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
is because quite frankly they'll destroy
 
01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
your life and your health and they may
 
01:36:51.169 --> 01:36:51.179 align:start position:0%
kill you and the people around you it's
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
not a good decision to make but taking
 
01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
away basically making it so that all
 
01:36:59.870 --> 01:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
everything wraps around you and supports
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
you because you've fallen into this big
 
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
challenge takes away a lot of the reason
 
01:37:07.129 --> 01:37:07.139 align:start position:0%
why people don't use drugs in the first
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
place and I think that that actually may
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
be a cause of harm and not a harm
 
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
reduction scenario when we make when we
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
make it too easy and too nice
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
facing abuse is never easy but we also
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
when you're when somebody is at a party
 
01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
faced with that consequence they're
 
01:37:29.219 --> 01:37:30.290 align:start position:0%
faced with that consequence they're
saying

01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
you know I've heard heroin feels really
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
good but I also know that there's that
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
the most likely way to get out of a
 
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
heroin addiction is death
 
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to take that it's not
 
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
worth that risk because it's that first
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
decision about whether to use or not to
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
use that that really locks people into a
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
path you know I've known too many people
 
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
with addiction I I'm just very very
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
cautious about stepping in too quickly
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
into this massive harm reduction I think
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
that this amendment
 
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
we could do a couple changes to it about
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
which sections but I think that this
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
amendment gives us the capabilities to
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
meet this challenge without going too
 
01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.270 align:start position:0%
meet this challenge without going too
far

01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
so that's why I brought this Broad and
 
01:38:12.649 --> 01:38:12.659 align:start position:0%
sweeping Amendment and I thank you for
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
01:38:20.590 --> 01:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
offering this amendment
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
um before this amendment came my vote on
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
the main bill was a hard no there's just
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to bore you with all the
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
reasons why I'm just a hard no
 
01:38:36.290 --> 01:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
um but this is such a huge Amendment
 
01:38:39.410 --> 01:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
with so many different changes that out
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
of respect to the Senate and out of
 
01:38:43.729 --> 01:38:43.739 align:start position:0%
respect to representative Leon I feel
 
01:38:43.739 --> 01:38:44.629 align:start position:0%
respect to representative Leon I feel
like

01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:38:47.689 --> 01:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
I couldn't vote on this right now I feel
 
01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
like I would need to go home in a quiet
 
01:38:51.890 --> 01:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
space and sit down and really read
 
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
everything that's been removed in order
 
01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
for me to I mean maybe maybe enough of
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
the things I don't like from the main
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
Bill have been removed that I could
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
support it and but I couldn't do that
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
right now I mean this is I mean we just
 
01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
spent like an hour talking about some
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that has like two lines change
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
and now we're talking about potentially
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
something that has like half the bill
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
removed so I appreciate the work which
 
01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
you've obviously put a lot into into
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
doing this and I think that personally
 
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
for me it would be it would just it
 
01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make sense to make a vote on
 
01:39:23.689 --> 01:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
that today I don't know if we can do
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
something to just like put this off and
 
01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
come back next week and then but if if
 
01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
if this got passed today I still would
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
vote no on the bill because I don't
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
fully know what just got passed with the
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
amendment I it's just too much for me to
 
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
sit here and talk about I have to read
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
it by myself so thank you
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
oh the discussion representative Nagel
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you that's really very Broad and
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtful I appreciate that
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
um two one comment one thought
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
um both accountants
 
01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
um I think everything we talked about
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
this before this whole issue of defining
 
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
things and and I threw out what I
 
01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
thought was helping what other people
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
thought was helpful but I I
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
I think it it does warrant a very large
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
discussion on what those issues mean and
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that but I think we do need
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
to develop a format to do that if we if
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about that the other
 
01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
thing that I wanted to talk about harm
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
reduction is I I've been involved with
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
the national project for about five
 
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
years at looking at Athletics and
 
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
developed a concept called justifiable
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
Risk by you know the decisions that make
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
people make when they decide to engage
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
in athletics which is not tremendously
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
different from what we're talking about
 
01:40:40.679 --> 01:40:42.229 align:start position:0%
different from what we're talking about
here

01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that became clear
 
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
in interviewing people from all over the
 
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
country is the concept of putting an
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
adult in the room to make decisions so I
 
01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
kind of look at harm reduction as a
 
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered thing not just the person
 
01:40:56.930 --> 01:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
making that choice but then people at
 
01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
multiple other levels having some
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
oversight or whatever setting Community
 
01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
standards whatever terms you want to use
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
to help people make wiser choices I
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't think it comes just down to that
 
01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
individual's Choice
 
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and I know that's simplistic but
 
01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's what we came up with
 
01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:15.649 align:start position:0%
that's what we came up with
um

01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:15.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to narrow that
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction too much to
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
just that individual's choice I want to
 
01:41:24.890 --> 01:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
make it broader than that but I do think
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's important that we go forward with
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
an important discussion about these and
 
01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
we could you know this is a national
 
01:41:33.169 --> 01:41:33.179 align:start position:0%
issue we could make a policy that would
 
01:41:34.850 --> 01:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
go to other states whether they want to
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
use it or not so that's important
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and
 
01:41:40.189 --> 01:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
representative Netter upper thank you
 
01:41:40.199 --> 01:41:40.910 align:start position:0%
representative Netter upper thank you
sure

01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:41:43.729 --> 01:41:43.739 align:start position:0%
a question to representative Leon first
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
of all thank you for pointing out your
 
01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.910 align:start position:0%
of all thank you for pointing out your
concerns

01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
most of the concerns that I heard
 
01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
revolve around the word harm reduction
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
almost every single section that you're
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
looking to remove from this
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
includes the word harm reduction
 
01:42:01.729 --> 01:42:01.739 align:start position:0%
if we come up with a definition of harm
 
01:42:01.739 --> 01:42:03.290 align:start position:0%
if we come up with a definition of harm
reduction

01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
that we all can support would that
 
01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
remove a lot of the objections to the
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
other sections you're looking to
 
01:42:09.179 --> 01:42:10.910 align:start position:0%
other sections you're looking to
eliminate

01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
01:42:13.370 --> 01:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question I
 
01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:14.090 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question I
think

01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I know I appreciate the work that
 
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel put into his
 
01:42:19.609 --> 01:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
definitions I actually found that
 
01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:21.179 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction to be
 
01:42:22.729 --> 01:42:22.739 align:start position:0%
overly broad because that would include
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
housing for people who had addiction
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
editions issues it would include so many
 
01:42:30.050 --> 01:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
different potential things that I think
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
that it's reaching too far I guess the
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
question around that would be
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
potentially a straw poll about whether
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
people think that that definition was
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
too loose or too broad and that would
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
give us an idea of if we would reach
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
some sort of agreement on a definition
 
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:51.659 align:start position:0%
um I must agree with representative Seth
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
King this is far too much to digest to
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
vote on today as last week I said can we
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
read them ahead of time so we can think
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
about them I need to read it
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I would also agree with
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
representative King that um maybe we
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
recess or come back to this next week
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
since we're going to be meeting anyway I
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
I do want to express my concerns about
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that representative
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
Leon said which is that um
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
or what I think she said which was on
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
the one hand harm reduction is a
 
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
positive because it keeps people from
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
harming themselves more than they
 
01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
otherwise would on the other hand we
 
01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
need to keep the potential harms
 
01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
available to people because this is the
 
01:43:44.330 --> 01:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
thing that actually will motivate them
 
01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
to stop using drugs so to to me those
 
01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
two things contradict each other
 
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
dramatically and
 
01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:55.689 align:start position:0%
dramatically and
um

01:43:55.689 --> 01:43:55.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I believe in harm reduction so I'm
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about I'm
 
01:44:04.609 --> 01:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
uh that's this is different than
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
um taking more time to to
 
01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:11.219 align:start position:0%
um kind of digest the amendment
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
um but I um I just want to express my
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:20.209 align:start position:0%
concern about
um

01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
about making sure the potential harms
 
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
and risks remain because those are going
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
to be the things that get people off
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
drugs and um
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
nothing is black and white but I I guess
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with that
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
well representative McKay and then
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Koval then representative
 
01:44:44.410 --> 01:44:44.420 align:start position:0%
land thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
what concerns me is
 
01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:54.169 --> 01:44:54.179 align:start position:0%
changing the governor's Commission on
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug abuse prevention
 
01:44:59.810 --> 01:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery I was once a
 
01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:04.139 align:start position:0%
member of this committee it seems to me
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's been well organized and well run
 
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
for many years and I have some grave
 
01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
concern as to how we get to this
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh based on what we've been discussing
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this is a
 
01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
changing something that is well
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
established and I don't hear anybody
 
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:45:32.770 --> 01:45:32.780 align:start position:0%
talked to the governor's Commission
 
01:45:37.090 --> 01:45:37.100 align:start position:0%
as to its and as to the need for change
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm very concerned about that part of
 
01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:40.810 align:start position:0%
so I'm very concerned about that part of
it

01:45:40.810 --> 01:45:40.820 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:45:44.209 --> 01:45:44.219 align:start position:0%
representative Koval
 
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I mean I I do
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
sort of remind people I there there was
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
there was one statement made in um
 
01:45:58.189 --> 01:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
in in the testimony on this bill that I
 
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
that really stands out for me is that
 
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
you know someone saying that people come
 
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
to me and they say
 
01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:04.430 align:start position:0%
to me and they say
um

01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
the syringe service program saved my
 
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
life so I think that that is something
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to keep in mind as as I
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
deliberate on this one at the same time
 
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
I do have these serious concerns and I
 
01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
think that the the definition of harm
 
01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:20.930 align:start position:0%
think that the the definition of harm
reduction

01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
as as the vice chair has pointed out
 
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's a
 
01:46:27.850 --> 01:46:27.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's still a very broad definition
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm not even sure we can agree on
 
01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.209 align:start position:0%
and I'm not even sure we can agree on
whether

01:46:32.209 --> 01:46:32.219 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
harm reduction and treatment are two
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
distinct things or whether harm
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
reduction or whether treatment is a
 
01:46:40.490 --> 01:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
subset of harm reduction as we heard
 
01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
today whether they're two separate
 
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
things as we heard in the hearing or
 
01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:47.030 align:start position:0%
things as we heard in the hearing or
whether

01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
harm reduction is a subset of treatment
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
as if you read the bill he talks about
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
treatment including harm reduction so I
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
I just I think that there's there's a
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
lot of real fuzziness I think a lot of
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
the people who are talking about this
 
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
sort of have an idea of what they know
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
what what they're what they're talking
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
about but I think that when it comes
 
01:47:08.350 --> 01:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
down to it it seems like there is a
 
01:47:11.689 --> 01:47:11.699 align:start position:0%
tremendous lack of clarity around what
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
these things mean and if there is a
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
successful program in place and if
 
01:47:18.609 --> 01:47:18.619 align:start position:0%
people are saying this saved my life
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
that's great we should you know we
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
should continue to do what we can to
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
save lives
 
01:47:26.990 --> 01:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
my concern is that as we as we change
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
that as we expand that let's make sure
 
01:47:32.689 --> 01:47:32.699 align:start position:0%
that we're doing this properly so that
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
we're not opening the door
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
to something that nobody's really clear
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
at this point what it is so that that's
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
my concern about the bill I support the
 
01:47:42.119 --> 01:47:43.310 align:start position:0%
my concern about the bill I support the
amendment

01:47:43.310 --> 01:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:47:46.129 --> 01:47:46.139 align:start position:0%
um because I think it it removes a lot
 
01:47:48.290 --> 01:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
of that lack of clarity or a lot of
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
those areas that are very unclear
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and then
 
01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel uh thank you Mr
 
01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:55.010 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel uh thank you Mr
chairman

01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:47:56.689 --> 01:47:56.699 align:start position:0%
um the first that I want to say is I was
 
01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
trying to do something so that I could
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
support the good that's in this bill I
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
received the language of this amendment
 
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:02.820 align:start position:0%
at 9 25 a.m
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and it just picked it up from
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
upstairs so sorry that it was so late
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
um to representative Shapiro's Point um
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make sure that we do have
 
01:48:13.729 --> 01:48:13.739 align:start position:0%
the syringe exchange and the drug
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
checking in place and to have some
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded harm reduction efforts I
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
think that that larger conversation
 
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
um part of that question is how much of
 
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
that comes from taxpayers where we're
 
01:48:28.609 --> 01:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
authorizing any sort of harm reduction
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
and how much can come and potentially if
 
01:48:33.649 --> 01:48:33.659 align:start position:0%
you're private funding or something else
 
01:48:35.570 --> 01:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
show that other modalities of harm
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
reduction do actually reduce that harm
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
and lead to less drug use as opposed to
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
just changing the course for people who
 
01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:45.179 align:start position:0%
are using drugs or potentially increased
 
01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:47.699 align:start position:0%
drug use so I think that we need to be
 
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
careful of those consequences that's why
 
01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
instead of just opposing the bill I'm
 
01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to have the
 
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
syringe service programs and the drug
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
checking in here and then representative
 
01:49:01.010 --> 01:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
McKay my Amendment actually reduces the
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
changes that are being made to the
 
01:49:04.609 --> 01:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
commission it does keep that change with
 
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
having the police Chiefs in there but
 
01:49:08.689 --> 01:49:08.699 align:start position:0%
otherwise I remove most of those changes
 
01:49:10.609 --> 01:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
to the commission
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay were you referring to the entire
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill or just the um the amendment or the
 
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
that uh that we're dealing with now may
 
01:49:24.010 --> 01:49:24.020 align:start position:0%
I answered go ahead
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about the Amendment
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh which modifies the membership and
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
Reporting requirements of the governor's
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
Commission on alcohol and drug abuse
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's part of it it seems to me that
 
01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
that's the bill though not the amendment
 
01:49:43.609 --> 01:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:46.139 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I understand it it seemed like
 
01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
you were happy with the way things are
 
01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
and you didn't want to see any changes
 
01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
am I wrong about that
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh okay I'm not very happy with any part
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
of this but I am concerned about uh
 
01:50:03.290 --> 01:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
changing something as significant
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
as this without going into
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
some study beforehand it just seems to
 
01:50:11.890 --> 01:50:11.900 align:start position:0%
be an afterthought
 
01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.609 align:start position:0%
be an afterthought
and

01:50:13.609 --> 01:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:15.970 --> 01:50:15.980 align:start position:0%
I would like to if
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
I don't see any need to modify
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission as it is in
 
01:50:25.129 --> 01:50:25.139 align:start position:0%
the first place but if we were to do
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
that I think that this bill should be
 
01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
retained and yeah I just wanted to if I
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
could um the reason why the bill was was
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
brought up was to me twofold
 
01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
um number one I was involved in the
 
01:50:43.490 --> 01:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
interagency Task Force on creating a
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
unified statement on pain management
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
that involved 13 different federal
 
01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
agencies it was really entertaining at
 
01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.189 align:start position:0%
agencies it was really entertaining at
best

01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
um mostly to just keep the acronyms
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
straight but
 
01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
what I've also been impressed with in
 
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
this state is that we're seeing
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
increasing numbers of agencies that need
 
01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
to work together and I think that one of
 
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
the reasons that this bill came is
 
01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
number one is to allow them to
 
01:51:13.129 --> 01:51:13.139 align:start position:0%
coordinate their services better and
 
01:51:15.649 --> 01:51:15.659 align:start position:0%
Jennifer tell me if I'm wrong but
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
um you know to coordinate their services
 
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
better use up-to-date and unified
 
01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:23.510 align:start position:0%
better use up-to-date and unified
nomenclature

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
nomenclature
 
01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.169 align:start position:0%
nomenclature
um

01:51:24.169 --> 01:51:24.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:27.179 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the governors um that
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
you that you were on the governor's
 
01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
there is a very well defined section
 
01:51:34.970 --> 01:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
here on harm reduction so as we went
 
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
forward with the opio debatement
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
commission that was one of the things
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
that was asked if we could include that
 
01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
in the opioid abatement commission so
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
including harm reduction in the terms
 
01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
was important and that's why it was
 
01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
added I totally understand the concept
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
of defining what that means and that's a
 
01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
challenge and maybe we should spend more
 
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
time on that but that's why those
 
01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
changes were made it wasn't to recreate
 
01:51:58.609 --> 01:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
any Wheels it was it was done to
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
actually improve the interaction of
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
different agencies together I think that
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
responds to my concern under that that
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
this is leading to significant changes
 
01:52:13.090 --> 01:52:13.100 align:start position:0%
that I
 
01:52:17.890 --> 01:52:17.900 align:start position:0%
have and it's not
 
01:52:20.689 --> 01:52:20.699 align:start position:0%
believing that the that this commission
 
01:52:28.609 --> 01:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.619 --> 01:52:29.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:52:29.530 --> 01:52:29.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:33.649 --> 01:52:33.659 align:start position:0%
yeah representative uh Floyd Lloyd I'm
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
sorry hi as a substitute and knowing
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
that I may not be here when this is
 
01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
again discussed I would just like to
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
throw out there I did appreciate the
 
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:47.820 align:start position:0%
note about specific to the licensure
 
01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:49.010 align:start position:0%
note about specific to the licensure
changing

01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:52:51.709 --> 01:52:51.719 align:start position:0%
um possibly impacting like veterinarians
 
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
and and those types of services and I
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
just urge the committee to really be
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
very careful about DEA licenses
 
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
um and and the process to get those
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
specific to Animal Welfare agencies I
 
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
know that things drugs like ketamine
 
01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
xylazine those types of things are used
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
in procedures
 
01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:13.850 align:start position:0%
in procedures
um

01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh to sedate animals so I just uh keep
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%
that in mind please thank you
 
01:53:21.850 --> 01:53:21.860 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
obviously this has become very
 
01:53:26.570 --> 01:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
complicated and um
 
01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:29.810 align:start position:0%
complicated and um
and

01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.209 --> 01:53:32.219 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
so one question I have is whether to put
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
this up till next week and refine some
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
of these amendments or to retain the
 
01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:41.390 align:start position:0%
of these amendments or to retain the
bill

01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
so that it can be worked on and more
 
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
over more time and with more depth but
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'm unsure about what the
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
urgency is from the Department of
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
um Health and Human Services if we were
 
01:53:55.729 --> 01:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
to retain the bill and what the
 
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
consequences would be I'm I I know
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's some things about funding for
 
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
some of these services so I wonder if we
 
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
could hear from them about what the
 
01:54:07.729 --> 01:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
consequences would be of retaining the
 
01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
bills so we can have all the discussion
 
01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:11.699 align:start position:0%
that people are saying we need I mean
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
keep in mind we already have quite a few
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
retained bills but uh yeah could
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Department come
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.609 --> 01:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
Danielle Higgins I'm legislative liaison
 
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
for Behavioral Health for DHHS and so
 
01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
this bill did come from representative
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
Waters who sits on the governor's
 
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
commission the governor's commission was
 
01:54:38.209 --> 01:54:38.219 align:start position:0%
is you know after the study committee on
 
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
harm reduction the recommendations came
 
01:54:42.290 --> 01:54:42.300 align:start position:0%
out of that legislative study committee
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
on harm reduction and were discussed
 
01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
with the governor's commission so it's
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
not a department bill but it would be
 
01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
really helpful in opening up the funding
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
to help make sure that we have every
 
01:54:54.109 --> 01:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
tool in our toolbox to curb overdose and
 
01:54:55.850 --> 01:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
be able to get more Upstream in our
 
01:54:57.129 --> 01:54:57.139 align:start position:0%
prevention and intervention services
 
01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:00.659 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
so um is the funding that you're talking
 
01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
about just Federal funding not State
 
01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:07.070 align:start position:0%
about just Federal funding not State
funding

01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
because I think that's a concern always
 
01:55:12.169 --> 01:55:12.179 align:start position:0%
the scope of the legislation opens up
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
harm reduction services to availability
 
01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
of state and federal funding which would
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
include abatement and Governor's
 
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
commission funds neither neither of
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
which touch General funds just
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
specifically would open up these other
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
funding sources that are available to
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so what do you view as the
 
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
biggest consequence if we do retain this
 
01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:34.970 align:start position:0%
biggest consequence if we do retain this
bill

01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
we just have less Avail available
 
01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
funding for the potential of these harm
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
reduction services
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay for like another year until we
 
01:55:46.609 --> 01:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
passed it right so the opioid abatement
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
funding in particular has allowed the
 
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to fill gaps in
 
01:55:55.129 --> 01:55:55.139 align:start position:0%
current funding sources and the purpose
 
01:55:57.530 --> 01:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
of making sure that we can also fund
 
01:55:59.209 --> 01:55:59.219 align:start position:0%
harm reduction Services is to reduce
 
01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
overdose fatalities
 
01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative land
 
01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up
 
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:07.739 align:start position:0%
um so it sounds like there are no
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
current funding requests in so if we
 
01:56:12.530 --> 01:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
were to take this up and and it came to
 
01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
the floor in January versus May
 
01:56:17.209 --> 01:56:17.219 align:start position:0%
um would there be there wouldn't be a
 
01:56:18.530 --> 01:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
direct impact it would just be about
 
01:56:21.169 --> 01:56:21.179 align:start position:0%
future requests is that correct there
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
are current requests in for harm
 
01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
reduction Services actually today at GNC
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
there are sick the first 16
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
um of the opioid abatement Grant
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
Agreements are at GNC today so that the
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement funds are beginning
 
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
to move at this point and the governor's
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
commission already is has been doing
 
01:56:41.149 --> 01:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
this work for a number of years so that
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
the funding is in motion and the
 
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
expansion of availability of funds for
 
01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
syringe Services programs is the scope
 
01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
of the legislation before you
 
01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
that availability of that funding to go
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
to that specific carbon auction program
 
01:56:58.910 --> 01:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel um I just expand on
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
that I mean one of our big tasks right
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
now is to solicit War grants and
 
01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
um that would I would assume would
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
affect what types of Grants we could
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
solicit at this point so that's a now
 
01:57:15.169 --> 01:57:15.179 align:start position:0%
thing am I correct yes I mean we're
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
meeting on
 
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
it's Monday to talk about that so that's
 
01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
important representative Merchant
 
01:57:24.970 --> 01:57:24.980 align:start position:0%
for clarification
 
01:57:28.970 --> 01:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
this RSA governs the abatement program
 
01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
or the abatement program has its own RSA
 
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
under its own guidelines I'm getting
 
01:57:36.169 --> 01:57:36.179 align:start position:0%
confused here between what role the
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
abatement program has in its funding
 
01:57:40.129 --> 01:57:40.139 align:start position:0%
mechanism and what it's allowed to do
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
versus this bill
 
01:57:44.810 --> 01:57:44.820 align:start position:0%
interfering with that so I'm not sure
 
01:57:46.609 --> 01:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
exactly but one's going to augment it
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
one's going to displace it can you help
 
01:57:51.890 --> 01:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
clarify the role of this bill versus the
 
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
role coming from the abatement funding
 
01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:55.070 align:start position:0%
role coming from the abatement funding
program

01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
I apologize I don't have the bill in
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
front of me to point you to the specific
 
01:57:59.570 --> 01:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
sections but there are sections of the
 
01:58:01.609 --> 01:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
legislation around the governor's
 
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
commission sections of the legislation
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
around opioid abatement commission and
 
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
then sections of the legislation around
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
harm reduction syringe Services programs
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
that allow for the available funding to
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
be used for those purposes in any of all
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
state and general funds and so I'm sorry
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
um not General funds federal and state
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
funding and so that the that last
 
01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
section around syringe Services Program
 
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
is the piece that opens up the
 
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
availability of those other funding
 
01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:30.179 align:start position:0%
sources I was mentioning which are other
 
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:36.649 --> 01:58:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh representative Nagel um Senate Bill
 
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
32 that we passed
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
um that was the big addition was harm
 
01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:42.709 align:start position:0%
um that was the big addition was harm
reduction

01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:44.930 align:start position:0%
um and so
um

01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:47.330 --> 01:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
that was adding harm reduction to one of
 
01:58:48.890 --> 01:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
the 17
 
01:58:51.649 --> 01:58:51.659 align:start position:0%
um potential items for soliciting funds
 
01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
from the opioid abatement commission
 
01:58:56.930 --> 01:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant again I'm really
 
01:59:00.599 --> 01:59:01.729 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant again I'm really
lost

01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
lost
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
so on Senate Bill 32 which we passed
 
01:59:07.370 --> 01:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
that deals with the use of the abatement
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
funds which includes harm reduction
 
01:59:13.850 --> 01:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
that bill added there's 17 or there were
 
01:59:16.129 --> 01:59:16.139 align:start position:0%
16 entities by which you could solicit
 
01:59:19.250 --> 01:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
fund or right solicit or put a grant and
 
01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:20.270 align:start position:0%
fund or right solicit or put a grant and
whatever

01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:59:22.850 --> 01:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
harm reduction was added as part of that
 
01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:24.410 align:start position:0%
harm reduction was added as part of that
bill

01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
so so that's now a reason why you can
 
01:59:29.450 --> 01:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
ask for funds well it's not yet it has
 
01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
to pass the governor but we'll go back
 
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
to again the same thing if we retain
 
01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
it's nothing prohibits somebody from
 
01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
going to the abatement program and
 
01:59:40.129 --> 01:59:40.139 align:start position:0%
asking for Grants correct for harm
 
01:59:43.370 --> 01:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
reduction I don't know well there is
 
01:59:44.930 --> 01:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
that last section of this bill around
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
syringe services that say that state
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
funding cannot be utilized and so the
 
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
abatement funds are State funding and so
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
it is making sure that while today
 
01:59:57.410 --> 01:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
programs can apply to the abatement fund
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
under that our harm reduction programs
 
02:00:03.169 --> 02:00:03.179 align:start position:0%
we have in statute that syringe Services
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
can't receive federal and state funds
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
and that's the change being made in this
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill before you
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
so my question is listening to
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's Amendment
 
02:00:21.649 --> 02:00:21.659 align:start position:0%
would per Amendment if that passed would
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
would that work and enable These funds
 
02:00:28.129 --> 02:00:28.139 align:start position:0%
to be accessed maybe maybe you have to
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
look into that a little bit more but
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's sort of like a seems to me a key
 
02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.570 align:start position:0%
that's sort of like a seems to me a key
question

02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes unfortunately I just would need to
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
review what those parts of the bill that
 
02:00:38.810 --> 02:00:38.820 align:start position:0%
are the sections that are being removed
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in depth before I felt
 
02:00:42.729 --> 02:00:42.739 align:start position:0%
like I could answer that
 
02:00:45.290 --> 02:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
02:00:47.089 --> 02:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you as you look
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
into this to me
 
02:00:51.290 --> 02:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
um it looks like the big key in this is
 
02:00:54.290 --> 02:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
section 14 the controlled Drug Act
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
syringe service programs that allows
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
um the federal funds to be used for drug
 
02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
checking drug cracking equipment drug
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
supplies eligible activities and that it
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
provides that permission in order to use
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
those funds that that to me is the most
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
important part of the bill and that's
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
what I was looking to preserve I know
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
that you speak to a Prohibition on
 
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
syringe services for State funds however
 
02:01:22.129 --> 02:01:22.139 align:start position:0%
section 13 that strikes it just just
 
02:01:25.010 --> 02:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
prohibits state general funds it doesn't
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
prohibit any of these other special
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
funds and so I I would be would be very
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
interested to know if just that section
 
02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
14 if we pass just that if that would
 
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
get us through to be able to introduce a
 
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
bill in the coming year to then address
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
the rest of these issues and not hold up
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
a pressing need to offer greater
 
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
services and access that funding in
 
02:01:50.930 --> 02:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
order to deal with these more esoteric
 
02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:51.830 align:start position:0%
order to deal with these more esoteric
parts

02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
parts
 
02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:52.790 align:start position:0%
parts
so

02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:55.129 --> 02:01:55.139 align:start position:0%
I wish I had a very direct clear answer
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
for you today but it is something I feel
 
02:01:59.930 --> 02:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Merchant thank you
 
02:02:06.290 --> 02:02:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call on representative
 
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
walner who's from the finance problem
 
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
my understanding the way the money is
 
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
Flowing from the opiate abatement
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
programs go into a designated fund not
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
into the general fund so therefore the
 
02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
questions are very representative
 
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
Wallner is that if the funds from the
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
abatement program are going to a
 
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
designated fund and therefore not that
 
02:02:34.129 --> 02:02:34.139 align:start position:0%
the general funds is in fact on page
 
02:02:34.139 --> 02:02:36.169 align:start position:0%
the general funds is in fact on page
four

02:02:36.169 --> 02:02:36.179 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:02:38.209 --> 02:02:38.219 align:start position:0%
lines 18.
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
about the use of General funds
 
02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
how does that impact because if they're
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
not going to the general funds but it's
 
02:02:47.689 --> 02:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
in a designated fund is that in fact
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
could you use the microphone
 
02:02:59.930 --> 02:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.729 --> 02:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
I've been trying to read it on my phone
 
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
so it's a little it's a little hard to
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
to really
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
see it I mean when I see in the original
 
02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:08.870 align:start position:0%
see it I mean when I see in the original
bill

02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
that you have what it looks like to me
 
02:03:12.649 --> 02:03:12.659 align:start position:0%
is what
 
02:03:12.659 --> 02:03:13.370 align:start position:0%
is what
um

02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:15.229 --> 02:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
proposing by striking out the use of
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
state general funds they they struck
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
that out that prohibition and would
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
allow the allow any it looks like any
 
02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:29.780 align:start position:0%
state funds to be used for this purpose
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the attorney if that is
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
her agreement with that
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
so my expertise is in Behavioral Health
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
if I'm not an attorney so just want to
 
02:03:40.679 --> 02:03:42.010 align:start position:0%
if I'm not an attorney so just want to
clarify

02:03:42.010 --> 02:03:42.020 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
I that would have that again would just
 
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
have to be a question for someone with
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.169 --> 02:03:54.179 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cofult
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes so I believe that the question was
 
02:03:59.450 --> 02:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
asked of the primary sponsor
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
um why that that section of Statute
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
would would be stricken in this uh in
 
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
and the answer we heard at that time was
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
well we just thought it was a good a
 
02:04:13.850 --> 02:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
good thing to do in case we want to use
 
02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
General funds in the future and that was
 
02:04:18.649 --> 02:04:18.659 align:start position:0%
put in in order to pass the original
 
02:04:20.689 --> 02:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
bill but I think everybody recognizes
 
02:04:22.729 --> 02:04:22.739 align:start position:0%
the value of syringe services at this
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
point so
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
um you know forgive me if I'm not
 
02:04:29.689 --> 02:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
remembering that with you know Precision
 
02:04:33.410 --> 02:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
but uh that that was the general gist of
 
02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
his statement and
 
02:04:37.129 --> 02:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
um you know it seems to me that that
 
02:04:41.570 --> 02:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
would align with the the statement that
 
02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:42.649 align:start position:0%
would align with the the statement that
um

02:04:42.649 --> 02:04:42.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know allowing for for use of the
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
opioid abasement fund abatement fund
 
02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
would not
 
02:04:50.099 --> 02:04:50.930 align:start position:0%
would not
um

02:04:50.930 --> 02:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
would not be prohibited if if we were to
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
restore that language or or to remove
 
02:04:59.209 --> 02:04:59.219 align:start position:0%
the that section that would strike out
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none we have a motion on the
 
02:05:11.209 --> 02:05:11.219 align:start position:0%
floor but I'm hearing
 
02:05:13.490 --> 02:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
mixed mixed signals here um
 
02:05:15.649 --> 02:05:15.659 align:start position:0%
representative Leon is Joe motion um
 
02:05:17.450 --> 02:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm I'm thinking
 
02:05:19.609 --> 02:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
that with all these moving pieces and
 
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
would knowing that the next big one is
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
large I was wondering if we could just
 
02:05:26.209 --> 02:05:26.219 align:start position:0%
recess for another earlier lunch that
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
way we have time if anything was going
 
02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
to go to OLS and that way we can sort of
 
02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
think about if if we can get some
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
answers when we come back from lunch
 
02:05:35.689 --> 02:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
about whether that's section 14 on the
 
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
syringe program would be enough to get
 
02:05:41.089 --> 02:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
us through to next year just to get some
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
information on that so that we we can
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
have a little bit more information
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
before we move that would be my
 
02:05:48.589 --> 02:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
suggestion but I'm well an hour's lunch
 
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
be sufficient I would do you do you
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
think we need more time than that
 
02:05:56.330 --> 02:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
it would probably be sufficient but I'm
 
02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
not sure if anybody else has other lunch
 
02:05:59.689 --> 02:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
plans if you should come back at one any
 
02:06:02.089 --> 02:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this does that seem to be a
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
potential solution representative I I
 
02:06:07.129 --> 02:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
don't think an hour is going to get us
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
where we need to feel comfortable about
 
02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
voting on this amendment or not
 
02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:13.129 align:start position:0%
voting on this amendment or not
um

02:06:13.129 --> 02:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:15.659 align:start position:0%
I would prefer to
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
table it to next week
 
02:06:19.609 --> 02:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
and then we can decide whether we're
 
02:06:19.619 --> 02:06:20.330 align:start position:0%
and then we can decide whether we're
gonna

02:06:20.330 --> 02:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:21.050 align:start position:0%
gonna
um

02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
retain it and prefer to move on to the
 
02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
next bill and be done earlier but anyway
 
02:06:27.719 --> 02:06:29.109 align:start position:0%
next bill and be done earlier but anyway
that's

02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative King you had a similar
 
02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:38.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:41.930 --> 02:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know upon upon more studies well
 
02:06:44.089 --> 02:06:44.099 align:start position:0%
all those everybody was talking I I
 
02:06:45.770 --> 02:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
don't think I'll be able to support the
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
main Bill even if this amendment were to
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
pass uh so on the one hand I think to
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
myself well I should vote for the
 
02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
amendment because it makes a bad Bill
 
02:06:57.290 --> 02:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
less bad on the other hand I don't want
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
to necessarily help the bill get passed
 
02:07:01.010 --> 02:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm in a quandary it's a political
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
quandary I know but um I don't know take
 
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
that as you will I always will vote for
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
longer lunches though because I am the
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
slowest eater here so
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay well yes representative Merchant
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
I would support
 
02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
um to table this until next week but
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
also I would like to be sure that during
 
02:07:22.490 --> 02:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:07:24.649 --> 02:07:24.659 align:start position:0%
there were tabling this that we don't
 
02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
just wait until next week to continue
 
02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
the conversation that we actually have a
 
02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
group of us sit down and talk about it
 
02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
but more importantly before we even move
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
forward I'd like to get clarification
 
02:07:37.129 --> 02:07:37.139 align:start position:0%
about the language on page four about
 
02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
the general funds versus opiate funds
 
02:07:43.609 --> 02:07:43.619 align:start position:0%
because if that is not the case where
 
02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
opiate of even funds can in fact be
 
02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
utilized in that capacity than we could
 
02:07:51.229 --> 02:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
possibly even retain this and work on it
 
02:07:53.689 --> 02:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
for a longer period of time so I guess
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
my question to the chair how do we find
 
02:07:59.570 --> 02:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
out who do we speak to to find out in
 
02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:00.350 align:start position:0%
out who do we speak to to find out in
fact

02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
fact
 
02:08:03.169 --> 02:08:03.179 align:start position:0%
that opiate of even funds are not
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
considered General funds that are
 
02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
outside of it
 
02:08:07.729 --> 02:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
and then at that point in time would
 
02:08:09.290 --> 02:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
help me make the decision whether to
 
02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
retain this and then move forward
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:15.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
good question
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Nagle let me think
 
02:08:20.810 --> 02:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
um I there's multiple vehicles to answer
 
02:08:24.890 --> 02:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
that question but we have a meeting of
 
02:08:26.450 --> 02:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement Commission on
 
02:08:26.460 --> 02:08:27.589 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement Commission on
Monday

02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
um I can certainly reach out before that
 
02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
um to the person who really knows a lot
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
about that stuff before that
 
02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:37.250 align:start position:0%
about that stuff before that
um

02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:38.930 --> 02:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
um as far I just wanted to bring one
 
02:08:42.589 --> 02:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
other point up I'm a new legislator I do
 
02:08:44.689 --> 02:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
not feel comfortable in making new
 
02:08:47.330 --> 02:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
dramatic changes in language to an
 
02:08:49.250 --> 02:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
amendment on the Fly I just don't think
 
02:08:50.810 --> 02:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
it's good practice so I would rather
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
table two okay representative Murphy no
 
02:08:56.330 --> 02:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
I would I would Echo the same sentiment
 
02:08:57.290 --> 02:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
I am
 
02:08:59.330 --> 02:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say totally confused but I am
 
02:09:01.250 --> 02:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
somewhat confused
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
um with all the different changes that
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
we've talked about so if we had the
 
02:09:06.050 --> 02:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity of seeing
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
the Amendments that Dr I mean that
 
02:09:09.290 --> 02:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative Leon came up with but
 
02:09:11.689 --> 02:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
also the opportunity to perhaps work
 
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
with Dr Nagel about tweaking some of his
 
02:09:15.770 --> 02:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
language as well in his three amendments
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
having that in front of me over the next
 
02:09:20.209 --> 02:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
week would be so much easier for me to
 
02:09:21.770 --> 02:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
digest and understand and I think we
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
would save a lot of time doing that
 
02:09:26.330 --> 02:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
okay all right the motion is on the
 
02:09:28.850 --> 02:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
floor representative land which are
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
plots I can withdraw my motion okay
 
02:09:34.129 --> 02:09:34.139 align:start position:0%
uh who and who seconded that
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman and you would
 
02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
draw also yes okay so the sentiment is
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
to continue this until next week is that
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
correct okay we'll continue
 
02:09:52.370 --> 02:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
do we need to like create a subcommittee
 
02:09:56.689 --> 02:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
or do we just leave that as
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
random discussion I don't think random
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
discussion is a good idea
 
02:10:04.250 --> 02:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative representative Leon did
 
02:10:05.810 --> 02:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to that um uh thank
 
02:10:07.129 --> 02:10:07.139 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:10:11.209 --> 02:10:11.219 align:start position:0%
if it's a ad hoc group of um some number
 
02:10:12.890 --> 02:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
of people that are less than a quorum
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
there can be some discussion in order to
 
02:10:16.729 --> 02:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
address those problems and bring them
 
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
back to the great the larger group we
 
02:10:20.330 --> 02:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
can't have discussions as a group
 
02:10:22.729 --> 02:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
outside of these public hearings because
 
02:10:25.129 --> 02:10:25.139 align:start position:0%
that's our transparency but we can have
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
people go and reach those targeted
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
things we can send an amendment to the
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
people in the group so that they can see
 
02:10:31.970 --> 02:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
it but we just can't have discussions
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
outside this is an early bill by the way
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
so one way or another we need we need to
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
make a decision next week whether it's
 
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
retain or of other action yeah
 
02:10:42.530 --> 02:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant again for
 
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
clarification development representative
 
02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:45.109 align:start position:0%
clarification development representative
Leon

02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
Leon
 
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
if this is an ad hoc group and it's not
 
02:10:50.209 --> 02:10:50.219 align:start position:0%
a quorum not enough members of the
 
02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
community to create a quorum
 
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
how we permitted to meet via Zoom
 
02:10:57.050 --> 02:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
virtually versus being in person it
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
would make it easy I think for some of
 
02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:00.169 align:start position:0%
would make it easy I think for some of
us

02:11:00.169 --> 02:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:11:03.229 --> 02:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
I would say if it's an and Ms Dyer might
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
be able to advise us better on this but
 
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
if it's an informal group
 
02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
I would I would think a zoom would be
 
02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
would be feasible am I right about that
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
okay any other thoughts on uh Senate
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 239
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
all right we will continue that until
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
next week along with 240.
 
02:11:28.970 --> 02:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
and moving on to everybody's favorite
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
although at this point that we know this
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be a long discussion do we
 
02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
want a break for lunch and um come back
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
and again the what you're talking about
 
02:11:40.490 --> 02:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
is it going to be able to resolve in an
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
hour or should we just go to one of you
 
02:11:47.689 --> 02:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:49.250 --> 02:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
um I I think that there's a lot to be
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
discussed here
 
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
um if we're unless we're planning on
 
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
keeping our discussions to just a short
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
time and then adjourning at say one I
 
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
think it's better that we get some
 
02:12:00.609 --> 02:12:00.619 align:start position:0%
sustenance for the discussion ahead okay
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I would just like
 
02:12:04.189 --> 02:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
to Second
 
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
um that opinion um I would personally
 
02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:08.930 align:start position:0%
um that opinion um I would personally
since

02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
um judging from the discussion about the
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
last bill the discussion about the next
 
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
bill could go on for some time so I
 
02:12:18.169 --> 02:12:18.179 align:start position:0%
would like to um I would like to break
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
for lunch but not make it an extended
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
um lunch in Siesta so we can get back as
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
soon as possible 12 45 how does that
 
02:12:26.159 --> 02:12:27.410 align:start position:0%
soon as possible 12 45 how does that
work

02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
it will break for just a little over an
 
02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
hour we come back at 12 45.
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.639 --> 03:32:56.150 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:32:56.150 --> 03:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.969 --> 03:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
an afternoon and we're back
 
03:33:01.490 --> 03:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
a few minutes late but we're back for
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
the afternoon session
 
03:33:04.319 --> 03:33:05.090 align:start position:0%
the afternoon session
um

03:33:05.090 --> 03:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
we have covered as much as we're going
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
to today the four of the five bills that
 
03:33:12.170 --> 03:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
were noticed in the calendar
 
03:33:14.030 --> 03:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
the one remaining bill for us to
 
03:33:16.190 --> 03:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
consider this afternoon is Senate bill
 
03:33:16.200 --> 03:33:17.870 align:start position:0%
consider this afternoon is Senate bill
263.

03:33:17.870 --> 03:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
263.
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
and um at this point uh representative
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
Leon did you have a motion uh yes thank
 
03:33:25.550 --> 03:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I move that we retain
 
03:33:28.969 --> 03:33:28.979 align:start position:0%
house bill 263.
 
03:33:31.790 --> 03:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman seconds
 
03:33:33.769 --> 03:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to your motion uh yes
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman there's a lot of
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
confusion around Medicaid and Medicaid
 
03:33:40.250 --> 03:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
expansion we've received hundreds of
 
03:33:42.290 --> 03:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
different emails and a lot of them are
 
03:33:43.849 --> 03:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
actually talking about people with
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities children other groups that
 
03:33:49.370 --> 03:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
are covered by traditional Medicaid so I
 
03:33:51.889 --> 03:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
I think that I think that that's one
 
03:33:53.389 --> 03:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
area of confusion where we need to make
 
03:33:55.729 --> 03:33:55.739 align:start position:0%
sure that we understand what it is that
 
03:33:57.650 --> 03:33:57.660 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with here
 
03:33:59.630 --> 03:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
um there's also a lot of confusion about
 
03:34:02.830 --> 03:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
how this is in the statutes so right now
 
03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid's in the state of flux because
 
03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
we're unwinding the public health
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
emergency we have this language even
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
with all of its flaws in the budget it
 
03:34:15.050 --> 03:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
has a sunset in the budget and I support
 
03:34:16.910 --> 03:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
that I support our position that's in
 
03:34:18.229 --> 03:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
the budget and I think that that's the
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
right place for something of this
 
03:34:21.650 --> 03:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
magnitude if we're going to keep moving
 
03:34:24.229 --> 03:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
this forward I truly think the best
 
03:34:26.030 --> 03:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
place for this bill is in our committee
 
03:34:27.769 --> 03:34:27.779 align:start position:0%
working through the summer and the fall
 
03:34:29.510 --> 03:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
and looking at the fact that our
 
03:34:31.790 --> 03:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
statutes about half of the language
 
03:34:35.990 --> 03:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
switch of two 126 double A is actually
 
03:34:38.210 --> 03:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
expired because it says on or before
 
03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
this date we must do X it shows that
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
there are reasons why we needed to put
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
in requests for waivers and other things
 
03:34:47.330 --> 03:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
that were conditional and based on a
 
03:34:49.729 --> 03:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
time frame this is something that
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
encourages having a renewal date and
 
03:34:55.370 --> 03:34:55.380 align:start position:0%
having a sunset because
 
03:34:57.469 --> 03:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of people here probably don't want
 
03:34:58.849 --> 03:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
to touch the hot potato and Medicaid
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
expansion if we weren't up against the
 
03:35:02.570 --> 03:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
sunset I can guarantee you this wouldn't
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
be in front of us but our job here is to
 
03:35:07.130 --> 03:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
do the challenging difficult work of
 
03:35:09.290 --> 03:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
looking at our programs and making sure
 
03:35:12.650 --> 03:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
that they're operating as we expect
 
03:35:15.469 --> 03:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
um so as we look at this our current law
 
03:35:17.330 --> 03:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
lives in a couple places there's five
 
03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
sections in 126 double A and then
 
03:35:22.130 --> 03:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
there's some that's in chapter law of
 
03:35:24.110 --> 03:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
course it's hard to tell which parts of
 
03:35:26.090 --> 03:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
chapter law are still in effect because
 
03:35:29.150 --> 03:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
as I was digging into all of this
 
03:35:31.210 --> 03:35:31.220 align:start position:0%
um in 2018
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
the chapter law that stated that there
 
03:35:35.410 --> 03:35:35.420 align:start position:0%
was an expiration
 
03:35:38.210 --> 03:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
based on federal funding was revising
 
03:35:41.330 --> 03:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
chapter law from two previous times the
 
03:35:42.710 --> 03:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
idea of having something of this
 
03:35:45.229 --> 03:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
magnitude sprinkled across not just the
 
03:35:47.389 --> 03:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
rsas but also chapter law
 
03:35:50.269 --> 03:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
makes a confusing issue even more
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
confusing and passing this bill as we
 
03:35:55.010 --> 03:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
have it does nothing to solve that
 
03:35:57.229 --> 03:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
Clarity issue
 
03:35:58.849 --> 03:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
um then there was also the ones where we
 
03:36:01.070 --> 03:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
had a law that had a waiver request
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
recent history has shown that when the
 
03:36:06.110 --> 03:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
legislature wants the department or any
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
Department to submit a waiver we need to
 
03:36:09.410 --> 03:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
put that in writing and we need to put
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
that into statutes that's one of those
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
things that also gives that emphasis for
 
03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
them to pursue that waiver and perhaps
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
may give a little bit more heft when
 
03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
it's received down in DC because it's
 
03:36:22.550 --> 03:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
not just a department it's an apartment
 
03:36:25.010 --> 03:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
at the behest of the legislature and
 
03:36:27.830 --> 03:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
Governor making that request for a
 
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
waiver if you look across the country at
 
03:36:33.050 --> 03:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
the whole Medicaid Program it's a system
 
03:36:35.450 --> 03:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
built upon waivers so just because we're
 
03:36:37.309 --> 03:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
asking for a waiver for this that or the
 
03:36:40.130 --> 03:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
other doesn't mean that it doesn't mean
 
03:36:41.690 --> 03:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
that we're not following the law it's
 
03:36:44.570 --> 03:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
what it's based upon and so I I really
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
believe that this committee is the best
 
03:36:49.190 --> 03:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
place to work on this you know
 
03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
we're the ones who understand what
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
people are going through we have medical
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
professionals who have seen both sides
 
03:36:57.469 --> 03:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
of of the benefits of having patients
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid and some of the challenges
 
03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
of serving people with Medicaid we have
 
03:37:02.990 --> 03:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
people who have constituents who are
 
03:37:05.330 --> 03:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
talking about Services now
 
03:37:07.550 --> 03:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
I actually found out that we've had a
 
03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
sterilization Bill earlier about that
 
03:37:11.349 --> 03:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
right I found out in New Hampshire
 
03:37:15.170 --> 03:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
Medicaid will not pay for a hysterectomy
 
03:37:18.170 --> 03:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
unless you're over 37 or have children
 
03:37:20.030 --> 03:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
now that's the sort of thing we can fix
 
03:37:22.010 --> 03:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
when these things come up but it's very
 
03:37:25.729 --> 03:37:25.739 align:start position:0%
very hard to do without having a sunset
 
03:37:27.889 --> 03:37:27.899 align:start position:0%
and I I guess one other part that I do
 
03:37:30.110 --> 03:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
want to make clear because it is so
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
challenging is the difference between
 
03:37:34.969 --> 03:37:34.979 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and Medicaid expansion
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you have disabilities you are on
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that is one of the waivers if
 
03:37:41.990 --> 03:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're a kid you're on the children's
 
03:37:43.790 --> 03:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
health insurance plan which is rolled
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
into our traditional Medicaid lower
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
income families are in traditional
 
03:37:50.750 --> 03:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and retirees that need a
 
03:37:52.370 --> 03:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
supplement for long-term care or on
 
03:37:54.530 --> 03:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicaid none of those are
 
03:37:56.630 --> 03:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
up for this discussion that is something
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
that is in federal law we've agreed with
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
and we're we're going down that path
 
03:38:04.190 --> 03:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
forever hand in hand till even past till
 
03:38:05.570 --> 03:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
the death to us part because this
 
03:38:07.610 --> 03:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
survives all of us but Medicaid
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
expansion is that creation that came
 
03:38:13.790 --> 03:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
about from the Affordable Care Act it
 
03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
was a way in order to figure out how to
 
03:38:18.530 --> 03:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
bridge that Gap and provide government
 
03:38:20.450 --> 03:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
paid health care because if you were
 
03:38:21.950 --> 03:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to force people to get coverage
 
03:38:24.530 --> 03:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
you had to provide a solution it took us
 
03:38:27.229 --> 03:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
a long time to get to the point where we
 
03:38:28.630 --> 03:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
are here in New Hampshire
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
we'd walk through a couple different
 
03:38:33.530 --> 03:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
Pathways but as we walk down those
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
Pathways you know we figured out what we
 
03:38:38.450 --> 03:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
needed to do in order to get to the next
 
03:38:40.670 --> 03:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
step but I don't think this program is
 
03:38:43.130 --> 03:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
as strong as it could be if we really
 
03:38:45.290 --> 03:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
worked together in order to figure this
 
03:38:47.929 --> 03:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
out and you know lastly I also want to
 
03:38:49.610 --> 03:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
talk about there's a lot of efforts to
 
03:38:51.590 --> 03:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
increase the minimum wage there's a lot
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
of efforts to make sure that people are
 
03:38:55.550 --> 03:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
being paid a living wage
 
03:38:58.250 --> 03:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the cap on Medicaid
 
03:39:00.950 --> 03:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
expansion at 138 percent of the federal
 
03:39:02.750 --> 03:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
poverty level when you take away the
 
03:39:05.210 --> 03:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
five percent hold back that means that
 
03:39:07.790 --> 03:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
for a family of two they can't make more
 
03:39:09.590 --> 03:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
than twenty seven thousand two hundred
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
thirteen dollars and sixty cents a year
 
03:39:14.450 --> 03:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
so that means that if both of them are
 
03:39:17.030 --> 03:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
working for 100 hours a month which
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
would be the work requirement if it's
 
03:39:20.710 --> 03:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
reinstated they couldn't make more than
 
03:39:22.910 --> 03:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
11.34 cents an hour
 
03:39:24.650 --> 03:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
so in order to qualify for these
 
03:39:27.050 --> 03:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
benefits you're being locked into lower
 
03:39:29.570 --> 03:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
income work and that's a really really
 
03:39:32.450 --> 03:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
difficult position to be in so then if
 
03:39:34.190 --> 03:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
you had both of the family members and
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
that two-member adult-only household
 
03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
working full-time well unless they were
 
03:39:40.790 --> 03:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
servers who didn't get good tips they
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't because if you're making 7.25
 
03:39:45.469 --> 03:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
an hour the federal minimum wage with
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
two people in the household you don't
 
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
qualify for that so we need to look and
 
03:39:52.130 --> 03:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
see what it is that we're doing one of
 
03:39:52.140 --> 03:39:52.849 align:start position:0%
see what it is that we're doing one of
the

03:39:52.849 --> 03:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:54.830 --> 03:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
um so I have a number of different
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
solutions to get us closer to our rights
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
right right path
 
03:39:59.160 --> 03:40:00.530 align:start position:0%
right right path
um

03:40:00.530 --> 03:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:03.769 --> 03:40:03.779 align:start position:0%
I I mean when you look at this it's a
 
03:40:05.690 --> 03:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
program that really keeps people stuck
 
03:40:08.269 --> 03:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
in order to meet a need which is Health
 
03:40:08.279 --> 03:40:09.050 align:start position:0%
in order to meet a need which is Health
Care

03:40:09.050 --> 03:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
Care
 
03:40:12.349 --> 03:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
and we can't just pass this into the
 
03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
future with no Sunset and let this keep
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
going without taking on the important
 
03:40:18.650 --> 03:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
task of trying to make this better
 
03:40:21.769 --> 03:40:21.779 align:start position:0%
trying to make it stronger and also
 
03:40:25.070 --> 03:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that we ask for what
 
03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire need you
 
03:40:29.110 --> 03:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
know if you if you look at this we had
 
03:40:32.150 --> 03:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
we basically had rules passed down from
 
03:40:34.490 --> 03:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
DC as to how our hospitals could operate
 
03:40:36.650 --> 03:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
during covet because of the threat of
 
03:40:38.570 --> 03:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
the loss of Medicaid money
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
if we had had a position of submitting
 
03:40:43.070 --> 03:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
waivers for anything that's contrary to
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law we may have kept some
 
03:40:47.450 --> 03:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
more Health co-workers by having more
 
03:40:47.460 --> 03:40:48.650 align:start position:0%
more Health co-workers by having more
flexibility

03:40:48.650 --> 03:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
03:40:50.450 --> 03:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
and I think that this is our opportunity
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
to look at this so what I would suggest
 
03:40:52.560 --> 03:40:53.630 align:start position:0%
to look at this so what I would suggest
doing

03:40:53.630 --> 03:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
um is we have a couple different
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
amendments on these you know we're not
 
03:40:58.910 --> 03:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
really going to take them up but I want
 
03:41:01.010 --> 03:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
to discuss the different issues that we
 
03:41:03.229 --> 03:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
have with the program and sort of
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
concretely tell you how we could fix it
 
03:41:08.090 --> 03:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
so it isn't just the esoteric idea where
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
we sort of talked around each other last
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
week because just like the last bill
 
03:41:14.570 --> 03:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
um you know there's good in this but
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that can be improved and I
 
03:41:17.929 --> 03:41:17.939 align:start position:0%
think that we probably should take some
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
time to do that so um I'll probably ask
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
to be recognized later on but I think
 
03:41:24.590 --> 03:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
I've spoken for
 
03:41:26.889 --> 03:41:26.899 align:start position:0%
long enough stretch of time thank you
 
03:41:29.210 --> 03:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
03:41:31.849 --> 03:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against the motion to
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
03:41:33.359 --> 03:41:34.910 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
um

03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:39.889 --> 03:41:39.899 align:start position:0%
not only did this pass the Senate 24-0
 
03:41:39.899 --> 03:41:43.010 align:start position:0%
not only did this pass the Senate 24-0
um

03:41:43.010 --> 03:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:44.750 --> 03:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
the business the business community
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
supports this bill the health care
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
providers support this bill this bill is
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
provided Health Care to
 
03:41:56.690 --> 03:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
approximately sixty thousand Granite
 
03:41:56.700 --> 03:41:58.030 align:start position:0%
approximately sixty thousand Granite
Staters

03:41:58.030 --> 03:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
Staters
 
03:42:01.070 --> 03:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
the information that Senator Bradley
 
03:42:03.050 --> 03:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
gave when he introduced the bill talked
 
03:42:06.650 --> 03:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
about the amount of churn among people
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
who have been on Medicaid expansion in
 
03:42:12.650 --> 03:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
other words people did not just remain
 
03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid expansion and become
 
03:42:17.809 --> 03:42:17.819 align:start position:0%
dependent that it actually supported
 
03:42:21.050 --> 03:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
people's resilience and um
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
allowed people to be healthy enough to
 
03:42:27.070 --> 03:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
go to work I could talk for a long time
 
03:42:30.530 --> 03:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to talk anymore but I
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
would I would hope that we could have a
 
03:42:34.250 --> 03:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
vote fairly quickly about this so that
 
03:42:36.410 --> 03:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
we can get on with
 
03:42:39.410 --> 03:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
um the discussion about what if anything
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:44.929 --> 03:42:44.939 align:start position:0%
uh representative Palmer
 
03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
so representative Shapiro
 
03:42:50.269 --> 03:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
started with the first several of my
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
reasons why I won't I will vote against
 
03:42:57.290 --> 03:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
retaining the biggest ones are
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the Senate voting 24
 
03:43:02.389 --> 03:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
to nothing every single
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
comment I've had from my constituents
 
03:43:07.370 --> 03:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
has been in favor of passing this bill
 
03:43:10.969 --> 03:43:10.979 align:start position:0%
our hospital system is at a crisis point
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is a key piece for now regardless
 
03:43:15.410 --> 03:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
of whether you don't think our current
 
03:43:17.990 --> 03:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
medical system is is a mess I completely
 
03:43:20.570 --> 03:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
agree but if you take a take it try to
 
03:43:22.370 --> 03:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
take it apart piece by piece it's just
 
03:43:25.550 --> 03:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
going to collapse right now and there'll
 
03:43:27.650 --> 03:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
be at least 60 000 people without health
 
03:43:30.769 --> 03:43:30.779 align:start position:0%
care if we don't pass this and they'll
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
be you know other disruptions in the
 
03:43:35.630 --> 03:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
medical system that will affect more
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
people if we don't keep this going so I
 
03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
I think we need to move forward in a way
 
03:43:43.250 --> 03:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this becomes law this
 
03:43:43.260 --> 03:43:45.110 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this becomes law this
year

03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:43:47.809 --> 03:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
uh representative King Seth King thank
 
03:43:48.889 --> 03:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
03:43:48.899 --> 03:43:49.610 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
um

03:43:49.610 --> 03:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:51.650 --> 03:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
I think to address
 
03:43:55.490 --> 03:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
um both Representatives concerns
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that it was overwhelmingly
 
03:44:02.349 --> 03:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
passed in the Senate much to my chagrin
 
03:44:05.210 --> 03:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion is is popular it
 
03:44:07.429 --> 03:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
seems pretty popular so
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
um I think what that actually says to me
 
03:44:13.630 --> 03:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
is that you need not fear future
 
03:44:17.330 --> 03:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
legislators or legislative bodies
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of Medicaid expansion if
 
03:44:22.250 --> 03:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
it if it is as popular as we think it is
 
03:44:26.929 --> 03:44:26.939 align:start position:0%
but um the permanency is I think
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous really for any any program I
 
03:44:30.530 --> 03:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support I don't think I would
 
03:44:32.570 --> 03:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
support permanency for any sort of
 
03:44:36.429 --> 03:44:36.439 align:start position:0%
program let the legislators next session
 
03:44:39.410 --> 03:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
deal with these things
 
03:44:41.809 --> 03:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
so that's my stance it's it's a popular
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
program even though I don't personally
 
03:44:46.610 --> 03:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
like it and I don't see what the fear is
 
03:44:49.370 --> 03:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
of just letting it continue on normally
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:52.969 --> 03:44:52.979 align:start position:0%
representative Coachman thank you Mr
 
03:44:52.979 --> 03:44:54.469 align:start position:0%
representative Coachman thank you Mr
chairman

03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:44:57.229 --> 03:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
um I understand that it did pass the
 
03:44:59.809 --> 03:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
Senate 24 to zero but we are at our own
 
03:45:02.510 --> 03:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
body and we are elected by our
 
03:45:04.729 --> 03:45:04.739 align:start position:0%
constituents to vote how we believe we
 
03:45:07.790 --> 03:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
should we should vote and
 
03:45:10.490 --> 03:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
um there are after combing through this
 
03:45:13.370 --> 03:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
program there are so many things in it
 
03:45:15.830 --> 03:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
03:45:17.450 --> 03:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
I don't see them as being the New
 
03:45:19.070 --> 03:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way of doing things it seems
 
03:45:20.990 --> 03:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
that it's just we took a cookie cutter
 
03:45:23.570 --> 03:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
Federal program and put it into our laws
 
03:45:25.070 --> 03:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
we've heard the statements that there
 
03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
are protections for taxpayers in this
 
03:45:27.840 --> 03:45:29.570 align:start position:0%
are protections for taxpayers in this
but

03:45:29.570 --> 03:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:45:32.030 --> 03:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
um and you know perhaps it's in chapter
 
03:45:34.010 --> 03:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
law but as it's written right now that
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
in in the RSA 126 double a
 
03:45:41.290 --> 03:45:41.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.010 --> 03:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh Roman I'm sorry section three Roman
 
03:45:46.020 --> 03:45:47.750 align:start position:0%
uh Roman I'm sorry section three Roman
six

03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
six
 
03:45:49.610 --> 03:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
um that Severance Clause where you've
 
03:45:52.910 --> 03:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
been told well we've heard that um if
 
03:45:54.530 --> 03:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
the federal government stops paying
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
their 90 share and they reduce it that
 
03:45:59.570 --> 03:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
the program ends well that's that's
 
03:46:01.790 --> 03:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
actually not what it says
 
03:46:03.889 --> 03:46:03.899 align:start position:0%
um there in the statute and it's been
 
03:46:06.290 --> 03:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
changed and I actually have a a paper
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
which my caucus has so if we could pass
 
03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
some of these out to
 
03:46:11.040 --> 03:46:12.349 align:start position:0%
some of these out to
um

03:46:12.349 --> 03:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
the other members of the committee that
 
03:46:16.670 --> 03:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful shows the evolution
 
03:46:18.889 --> 03:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
of that that text
 
03:46:23.710 --> 03:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
um since about 2014 so there have been
 
03:46:26.330 --> 03:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
it's been kind of chipped away at over
 
03:46:30.849 --> 03:46:30.859 align:start position:0%
time and now really the only way that um
 
03:46:34.130 --> 03:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
uh this program will be
 
03:46:37.309 --> 03:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
um if we don't have the money in the
 
03:46:40.250 --> 03:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
trust fund the granite Advantage Health
 
03:46:43.370 --> 03:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
Plan trust fund to cover it
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
um it used to be that
 
03:46:48.530 --> 03:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
um there was a trigger you know if it
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
went under 95 by this year the 95 4 by
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:46:56.389 --> 03:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
down to 90 percent of uh where it was
 
03:46:59.450 --> 03:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
and I believe 2019 was the last year
 
03:47:02.030 --> 03:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's been removed completely now it
 
03:47:04.370 --> 03:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
the RSA only says that if there's
 
03:47:08.050 --> 03:47:08.060 align:start position:0%
nothing if the commissioner finds that
 
03:47:10.370 --> 03:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
there are not sufficient funds in The
 
03:47:12.590 --> 03:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission fund to cover a
 
03:47:12.600 --> 03:47:13.610 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission fund to cover a
shortfall

03:47:13.610 --> 03:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
shortfall
 
03:47:16.010 --> 03:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
then the program will be terminated
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
and that Liquor Commission fund that's
 
03:47:21.229 --> 03:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
literally the the liquor commission's
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
budget so unless the Liquor Commission
 
03:47:25.070 --> 03:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
goes bankrupt which would indicate that
 
03:47:27.229 --> 03:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is in very
 
03:47:29.090 --> 03:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
Dire Straits and probably the entire
 
03:47:32.570 --> 03:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
country's economy is in shambles
 
03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know the the program there is no
 
03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
safety valve for that program to be
 
03:47:38.100 --> 03:47:38.690 align:start position:0%
safety valve for that program to be
um

03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:41.929 --> 03:47:41.939 align:start position:0%
you know responsibly
 
03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
terminated so the language that was
 
03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in there to protect it is
 
03:47:49.370 --> 03:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
not here in the statute and if it's
 
03:47:51.530 --> 03:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
somewhere in chapter law
 
03:47:51.540 --> 03:47:52.550 align:start position:0%
somewhere in chapter law
um

03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
I was not able to find it
 
03:47:56.750 --> 03:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
so to me it looks like we don't have
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
that protection and that's a big problem
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
for me because the federal government
 
03:48:04.490 --> 03:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
the Congressional budget office has
 
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
stated that they it recommends that the
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
that Congress increased the Medicaid
 
03:48:17.150 --> 03:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
rates decrease I'm sorry
 
03:48:21.830 --> 03:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
increase the state portion of Medicaid
 
03:48:23.690 --> 03:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
so they'll be looking for us to pay a
 
03:48:25.849 --> 03:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
bigger share of this eventually and if
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
they change it
 
03:48:29.330 --> 03:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
it looks to me that there is no Clause
 
03:48:31.490 --> 03:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
here that allows us to back out of the
 
03:48:33.410 --> 03:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
program without taking on that extra
 
03:48:35.330 --> 03:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility that we didn't
 
03:48:36.590 --> 03:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
agree to
 
03:48:39.309 --> 03:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
so I would like to see that changed
 
03:48:41.690 --> 03:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
there are issues
 
03:48:44.330 --> 03:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
with this commission and
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
um you know the way that this is funded
 
03:48:50.870 --> 03:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
I don't see it going into the budget in
 
03:48:52.729 --> 03:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
hb2 there's some language that it will
 
03:48:54.670 --> 03:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
be in the budget
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
going forward so that
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
um it can be looked at like everything
 
03:49:02.090 --> 03:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
else I'm just going to bring up the
 
03:49:05.150 --> 03:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
language specifically but this is this
 
03:49:07.550 --> 03:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
is missing from this bill so I'd like to
 
03:49:10.729 --> 03:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
see what's in hb2 go forward we retain
 
03:49:13.010 --> 03:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
this maybe we add
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
um add that clause and fix some of these
 
03:49:17.630 --> 03:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
other issues first
 
03:49:19.309 --> 03:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
um but that language that I'm talking
 
03:49:19.319 --> 03:49:20.870 align:start position:0%
um but that language that I'm talking
about

03:49:20.870 --> 03:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:24.349 align:start position:0%
about
States

03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:24.359 --> 03:49:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:49:24.950 --> 03:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:24.960 --> 03:49:29.290 align:start position:0%
um
sorry

03:49:29.290 --> 03:49:29.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:32.570 --> 03:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to come up now
 
03:49:34.969 --> 03:49:34.979 align:start position:0%
well it basically it doesn't go through
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
the normal budget process so we want it
 
03:49:38.750 --> 03:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
03:49:38.760 --> 03:49:41.030 align:start position:0%
to do that
um

03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:47.090 --> 03:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:52.010 --> 03:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:57.950 --> 03:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:59.690 --> 03:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
um the work requirement so we've seen
 
03:50:01.630 --> 03:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
that there's been some movement on that
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
Georgia has now managed to get a work
 
03:50:06.370 --> 03:50:06.380 align:start position:0%
requirement for Medicaid in their state
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
the details of which I have not had the
 
03:50:12.590 --> 03:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
chance to thoroughly dive into but I
 
03:50:14.690 --> 03:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
think that we sh there is an opportunity
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
here and that we should be
 
03:50:16.800 --> 03:50:18.050 align:start position:0%
here and that we should be
um

03:50:18.050 --> 03:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
requiring the commissioner to submit a
 
03:50:23.690 --> 03:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
request for approval of our community
 
03:50:25.190 --> 03:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
engagement requirements that are in
 
03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:26.090 align:start position:0%
engagement requirements that are in
statute

03:50:26.090 --> 03:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:50:28.130 --> 03:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
these are things that make the program
 
03:50:31.389 --> 03:50:31.399 align:start position:0%
tailored to the values of New Hampshire
 
03:50:33.769 --> 03:50:33.779 align:start position:0%
you know we want those protections for
 
03:50:37.010 --> 03:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we want to keep a
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility aspect in this program
 
03:50:42.530 --> 03:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
and if we can do that the New Hampshire
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
way it should be done that way we don't
 
03:50:46.849 --> 03:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
do things like every other state we do
 
03:50:48.110 --> 03:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
it our way
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have the New Hampshire
 
03:50:49.560 --> 03:50:51.290 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have the New Hampshire
advantage

03:50:51.290 --> 03:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
there are other other issues that um I
 
03:50:55.849 --> 03:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
can touch on as things as things move
 
03:50:58.490 --> 03:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
forward but the bottom line is there are
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of holes there's a lot of room for
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
reform and I don't think that we should
 
03:51:04.910 --> 03:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
be making the perm the program as it
 
03:51:08.210 --> 03:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
currently is permanent I think the
 
03:51:10.190 --> 03:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
two-year Sunset
 
03:51:13.190 --> 03:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
um is perfectly reasonable and is enough
 
03:51:15.050 --> 03:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
time for
 
03:51:15.060 --> 03:51:15.710 align:start position:0%
time for
um

03:51:15.710 --> 03:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:18.769 --> 03:51:18.779 align:start position:0%
people to come together with now we have
 
03:51:21.530 --> 03:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of great ideas and a good jump off
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
point to make this program tailored to
 
03:51:26.809 --> 03:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
our values here in the state thank you
 
03:51:28.670 --> 03:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
03:51:32.929 --> 03:51:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:34.729 --> 03:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
I will be voting also to
 
03:51:41.090 --> 03:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
not support retention of the bill
 
03:51:43.190 --> 03:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
I think I could speak to a couple of
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
concerns that I heard one is about the
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
budgetary process my understanding is
 
03:51:48.229 --> 03:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
probably going to go to finance so the
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
airport it's an appropriate way to be
 
03:51:50.990 --> 03:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
vetted through the finance which is a
 
03:51:52.790 --> 03:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
budgetary process
 
03:51:54.830 --> 03:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
I do support representative King's
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
comment it's a popular program
 
03:51:58.190 --> 03:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
but the next question why is it popular
 
03:52:00.469 --> 03:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
because it actually helps a lot of
 
03:52:02.210 --> 03:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
people and I heard from the business
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
Community it helps them as well bringing
 
03:52:07.309 --> 03:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
down premiums and if you're looking at
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways to encourage
 
03:52:11.450 --> 03:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
employers to offer health insurance one
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
of the ways to do that is to bring down
 
03:52:14.210 --> 03:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
the premium costs because they can
 
03:52:15.290 --> 03:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
afford to give it to their employees
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
without having high deductibles
 
03:52:19.610 --> 03:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
I do want to bring out the fact that in
 
03:52:23.090 --> 03:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County which I do have here in
 
03:52:25.610 --> 03:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
front of me in Claremont and Croydon by
 
03:52:27.950 --> 03:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
itself is over 1700 people that are
 
03:52:29.809 --> 03:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
benefiting from this program
 
03:52:32.450 --> 03:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
also within Sullivan County with 60
 
03:52:34.849 --> 03:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
million dollars added to the Coopers of
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
providers and so forth I do understand
 
03:52:38.389 --> 03:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
what representative Palmer's coming from
 
03:52:40.370 --> 03:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
we have a very precarious situation
 
03:52:42.410 --> 03:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
right now after covid with a lot of the
 
03:52:43.910 --> 03:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals are struggling they are
 
03:52:46.610 --> 03:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
literally on the edge of going under
 
03:52:48.410 --> 03:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
if we don't find a way to help them
 
03:52:50.929 --> 03:52:50.939 align:start position:0%
because ultimately they still get care
 
03:52:52.849 --> 03:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
folks they just show up at the emergency
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
room which is uncompensated care
 
03:52:57.889 --> 03:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
or rely upon the providers to provide
 
03:53:00.650 --> 03:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care to them as well what
 
03:53:04.010 --> 03:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
that creates is a pent up demand because
 
03:53:05.510 --> 03:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
we don't take care of things early on
 
03:53:07.610 --> 03:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
the old adage of penny
 
03:53:07.620 --> 03:53:08.450 align:start position:0%
the old adage of penny
uh

03:53:08.450 --> 03:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:53:09.830 --> 03:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
announcement prevention is worth a pound
 
03:53:11.929 --> 03:53:11.939 align:start position:0%
of cure and I think the same thing goes
 
03:53:13.190 --> 03:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
through here that we have to be sure
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
that patients fundamentally have the
 
03:53:15.359 --> 03:53:16.490 align:start position:0%
that patients fundamentally have the
opportunity

03:53:16.490 --> 03:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
to get the preventative care they need
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
to keep the costs from getting out of
 
03:53:22.969 --> 03:53:22.979 align:start position:0%
control so for all those reasons I will
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
be voting against retention of the bill
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
also but if I can
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
the question about working on this over
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
the next two or three years and
 
03:53:32.030 --> 03:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
retaining it that's the role of the
 
03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
commission I mean the commission is
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
being created to fundamentally help
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
guide future legislation so if that
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
commission is doing what it's supposed
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
to do which I think it will
 
03:53:43.969 --> 03:53:43.979 align:start position:0%
it's going to help guide our legislative
 
03:53:47.710 --> 03:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
policy to make sound judgment
 
03:53:50.030 --> 03:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
legislatively going forward so
 
03:53:51.650 --> 03:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Leon I hear what your
 
03:53:54.050 --> 03:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
concerns are but we don't need to delay
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
it we actually are putting something in
 
03:53:59.690 --> 03:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
place to help guide us in the future
 
03:54:01.610 --> 03:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
other other discussion representative
 
03:54:01.620 --> 03:54:03.290 align:start position:0%
other other discussion representative
Cushman

03:54:03.290 --> 03:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
Cushman
 
03:54:06.050 --> 03:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and um thank you
 
03:54:08.389 --> 03:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant because
 
03:54:08.399 --> 03:54:09.650 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant because
um you

03:54:09.650 --> 03:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
um you
 
03:54:11.750 --> 03:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
helped uh help me remember another point
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make
 
03:54:16.250 --> 03:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
um I understand that you know the Health
 
03:54:18.290 --> 03:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
Care system was facing uncompensated
 
03:54:18.300 --> 03:54:20.030 align:start position:0%
Care system was facing uncompensated
care

03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:54:23.150 --> 03:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
um and that one of the goals of Medicaid
 
03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
expansion was to help deal with that to
 
03:54:27.769 --> 03:54:27.779 align:start position:0%
help people get Primary Care before they
 
03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
have to go to the hospital
 
03:54:31.969 --> 03:54:31.979 align:start position:0%
um and you know reduce health care costs
 
03:54:33.889 --> 03:54:33.899 align:start position:0%
that way and you know a lot of people
 
03:54:35.450 --> 03:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
talk about the benefits of the program
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know we reduce costs here we've you
 
03:54:37.920 --> 03:54:39.889 align:start position:0%
you know we reduce costs here we've you
know

03:54:39.889 --> 03:54:39.899 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:54:42.110 --> 03:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
um you know this has improved but no one
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
really talks about the costs of the
 
03:54:47.750 --> 03:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
program compared to those benefits and
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know the mcos get a capitated rate
 
03:54:53.330 --> 03:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
um you know they get paid for every
 
03:54:56.030 --> 03:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
person who's on the Medicaid rolls and
 
03:55:00.290 --> 03:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
this program costs a lot of money and I
 
03:55:02.269 --> 03:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
would submit that it costs a lot more
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
money to run the program than the
 
03:55:07.429 --> 03:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care of all the hospitals
 
03:55:09.170 --> 03:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
each year
 
03:55:11.570 --> 03:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case then maybe this
 
03:55:13.250 --> 03:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
is not the most financially responsible
 
03:55:16.490 --> 03:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
way to do this and I think going back to
 
03:55:17.809 --> 03:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
my point about doing things the New
 
03:55:20.330 --> 03:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way that may be a voucher
 
03:55:23.150 --> 03:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
system for Primary Care for Indigent
 
03:55:28.790 --> 03:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
individuals or you know a Baseline
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's there's another way we could do
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
this not necessarily maybe Medicaid is
 
03:55:35.689 --> 03:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
the best way
 
03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
um but I think there's room for other
 
03:55:40.010 --> 03:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
ideas to deal with this that could be
 
03:55:42.769 --> 03:55:42.779 align:start position:0%
much more cost effective
 
03:55:44.750 --> 03:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
um and that could be tailored
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
to be run the way that I think you know
 
03:55:49.800 --> 03:55:50.510 align:start position:0%
to be run the way that I think you know
um

03:55:50.510 --> 03:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
historically New Hampshire residents
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
seem to like things to be very fiscally
 
03:55:57.590 --> 03:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
responsible and tailored
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
to how we do it here
 
03:56:02.689 --> 03:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's just you know bottom
 
03:56:06.170 --> 03:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
line if this is costing more then
 
03:56:09.349 --> 03:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
the cost um the uncompensated care that
 
03:56:11.330 --> 03:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
we were looking to cover or if it's
 
03:56:14.929 --> 03:56:14.939 align:start position:0%
costing more than you know a visit to a
 
03:56:16.910 --> 03:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
primary care doctor for each of the
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
people in this enrollment plan and you
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
know their health care needs then it
 
03:56:22.969 --> 03:56:22.979 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make sense and I think
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
that there is a better way to do this
 
03:56:25.910 --> 03:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that more more discussion definitely
 
03:56:27.950 --> 03:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
needs to take place and we shouldn't be
 
03:56:29.530 --> 03:56:29.540 align:start position:0%
making it permanent today thank you
 
03:56:31.250 --> 03:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon and then
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:38.510 --> 03:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:40.969 --> 03:56:40.979 align:start position:0%
I represent this small city of
 
03:56:43.370 --> 03:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
Somersworth a small town of Rollinsford
 
03:56:45.530 --> 03:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
and those people elected me to represent
 
03:56:47.870 --> 03:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
them and the overwhelming amount of mail
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
I've received associated with this bill
 
03:56:52.130 --> 03:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
is to pass it
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
you have to remember you have to think
 
03:56:56.590 --> 03:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
remember we have communities
 
03:57:00.050 --> 03:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
that are extremely low income that's a
 
03:57:02.330 --> 03:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
big challenge for us in Somersworth we
 
03:57:05.170 --> 03:57:05.180 align:start position:0%
have a lot of City
 
03:57:08.269 --> 03:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
supported housing right now and many of
 
03:57:10.910 --> 03:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
those people are on Medicaid we don't
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
have a whole lot of people making over
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
six figures and Somersworth or more
 
03:57:17.269 --> 03:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
relinsford or even in the high double
 
03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
digits you know it's it's
 
03:57:20.279 --> 03:57:20.990 align:start position:0%
digits you know it's it's
um

03:57:20.990 --> 03:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:22.490 --> 03:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's just a way of life in our
 
03:57:23.809 --> 03:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
communities we've got to help our
 
03:57:26.150 --> 03:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
community and and this bill will help
 
03:57:28.429 --> 03:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
our community thank you
 
03:57:29.809 --> 03:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer and then
 
03:57:32.929 --> 03:57:32.939 align:start position:0%
representative Leon so uh the the other
 
03:57:35.330 --> 03:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
thing about making significant changes
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
is program is the federal program and
 
03:57:42.170 --> 03:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
they're paying 90 of the bill and
 
03:57:44.150 --> 03:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
I run up against this all the time which
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
is that you want to fix something but
 
03:57:47.630 --> 03:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
you can't fix it at the state or local
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
level it's got to be fixed in Washington
 
03:57:50.750 --> 03:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the things that
 
03:57:52.910 --> 03:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman and Leon are
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
talking about need to be fixed there we
 
03:57:57.170 --> 03:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
can't we can't change a federal program
 
03:57:58.969 --> 03:57:58.979 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we can decide whether
 
03:58:01.250 --> 03:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
or not to take it but I think we have to
 
03:58:02.689 --> 03:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
realize that if we're going to take it
 
03:58:05.450 --> 03:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
we need to take it with its rules and
 
03:58:07.370 --> 03:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
try to adapt as much as we can within
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
what the federal government will allow
 
03:58:10.910 --> 03:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
but we we aren't going to be able to
 
03:58:13.910 --> 03:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
make this a New Hampshire program
 
03:58:16.070 --> 03:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
03:58:18.110 --> 03:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I think that one of the important
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
issues about having a sunset is keeping
 
03:58:24.290 --> 03:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
that pressure on DC and on the federal
 
03:58:26.809 --> 03:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
government to keep this as a program
 
03:58:28.490 --> 03:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
that is responsive to the needs of the
 
03:58:30.769 --> 03:58:30.779 align:start position:0%
states the more states that sign on in
 
03:58:33.170 --> 03:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
perpetuity the less pressure there is in
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
order to keep it focused and the less
 
03:58:38.210 --> 03:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
pressure there is in order to make sure
 
03:58:40.610 --> 03:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
that it stays that is intended intended
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
role as opposed to going for a big big
 
03:58:46.370 --> 03:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
scope Escape
 
03:58:48.769 --> 03:58:48.779 align:start position:0%
big change in scope I apologize I should
 
03:58:50.929 --> 03:58:50.939 align:start position:0%
have had more than coffee for lunch
 
03:58:53.510 --> 03:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the other parts that I did
 
03:58:55.189 --> 03:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
want to hit upon was the discussion
 
03:58:57.530 --> 03:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
about the commission so initially when
 
03:59:00.670 --> 03:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
the commission was created in 2018
 
03:59:03.650 --> 03:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
it had generally the same makeup however
 
03:59:05.570 --> 03:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
the only voting members of the committee
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
were the six legislative members and a
 
03:59:12.170 --> 03:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
quorum was four of those six legislative
 
03:59:15.170 --> 03:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
members now the voting members are three
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate three members of
 
03:59:18.769 --> 03:59:18.779 align:start position:0%

drug abuse prevention treatment or
 
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
recovery and designee and I believe that
 
04:00:14.210 --> 04:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
there's also some effort in order to
 
04:00:17.090 --> 04:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
include Josiah Bartlett Center and a
 
04:00:19.490 --> 04:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in this as well but when you
 
04:00:21.469 --> 04:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
look at this if everybody there is a
 
04:00:23.090 --> 04:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
voting member
 
04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of the groups that
 
04:00:28.550 --> 04:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
benefit directly from this and few of
 
04:00:30.250 --> 04:00:30.260 align:start position:0%
the groups that see the indirect harm
 
04:00:33.170 --> 04:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
this is a program that the more that
 
04:00:35.389 --> 04:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
it's expanded just about everybody who
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
is part of that commission they benefit
 
04:00:39.830 --> 04:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
and I was an analyst on Wall Street of
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
course you act in your own interest in
 
04:00:42.769 --> 04:00:42.779 align:start position:0%
the interest of those people you
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
represent now I I don't I don't uh
 
04:00:49.250 --> 04:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it's a negative that
 
04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
people are advocating effectively for
 
04:00:53.150 --> 04:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
those people who they represent but I
 
04:00:55.010 --> 04:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
believe as a legislature we need to make
 
04:00:57.170 --> 04:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
sure that we aren't creating commissions
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
that are stacked for one outcome as
 
04:01:02.510 --> 04:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to being able to look at both
 
04:01:04.250 --> 04:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
the benefits the risks and more
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
specifically how we can craft craft
 
04:01:09.710 --> 04:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
legislation to be more New Hampshire
 
04:01:12.290 --> 04:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
specific through the waiver program that
 
04:01:14.450 --> 04:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
does exist and is used robustly in the
 
04:01:14.460 --> 04:01:16.250 align:start position:0%
does exist and is used robustly in the
state

04:01:16.250 --> 04:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:01:18.650 --> 04:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
I'll probably ask you to come back I
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
might wander if I get to my next topic
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:01:27.410 --> 04:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
I would just like to say that I don't
 
04:01:29.030 --> 04:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna any of us are going to
 
04:01:30.830 --> 04:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
convince any of the rest of us about
 
04:01:34.729 --> 04:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
whether this is a good idea or not and I
 
04:01:38.269 --> 04:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
would implore our committee
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
representative land
 
04:01:49.849 --> 04:01:49.859 align:start position:0%
I think that without addressing the
 
04:01:52.189 --> 04:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
significant underlying programs we miss
 
04:01:55.309 --> 04:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
a very large opportunity in order to see
 
04:01:58.010 --> 04:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
what can and should be improved for one
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
thing here we have in statutes a
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
reduction of poly Pharmacy resulting in
 
04:02:05.389 --> 04:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
drug interaction harm as part of the
 
04:02:07.610 --> 04:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage program we see
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
significant harm from polypharmacy a lot
 
04:02:13.610 --> 04:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
of the the mass Shooters are on
 
04:02:16.070 --> 04:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
polypharmacy we need to understand how
 
04:02:17.330 --> 04:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
much that's happening within our
 
04:02:19.969 --> 04:02:19.979 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system and so that we can at
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
least have a subset of data and
 
04:02:24.410 --> 04:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
understand what risks we may be
 
04:02:26.450 --> 04:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
encountering as an analyst I Look to
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
Sweden and they had a lot of great
 
04:02:29.870 --> 04:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
population level data which let us get
 
04:02:31.790 --> 04:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
an idea of Trends the way things worked
 
04:02:34.189 --> 04:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
and what we could see but we need to
 
04:02:36.530 --> 04:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
make sure that also with cardiac drugs
 
04:02:37.969 --> 04:02:37.979 align:start position:0%
you can be a dog chasing your tail
 
04:02:39.710 --> 04:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
because you add one after another and
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
another you increase the side effects
 
04:02:42.889 --> 04:02:42.899 align:start position:0%
you increase the cost of the system
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
without necessarily increasing the
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
benefit to the patient that's the sort
 
04:02:47.929 --> 04:02:47.939 align:start position:0%
of thing that we can do do something
 
04:02:49.370 --> 04:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
about here in New Hampshire with
 
04:02:51.410 --> 04:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
crafting our specific legislation sorry
 
04:02:55.090 --> 04:02:55.100 align:start position:0%
that was RSA 126 double a colon 2
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
1g1e sorry I can pass this around so
 
04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
that you can see it but this is just one
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
of those and also we were speaking to
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
the benefits of of having preventative
 
04:03:05.399 --> 04:03:06.229 align:start position:0%
the benefits of of having preventative
care

04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
right now we don't require an annual
 
04:03:09.710 --> 04:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
Wellness visit for somebody to
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
participate in this program if the whole
 
04:03:14.389 --> 04:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
point is to get care early shouldn't an
 
04:03:16.729 --> 04:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
annual Wellness visit be can one of the
 
04:03:19.130 --> 04:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
conditions for continued coverage I
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
would argue that if we're trying to get
 
04:03:23.210 --> 04:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
ahead of medical catastrophe it should
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
be so that is sorry
 
04:03:30.769 --> 04:03:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:33.410 --> 04:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
I think this is what's going here yes
 
04:03:37.250 --> 04:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:39.410 --> 04:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
so this is just one area where we could
 
04:03:41.330 --> 04:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
make a difference and improve this and
 
04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
improve the quality of care improve
 
04:03:43.680 --> 04:03:45.410 align:start position:0%
improve the quality of care improve
outcomes

04:03:45.410 --> 04:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
and improve things
 
04:03:49.969 --> 04:03:49.979 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:03:53.090 --> 04:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative weren't we it
 
04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
seems that a representative Leon is
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
introducing an amendment and I thought
 
04:04:01.550 --> 04:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
we were in voting mode
 
04:04:04.610 --> 04:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh well she didn't make any motion so
 
04:04:07.010 --> 04:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking she yeah I believe she did
 
04:04:09.650 --> 04:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
did you I'm sorry yes I had moved to
 
04:04:11.570 --> 04:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
retain and part of my reason for
 
04:04:14.150 --> 04:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
retaining is all of the massive changes
 
04:04:15.950 --> 04:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
that we should I understand but I just
 
04:04:17.809 --> 04:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
thought if we're in voting mode I would
 
04:04:20.689 --> 04:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
like to vote and then if we're going to
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
be in Amendment mode we can be in
 
04:04:25.630 --> 04:04:25.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment mode
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
I believe we're in discussion mode after
 
04:04:30.650 --> 04:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
the motion I believe you just introduced
 
04:04:32.330 --> 04:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
04:04:34.130 --> 04:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
you can pass that back that was for
 
04:04:36.110 --> 04:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
discussion purposes to highlight how we
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
can make one specific change to the law
 
04:04:40.849 --> 04:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
that we have in New Hampshire where
 
04:04:42.830 --> 04:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
we're able to do some things but not all
 
04:04:45.410 --> 04:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
so that was as an example I apologize we
 
04:04:46.849 --> 04:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
can pass those back if you would like I
 
04:04:49.370 --> 04:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
was just trying to be helpful
 
04:04:51.530 --> 04:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
that's how I interpreted it as it was
 
04:04:53.090 --> 04:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
just in support of her motion that she
 
04:04:56.570 --> 04:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
had distributed that so but um we don't
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't want to money to
 
04:04:59.809 --> 04:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
these Waters anymore so representative
 
04:04:59.819 --> 04:05:01.670 align:start position:0%
these Waters anymore so representative
Merchant

04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
it's more of a comment than a discussion
 
04:05:04.199 --> 04:05:05.090 align:start position:0%
it's more of a comment than a discussion
but

04:05:05.090 --> 04:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:05:06.889 --> 04:05:06.899 align:start position:0%
regardless which way we go with this if
 
04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
we do end up passing this bill I do
 
04:05:10.610 --> 04:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
recommend highly
 
04:05:13.070 --> 04:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
that we Advocate to the speaker that
 
04:05:14.750 --> 04:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
grabs the delay on be one of the
 
04:05:16.189 --> 04:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
representatives that's pointed to the
 
04:05:18.170 --> 04:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
commission she has a lot of valuable
 
04:05:19.550 --> 04:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
insight and knowledge I think it'd be
 
04:05:22.370 --> 04:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
very valuable for that Commission
 
04:05:27.530 --> 04:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.130 --> 04:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.140 --> 04:05:32.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:05:32.210 --> 04:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:34.969 --> 04:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
you know I I suspect we know how this
 
04:05:37.729 --> 04:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
motion might well go
 
04:05:40.010 --> 04:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
um 10 10 probably
 
04:05:41.809 --> 04:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
and says I suspect that's going to be
 
04:05:43.729 --> 04:05:43.739 align:start position:0%
two of almost any motion that's made on
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
this bill today
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue two other bills
 
04:05:51.170 --> 04:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.180 --> 04:05:55.790 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:05:55.790 --> 04:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I think that
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
we've um you know if we haven't had the
 
04:06:02.450 --> 04:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
last five years to think about this
 
04:06:04.610 --> 04:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
we've certainly had
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
um the last few months to think about
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
this and to hear testimony and to talk
 
04:06:12.290 --> 04:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
among our own caucus I'm sure the
 
04:06:14.090 --> 04:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
Republicans have talked among their own
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
caucus I think that
 
04:06:16.080 --> 04:06:16.370 align:start position:0%
caucus I think that
[Music]

04:06:16.370 --> 04:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:06:16.380 --> 04:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:20.570 --> 04:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
I think we probably have very different
 
04:06:20.580 --> 04:06:22.370 align:start position:0%
I think we probably have very different
opinions

04:06:22.370 --> 04:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
04:06:24.429 --> 04:06:24.439 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think that we're gonna
 
04:06:26.809 --> 04:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
make things we're going to improve
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
things by taking more time
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
I think we're
 
04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm only speaking for myself
 
04:06:37.729 --> 04:06:37.739 align:start position:0%
but I'm ready to vote on this and if
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
this doesn't pass
 
04:06:42.110 --> 04:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
on various amendments that people have
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:54.370 --> 04:06:54.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
I could withdraw my motion
 
04:06:58.910 --> 04:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
um if it looks like this is going to be
 
04:07:00.590 --> 04:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
deadlocked I thought that I thought that
 
04:07:01.849 --> 04:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
it would be pretty clear that we had
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
more work to do but I'm going to
 
04:07:06.410 --> 04:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay so there is no motion on the floor
 
04:07:09.840 --> 04:07:10.689 align:start position:0%
okay so there is no motion on the floor
um

04:07:10.689 --> 04:07:10.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:13.250 --> 04:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
first I made a second should we draw two
 
04:07:13.260 --> 04:07:16.429 align:start position:0%
first I made a second should we draw two
yep

04:07:16.429 --> 04:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:18.969 --> 04:07:18.979 align:start position:0%
may be recognized for emotion
 
04:07:23.330 --> 04:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman yes yes go ahead
 
04:07:23.340 --> 04:07:24.050 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman yes yes go ahead
um

04:07:24.050 --> 04:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:31.070 --> 04:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
I move that we pass
 
04:07:39.170 --> 04:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
Amendment one six two two
 
04:07:42.530 --> 04:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
um to SB 263 and I will pass that around
 
04:07:59.990 --> 04:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:00.000 --> 04:08:11.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:08:11.050 --> 04:08:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:14.650 --> 04:08:14.660 align:start position:0%
was there a second to that motion
 
04:08:16.370 --> 04:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
representative Leon seconds
 
04:08:18.050 --> 04:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman do you want to
 
04:08:20.269 --> 04:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you so
 
04:08:23.090 --> 04:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
going back to that discussion and that
 
04:08:25.969 --> 04:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
um paper that I passed out to everybody
 
04:08:25.979 --> 04:08:26.710 align:start position:0%
um paper that I passed out to everybody
um

04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:29.809 --> 04:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
that you have about the evolution of
 
04:08:36.229 --> 04:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
this section of rsa126 double A
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
um where it speaks to the federal match
 
04:08:43.250 --> 04:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
rate and if that goes below 90 percent
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
um that that's not in statute anywhere
 
04:08:48.530 --> 04:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
um so I would like to see that in the
 
04:08:52.370 --> 04:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
rsas that govern this program and so the
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
amendment you have before you does just
 
04:08:54.239 --> 04:08:55.969 align:start position:0%
amendment you have before you does just
that

04:08:55.969 --> 04:08:55.979 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:58.969 --> 04:08:58.979 align:start position:0%
um it puts in that if the fat you'll see
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
on line 13 if the federal match rate
 
04:09:03.170 --> 04:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
applied to the program Falls below 90
 
04:09:03.180 --> 04:09:04.070 align:start position:0%
applied to the program Falls below 90
percent

04:09:04.070 --> 04:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:09:08.630 --> 04:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
RSA 126 colon double a shall be repealed
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
180 days after the rate change occurs
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
and that the commissioner within 48
 
04:09:15.530 --> 04:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
Hours of the rate change shall notify
 
04:09:17.450 --> 04:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
the governor the Speaker of the House of
 
04:09:18.769 --> 04:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
Representatives the president of the
 
04:09:20.330 --> 04:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
Senate and the chairperson of the fiscal
 
04:09:22.849 --> 04:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
Committee of the general court Secretary
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
of State and the director of legislative
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
Services of the program's pending
 
04:09:28.610 --> 04:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
termination and within 10 business days
 
04:09:30.110 --> 04:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
of the rate change notify program
 
04:09:32.030 --> 04:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
participants of the program's pending
 
04:09:32.040 --> 04:09:33.229 align:start position:0%
participants of the program's pending
termination

04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
termination
 
04:09:36.170 --> 04:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
so this just goes back to if if we are
 
04:09:38.090 --> 04:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
touting this program as having these
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayer protections we better make sure
 
04:09:43.610 --> 04:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
that they actually are in place and that
 
04:09:46.490 --> 04:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
they are in the RSA and easily able to
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
be found and are very clear in common
 
04:09:49.680 --> 04:09:52.490 align:start position:0%
be found and are very clear in common
language

04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:09:57.290 --> 04:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the bill on line five
 
04:10:00.349 --> 04:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
um it's just talking about when when
 
04:10:04.150 --> 04:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:06.710 --> 04:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative South King thank you Mr
 
04:10:08.570 --> 04:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
chair question for you representative
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
04:10:12.830 --> 04:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
um is it your understanding that if this
 
04:10:16.490 --> 04:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
provision were not in the bill and there
 
04:10:19.130 --> 04:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
were some sort of you know deadlock in
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
spending from Congress or whatever and
 
04:10:23.090 --> 04:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
the federal government didn't pay their
 
04:10:24.889 --> 04:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
90 share that the
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
that the the state as it currently
 
04:10:28.849 --> 04:10:28.859 align:start position:0%
stands would pick up the hundred percent
 
04:10:29.809 --> 04:10:29.819 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:10:32.510 --> 04:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's my unders my understanding is
 
04:10:34.969 --> 04:10:34.979 align:start position:0%
that we would have to because as of
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
right now the the 10 and 90 percent is
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
not anywhere in statute at all okay and
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
then my other question would be for
 
04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else that could show me
 
04:10:46.490 --> 04:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
otherwise if if representative Cushman
 
04:10:49.370 --> 04:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
is incorrect I'd I'd like to see um I'd
 
04:10:52.010 --> 04:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
like to see proof of that thank you
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy did you hand up oh
 
04:10:55.429 --> 04:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
another discussion on this amendment
 
04:10:59.630 --> 04:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um I I'm
 
04:11:03.290 --> 04:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
looking to find the specific things but
 
04:11:05.630 --> 04:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
was your request your request to OLS was
 
04:11:07.370 --> 04:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
to place this within the statutes into
 
04:11:10.429 --> 04:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
the rsas is that correct uh they
 
04:11:12.889 --> 04:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
actually they left this in chapter law
 
04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
so this would need to go into chapter
 
04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
law um I fully support moving
 
04:11:20.590 --> 04:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
um the language from chapter law in 2018
 
04:11:24.650 --> 04:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
into 126 double A because I think that
 
04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
without that we're legislators we've
 
04:11:28.250 --> 04:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
been trying to track this down for a
 
04:11:29.870 --> 04:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
while with the help of OLS and it's
 
04:11:31.910 --> 04:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
still been challenging thank you and
 
04:11:31.920 --> 04:11:33.290 align:start position:0%
still been challenging thank you and
that's

04:11:33.290 --> 04:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for pointing that out
 
04:11:37.610 --> 04:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
because I specifically asked for them to
 
04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
create a new section seven after section
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
six in that RSA so I expected that it
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
was going to be in the right place but I
 
04:11:46.969 --> 04:11:46.979 align:start position:0%
I didn't catch that so thank you for
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
catching that
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:11:53.809 --> 04:11:53.819 align:start position:0%
uh well I'm sorry Mr representative
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
Merchant just a point of water I'm
 
04:11:56.750 --> 04:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
trying to go through the RSA that's
 
04:11:58.610 --> 04:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
being referenced here
 
04:12:03.229 --> 04:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
are we trying to change RSA 342 colon 25
 
04:12:05.570 --> 04:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
may I respond sure go ahead um
 
04:12:07.070 --> 04:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant so that's
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
chapter law and that's
 
04:12:09.479 --> 04:12:10.610 align:start position:0%
chapter law and that's
um

04:12:10.610 --> 04:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:12:14.809 --> 04:12:14.819 align:start position:0%
that is not what I was trying to do I
 
04:12:18.889 --> 04:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
was trying to put it in RSA 126 colon a
 
04:12:18.899 --> 04:12:20.150 align:start position:0%
was trying to put it in RSA 126 colon a
a

04:12:20.150 --> 04:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:12:22.870 --> 04:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
126-aa colon 3
 
04:12:30.530 --> 04:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
and it would be a new section Roman 7.
 
04:12:32.150 --> 04:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
is this amendment ready for us to
 
04:12:34.550 --> 04:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
consider uh well well now that we've
 
04:12:36.110 --> 04:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
pointed out that it's it's still not
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
putting it in the RSA no it is not I
 
04:12:40.610 --> 04:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
would need all this it's true according
 
04:12:42.590 --> 04:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
to what I'm saying it says grading and
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
which is three four two right they're
 
04:12:54.729 --> 04:12:54.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.110 --> 04:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
04:12:57.120 --> 04:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
okay

04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:59.760 --> 04:13:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:01.680 --> 04:13:02.809 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:13:02.809 --> 04:13:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it looks like that this
 
04:13:06.650 --> 04:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
amendment is not ready for us to
 
04:13:08.630 --> 04:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
introduce and this just furthers the
 
04:13:10.189 --> 04:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
point why I think that we need to retain
 
04:13:11.689 --> 04:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
this so that we can make sure that we
 
04:13:14.570 --> 04:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
have the Amendments all back from OLS as
 
04:13:17.809 --> 04:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
they as we would like them to be we need
 
04:13:19.250 --> 04:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time to go through
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
these things I think this is a really
 
04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
important piece of this legislation if
 
04:13:25.610 --> 04:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's going to go forward so I would ask
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
the committee if
 
04:13:29.450 --> 04:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
um if we can't do this now we could
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
attend to other amendments
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
um but I would like to have a chance to
 
04:13:34.849 --> 04:13:34.859 align:start position:0%
go back to wallows and have them fix
 
04:13:34.859 --> 04:13:35.889 align:start position:0%
go back to wallows and have them fix
this

04:13:35.889 --> 04:13:35.899 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
with borrowing your motion then
 
04:13:41.929 --> 04:13:41.939 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll withdraw my emotion
 
04:13:45.110 --> 04:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
I'll withdraw my second okay and then um
 
04:13:46.910 --> 04:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
if I could be recognized for emotional
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
sure representative land um thank you Mr
 
04:13:50.750 --> 04:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um since I had already passed
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
it out it seems inappropriate time
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
um to uh move that we adopt amendment
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
1494h to send a bill to 63 FM
 
04:14:05.689 --> 04:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:08.330 --> 04:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri seconds you wish
 
04:14:10.010 --> 04:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion uh yes thank you
 
04:14:12.349 --> 04:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh
 
04:14:12.359 --> 04:14:13.990 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh
that

04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
would you keep yours up for that
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:24.889 --> 04:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
um thank you so there's already existing
 
04:14:26.929 --> 04:14:26.939 align:start position:0%
law within the the different programs
 
04:14:29.769 --> 04:14:29.779 align:start position:0%
here if I can uh get to this section in
 
04:14:32.689 --> 04:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
126a so I can tell you what this first
 
04:14:38.349 --> 04:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.170 --> 04:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
in section 2 G which 2G is the
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall include an MCO
 
04:14:52.490 --> 04:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
contracts with the state clinically and
 
04:14:54.530 --> 04:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
actually sound incentives designed to
 
04:14:57.410 --> 04:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
improve Care Quality and utilization and
 
04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
to lower the total cost within the
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Managed Care Program this
 
04:15:03.110 --> 04:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall also include in the
 
04:15:05.150 --> 04:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
MCO contract provisions and obligation
 
04:15:07.010 --> 04:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
for the MCO to include provider
 
04:15:09.790 --> 04:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
alignment assistance to leverage and so
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
initial areas to improve Care Quality
 
04:15:14.689 --> 04:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
and utilization and to lower the total
 
04:15:16.490 --> 04:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
cost of care may include but are not
 
04:15:18.650 --> 04:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
limited to and that's where we get to
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
the section A that currently says
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
reduction in poly Pharmacy resulting in
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
drug interaction harm this is a very
 
04:15:27.469 --> 04:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
good opportunity for us to look at a
 
04:15:29.630 --> 04:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
subset of people and see what
 
04:15:32.150 --> 04:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
polypharmacy issues we have this would
 
04:15:34.729 --> 04:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
be a chance to see who is on you know
 
04:15:36.769 --> 04:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
statins and then other drugs that may or
 
04:15:39.170 --> 04:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
may not be working towards the same goal
 
04:15:41.570 --> 04:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
we may be looking at people that have
 
04:15:43.849 --> 04:15:43.859 align:start position:0%
have multiple different
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
um different um psychiatric drugs and
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
also looking at Cross reactions across
 
04:15:53.450 --> 04:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
other ones this is an issue that that
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with with colleagues about
 
04:15:57.950 --> 04:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
and polypharmacy is is a clear and
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
present issue it increases the cost of
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
care it can decrease outcomes and this
 
04:16:06.050 --> 04:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
would be responsible to include that in
 
04:16:09.110 --> 04:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
the contracts with the mcos the second
 
04:16:10.990 --> 04:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
one is another one based around
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
improving outcomes so in the RSA section
 
04:16:21.530 --> 04:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
that chapter starts off
 
04:16:25.729 --> 04:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
um actually that is the whole paragraph
 
04:16:27.769 --> 04:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
there for any person determined to be
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
eligible and who is enrolled in the
 
04:16:31.490 --> 04:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
program the MCO shall support an
 
04:16:33.290 --> 04:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
individual to arrange a wellness visit
 
04:16:35.689 --> 04:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
with his or her primary care and then it
 
04:16:38.090 --> 04:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
has what the wellness visit includes if
 
04:16:40.969 --> 04:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
the whole point of of having met having
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
this coverage available to people is to
 
04:16:46.670 --> 04:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
get earlier treatment annual visits are
 
04:16:48.410 --> 04:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
a very very good step towards that
 
04:16:50.210 --> 04:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
because that's our first our chance to
 
04:16:51.710 --> 04:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
do screening this is our chance to
 
04:16:53.570 --> 04:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
intervene before somebody is showing up
 
04:16:55.849 --> 04:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
in an emergency room if we're looking to
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
provide care earlier then annual visits
 
04:17:01.130 --> 04:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
are important and this also adds the
 
04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
language the annual Wellness visit
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
she'll check for poly Pharmacy
 
04:17:05.689 --> 04:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
especially in the areas of Cardiology
 
04:17:07.610 --> 04:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
and mental health to avoid dangerous
 
04:17:10.130 --> 04:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
drug interactions and side effects
 
04:17:10.140 --> 04:17:10.790 align:start position:0%
drug interactions and side effects
um

04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
I recognize that providers have short
 
04:17:15.650 --> 04:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
time periods to visit with people but if
 
04:17:17.809 --> 04:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
we're looking and trying to reduce harm
 
04:17:20.450 --> 04:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
and to improve the quality of care I
 
04:17:21.769 --> 04:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
think that this is an important step
 
04:17:23.689 --> 04:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
because that way the people who are
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
using these benefits will use them and
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
we won't be paying that we won't be
 
04:17:29.450 --> 04:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
paying the rate for people who are not
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
interested to get an annual Wellness
 
04:17:33.650 --> 04:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
visit yet we're still paying on an
 
04:17:35.689 --> 04:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
annual basis for their care that they do
 
04:17:37.610 --> 04:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
not receive so this is a bit of a give
 
04:17:38.570 --> 04:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
and take
 
04:17:40.849 --> 04:17:40.859 align:start position:0%
you go to the doctor we still have this
 
04:17:42.650 --> 04:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
coverage and I think that that's
 
04:17:44.450 --> 04:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
reasonable when we're trying to get into
 
04:17:46.429 --> 04:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
preventative care and to stop Downstream
 
04:17:46.439 --> 04:17:48.590 align:start position:0%
preventative care and to stop Downstream
Harms

04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
Harms
 
04:17:50.929 --> 04:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:59.170 --> 04:17:59.180 align:start position:0%
um more like a comment I I want to thank
 
04:18:01.610 --> 04:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
representatively and you know for
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
bringing this amendment especially in
 
04:18:10.510 --> 04:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
terms of uh Alias of Cardiology
 
04:18:14.150 --> 04:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
Sciences uh evolving as a nation we are
 
04:18:17.870 --> 04:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
spending billions on drugs like statins
 
04:18:19.450 --> 04:18:19.460 align:start position:0%
but still
 
04:18:24.349 --> 04:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
Cardiology problems remain high not
 
04:18:28.370 --> 04:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
solved and often lead to death of
 
04:18:35.210 --> 04:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:39.189 --> 04:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
a popular Pharmacy and uh
 
04:18:41.889 --> 04:18:41.899 align:start position:0%
actual uh
 
04:18:47.710 --> 04:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
help or lack of it and side effects
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm very thankful for bringing us
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
04:18:56.809 --> 04:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
04:19:00.170 --> 04:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
so I completely thank you I completely
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
agree on the um the idea that
 
04:19:04.969 --> 04:19:04.979 align:start position:0%
polypharmacy is a huge problem and
 
04:19:07.250 --> 04:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
certainly a number of people I admit to
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
the hospital are in the hospital because
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:19:13.910 --> 04:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and I I the idea of an annual
 
04:19:15.530 --> 04:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
wellness exam the only question I'd have
 
04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
there is whether this is a particular
 
04:19:19.370 --> 04:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
program whether that would be covered
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
under the program like it is under
 
04:19:24.349 --> 04:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
Medicare but I the the idea is that's
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
that's great I think the reporting is
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
where I begin to have a problem if is it
 
04:19:31.849 --> 04:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
would be great if we're going to do a
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
reporting thing to have it across
 
04:19:37.070 --> 04:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere because if you have one
 
04:19:39.889 --> 04:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
particular group that's being asked
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
you're being asked to report on as a
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
physician in your office keeping track
 
04:19:45.110 --> 04:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
of that will would be uh sort of an
 
04:19:46.969 --> 04:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
impossible nightmare
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
um so that would be so I'm I'm not
 
04:19:52.130 --> 04:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
opposed to the idea I just don't know
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
how that would work because if if I see
 
04:19:57.769 --> 04:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
you know 15 patients 20 patients in a
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
day I don't necessarily know what
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
insurance they have and I don't know
 
04:20:01.439 --> 04:20:02.750 align:start position:0%
insurance they have and I don't know
what

04:20:02.750 --> 04:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:20:04.790 --> 04:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
and this is this has been a real problem
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
about trying to figure out
 
04:20:08.990 --> 04:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
which things to report on which things
 
04:20:12.290 --> 04:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
are important and then having all of the
 
04:20:15.229 --> 04:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
different payers agree and agencies
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
agree on which things and so I would
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
prefer to see that approached that way
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
as uh you know like
 
04:20:25.010 --> 04:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
um the ACO in Vermont has struggled with
 
04:20:26.929 --> 04:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
this but has come up with a thing where
 
04:20:28.849 --> 04:20:28.859 align:start position:0%
they've sort of tried to reduce it into
 
04:20:31.610 --> 04:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
one thing so you know if you're
 
04:20:33.469 --> 04:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
practicing in Vermont you you sort of
 
04:20:35.090 --> 04:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
know that you're going to be looking at
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
these 12 things rather than five things
 
04:20:39.050 --> 04:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
from one insurance and seven from
 
04:20:39.060 --> 04:20:42.830 align:start position:0%
from one insurance and seven from
another

04:20:42.830 --> 04:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
other uh representative Murphy thank you
 
04:20:48.410 --> 04:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
just a question clarification
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
um on line 18 the word support what is
 
04:20:54.050 --> 04:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
the intent of support is that arrange
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
for a visit pay for a visit
 
04:21:00.650 --> 04:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:02.150 --> 04:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you that's in the existing
 
04:21:05.450 --> 04:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
language and as yet one more example of
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
how the stat whole statute could use
 
04:21:11.210 --> 04:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
some good close attention
 
04:21:12.889 --> 04:21:12.899 align:start position:0%
but I agree it doesn't say whether it's
 
04:21:14.450 --> 04:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
paid for it doesn't say if you just send
 
04:21:16.670 --> 04:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
you a postcard to encourage it it
 
04:21:18.830 --> 04:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't say if you do some skywriting
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
and put an ad on the TV so it's uh and
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
we've seen some uh different Outreach I
 
04:21:26.330 --> 04:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
I could I could sew another El and
 
04:21:28.370 --> 04:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
skydive in with a 70-foot banner behind
 
04:21:31.429 --> 04:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
me but I'm a little out of practice
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
so I agree um that's a very vague term I
 
04:21:34.969 --> 04:21:34.979 align:start position:0%
hear the landing is going to be quite
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
quite dangerous and representative
 
04:21:37.319 --> 04:21:39.410 align:start position:0%
quite dangerous and representative
Merchant

04:21:39.410 --> 04:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
04:21:41.450 --> 04:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:21:43.490 --> 04:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
I do concur also with representative
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
Palmer uh polypharmacy is definitely an
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
issue particularly some of the elderly
 
04:21:50.510 --> 04:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
that we run into
 
04:21:52.610 --> 04:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
I would say that the appropriate place
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
to add reporting is not so much in the
 
04:21:56.450 --> 04:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
statute here but also in the
 
04:21:58.729 --> 04:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
commission's responsibilities and that's
 
04:22:00.889 --> 04:22:00.899 align:start position:0%
probably the logical place to add it if
 
04:22:03.410 --> 04:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
we want to add it number two as far as
 
04:22:05.809 --> 04:22:05.819 align:start position:0%
the annual Wellness visit
 
04:22:08.450 --> 04:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
um I totally agree with primary care but
 
04:22:11.150 --> 04:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
under Medicare versus Medicaid
 
04:22:13.370 --> 04:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
a wellness visit could be done by more
 
04:22:15.050 --> 04:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
than Primary Care it could also be done
 
04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
by a pharmacist because we do medication
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
therapy management constantly people who
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
are on poly Pharmacy are required to get
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
a visit by
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist if you will to check on
 
04:22:25.250 --> 04:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
the polypharmacy I think it's also a
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
place that we could add
 
04:22:28.729 --> 04:22:28.739 align:start position:0%
the role of the pharmacist in this
 
04:22:34.370 --> 04:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
capacity to help in that to identify
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
potential patients because patients with
 
04:22:39.229 --> 04:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
potential polypharmacy as well so for
 
04:22:41.630 --> 04:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
those reasons I think number one is
 
04:22:43.210 --> 04:22:43.220 align:start position:0%
it should be in the commission
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
responsibilities not in the statute per
 
04:22:47.450 --> 04:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
se here I think number two we should be
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
thinking about adding other individuals
 
04:22:51.050 --> 04:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
that have access to the patient record
 
04:22:55.849 --> 04:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:00.889 --> 04:23:00.899 align:start position:0%
representative lehan
 
04:23:02.689 --> 04:23:02.699 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
04:23:04.729 --> 04:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
um I think with that um it probably
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
would make sense for me to go back I
 
04:23:08.929 --> 04:23:08.939 align:start position:0%
guess is there support for me moving
 
04:23:10.969 --> 04:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
that to a commission responsibility to
 
04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
try and collect that information and
 
04:23:15.650 --> 04:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
then to recruit pharmacists looking at
 
04:23:17.809 --> 04:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
this having the annual Wellness knit
 
04:23:20.330 --> 04:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
check for that quite honestly if that
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
became standard practice for everybody's
 
04:23:23.630 --> 04:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
Wellness visit it would be a net
 
04:23:25.370 --> 04:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
positive for Everybody's Health in the
 
04:23:27.530 --> 04:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
state but if we had them getting that
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
information and included pharmacists are
 
04:23:31.849 --> 04:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
there any other care providers or does
 
04:23:33.650 --> 04:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
primary care provider cover everybody
 
04:23:35.689 --> 04:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
but pharmacists that would do a wellness
 
04:23:35.699 --> 04:23:37.450 align:start position:0%
but pharmacists that would do a wellness
visit

04:23:37.450 --> 04:23:37.460 align:start position:0%
visit
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant is there anybody
 
04:23:42.530 --> 04:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
else I should include no because most of
 
04:23:43.849 --> 04:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
the time we talk about Primary Care
 
04:23:46.189 --> 04:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
includes the physician PA or nurse
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
practitioner maybe even an actual path
 
04:23:49.729 --> 04:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't per se include the
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist that's why in the Medicare
 
04:23:53.389 --> 04:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
regulations it does include the
 
04:23:54.889 --> 04:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in that language
 
04:23:58.429 --> 04:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
I think thank you very much with that
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
I'll with I'll withdraw this amendment
 
04:24:01.729 --> 04:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
so that I can send it back for
 
04:24:01.739 --> 04:24:03.410 align:start position:0%
so that I can send it back for
improvement

04:24:03.410 --> 04:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
04:24:07.729 --> 04:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:10.429 --> 04:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
04:24:12.769 --> 04:24:12.779 align:start position:0%
that Amendment we will wait to hear more
 
04:24:14.330 --> 04:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
about I guess
 
04:24:15.889 --> 04:24:15.899 align:start position:0%
yep you're planning to bring that
 
04:24:17.929 --> 04:24:17.939 align:start position:0%
forward next next week
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have another
 
04:24:25.729 --> 04:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
amendment here uh this amendment is 1489
 
04:24:30.110 --> 04:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
H and I move that we pass it
 
04:24:34.969 --> 04:24:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:42.110 --> 04:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:44.150 --> 04:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so this amendment that's
 
04:24:48.050 --> 04:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
going around
 
04:24:52.610 --> 04:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
um would add in section two of that RSA
 
04:24:59.570 --> 04:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
126 AAA under Roman 2 subsection a
 
04:25:02.510 --> 04:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to add a fourth section to
 
04:25:04.729 --> 04:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
this there are some requirements under
 
04:25:07.610 --> 04:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
this under that part of the statute
 
04:25:09.650 --> 04:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
um to the extent Allowed by federal law
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
the individual shall so they provide
 
04:25:14.570 --> 04:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
necessary information for financial
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
eligibility they inform the department
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
of changes in their eligibility and at
 
04:25:19.849 --> 04:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
the time of enrollment they acknowledge
 
04:25:21.170 --> 04:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
that the program is subject to
 
04:25:24.590 --> 04:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
cancellation upon notice and
 
04:25:26.570 --> 04:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
um we going back to what we were just
 
04:25:26.580 --> 04:25:27.769 align:start position:0%
um we going back to what we were just
discussing

04:25:27.769 --> 04:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
04:25:27.779 --> 04:25:28.429 align:start position:0%
discussing
um

04:25:28.429 --> 04:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:31.130 --> 04:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
the mcos get a capitation rate for as
 
04:25:32.809 --> 04:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
many people are on the rolls so we are
 
04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
paying for as many people are on the
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
rolls whether they utilize the care or
 
04:25:39.110 --> 04:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
not and
 
04:25:41.870 --> 04:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
um so it would make sense that we would
 
04:25:44.210 --> 04:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
periodically go through those roles and
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
find out if there are anyone who is not
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
utilizing the program and if they're not
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
utilizing it well then they probably
 
04:25:54.050 --> 04:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
don't need to be a part of it and that
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
don't need the benefits and should be
 
04:25:58.849 --> 04:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
taken off the roles and that would be a
 
04:26:02.510 --> 04:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
responsible way to to operate so section
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
four says at the time of enrollment they
 
04:26:06.170 --> 04:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
shall acknowledge that an
 
04:26:08.210 --> 04:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
underutilization of benefits shall
 
04:26:09.950 --> 04:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
result in the termination of benefits
 
04:26:12.290 --> 04:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
upon annual re-verification and
 
04:26:14.809 --> 04:26:14.819 align:start position:0%
re-enrollment a minimum utilization of
 
04:26:16.250 --> 04:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
benefits for the purposes of this
 
04:26:18.290 --> 04:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
section shall be defined as one annual
 
04:26:20.090 --> 04:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
physical examination with a licensed
 
04:26:21.889 --> 04:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
primary care provider within one year
 
04:26:23.570 --> 04:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
from the date of enrollment or annual
 
04:26:23.580 --> 04:26:25.309 align:start position:0%
from the date of enrollment or annual
re-enrollment

04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
re-enrollment
 
04:26:27.429 --> 04:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll take any questions
 
04:26:29.570 --> 04:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
04:26:32.510 --> 04:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:26:32.520 --> 04:26:33.610 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
so

04:26:33.610 --> 04:26:33.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:35.689 --> 04:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
04:26:37.250 --> 04:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
I hear the concern about
 
04:26:39.290 --> 04:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
underutilization and paying for benefits
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
that are not being utilized
 
04:26:43.370 --> 04:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
I do consider myself on the other side
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the coin I'll be encouraging people
 
04:26:47.689 --> 04:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
to over utilize to the to prevent the
 
04:26:50.030 --> 04:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
underutilization so therefore we're
 
04:26:52.969 --> 04:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
trying to in some ways have unintended
 
04:26:54.830 --> 04:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
consequence where over utilization may
 
04:26:56.570 --> 04:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
be triggered as an unintended
 
04:26:58.070 --> 04:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
consequence to try to figure out how to
 
04:27:00.530 --> 04:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
tackle underutilization
 
04:27:03.229 --> 04:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question well there's
 
04:27:05.630 --> 04:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
no there's no definition of over
 
04:27:07.729 --> 04:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
utilization here it's just under
 
04:27:10.250 --> 04:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
utilization which is a very very low bar
 
04:27:12.050 --> 04:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
just says that you have to see your
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
primary care provider at least once a
 
04:27:14.159 --> 04:27:15.710 align:start position:0%
primary care provider at least once a
year

04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:27:18.410 --> 04:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
beyond that that's appropriate that's an
 
04:27:20.389 --> 04:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate level of utilization and if
 
04:27:22.130 --> 04:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
you go to your primary care provider and
 
04:27:23.570 --> 04:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
they find something and you need to
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
utilize further Services that's what the
 
04:27:28.010 --> 04:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
program is for
 
04:27:29.990 --> 04:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
04:27:32.689 --> 04:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I will vote
 
04:27:34.370 --> 04:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
against this amendment
 
04:27:34.380 --> 04:27:35.450 align:start position:0%
against this amendment
um

04:27:35.450 --> 04:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:35.460 --> 04:27:36.290 align:start position:0%
um
um

04:27:36.290 --> 04:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
I think people's lives are very
 
04:27:40.270 --> 04:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
complicated I think
 
04:27:40.280 --> 04:27:40.610 align:start position:0%
complicated I think
[Music]

04:27:40.610 --> 04:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:40.620 --> 04:27:41.510 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
04:27:46.849 --> 04:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
have limited resources their lives tend
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
to be more complicated and
 
04:27:52.969 --> 04:27:52.979 align:start position:0%
um in general if people are not
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
utilizing care
 
04:27:58.070 --> 04:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
um then there's no payment for services
 
04:28:00.050 --> 04:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
I understand that there would be a
 
04:28:03.410 --> 04:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
payment for capitation for the you know
 
04:28:05.809 --> 04:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
managed care I have no idea what that
 
04:28:07.729 --> 04:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
payment is what the difference would be
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
to the state for one person
 
04:28:14.210 --> 04:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
or 10 people who were taken off the
 
04:28:17.090 --> 04:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
roles because of underutilization but I
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
think people's lives tend to be very
 
04:28:22.130 --> 04:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
complicated and
 
04:28:24.410 --> 04:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
um people I know I don't go to the
 
04:28:26.689 --> 04:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
doctor when I don't have to and I don't
 
04:28:28.630 --> 04:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
go to the doctor when I'm feeling well
 
04:28:33.309 --> 04:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
and you know then something of you know
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
great significance could come up and I'm
 
04:28:38.330 --> 04:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
really appreciative of having care
 
04:28:40.250 --> 04:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
available and I think that that's what
 
04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
we're providing for people to have care
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
available so I will vote against this
 
04:28:45.000 --> 04:28:47.090 align:start position:0%
available so I will vote against this
amendment

04:28:47.090 --> 04:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:28:50.030 --> 04:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative Murphy and then
 
04:28:52.309 --> 04:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you I also
 
04:28:52.319 --> 04:28:53.210 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you I also
would

04:28:53.210 --> 04:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:28:55.309 --> 04:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
vote against the amendment in in park
 
04:28:56.809 --> 04:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
Prince will be because I I think that
 
04:28:56.819 --> 04:28:57.950 align:start position:0%
Prince will be because I I think that
legislating

04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
legislating
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
um uh Health Care in the practice of
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
Health Care is probably not our purview
 
04:29:05.809 --> 04:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
um there are many people on Medicaid
 
04:29:07.969 --> 04:29:07.979 align:start position:0%
that are in their 20s and 30s they're in
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
excellent health and you know they've
 
04:29:11.689 --> 04:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
got jobs to keep and you know they may
 
04:29:13.250 --> 04:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
not be able to go they don't feel bad
 
04:29:14.689 --> 04:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
if you were to query everybody around
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
the table I'd ask how many times did you
 
04:29:19.610 --> 04:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
see your primary care when you were in
 
04:29:21.649 --> 04:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
your 20s and 30s I would say that was
 
04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
not very often but you want to have the
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
health care available for them if they
 
04:29:28.849 --> 04:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
do need it I'm also concerned with that
 
04:29:31.490 --> 04:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
provision would overburden the primary
 
04:29:33.349 --> 04:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
care provider that they would be seeing
 
04:29:35.689 --> 04:29:35.699 align:start position:0%
a patient for an unnecessary unneeded
 
04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
visit and when other people need to come
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
in and be seen lastly I would say that
 
04:29:42.349 --> 04:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
primary care has a very broad definition
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
and it's not just your general
 
04:29:46.550 --> 04:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
practitioner it also could be included
 
04:29:48.649 --> 04:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
you're a pediatrician it includes your
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
OB GYN so I think that definition is
 
04:29:53.149 --> 04:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
just a bit too lacks without any
 
04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
specific definition so I would oppose
 
04:29:57.590 --> 04:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment representative okay thank
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just want to thank
 
04:30:01.309 --> 04:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman for the intent
 
04:30:03.649 --> 04:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
but I would like to pair it with my
 
04:30:04.790 --> 04:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
previous three Representatives
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues have said I agree with them
 
04:30:08.929 --> 04:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:10.849 --> 04:30:10.859 align:start position:0%
other discussion representative Cushman
 
04:30:12.170 --> 04:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
did you sure
 
04:30:15.290 --> 04:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
um well I just want to say that that
 
04:30:18.170 --> 04:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
point that's being made is contrary to
 
04:30:19.969 --> 04:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
the spirit of this entire program
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
especially since we that part of the
 
04:30:22.920 --> 04:30:24.530 align:start position:0%
especially since we that part of the
mcos

04:30:24.530 --> 04:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
mcos
 
04:30:24.540 --> 04:30:25.189 align:start position:0%
mcos
um

04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:27.469 --> 04:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
their goals is so that everyone gets
 
04:30:30.110 --> 04:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
primary care and it's been stated
 
04:30:33.370 --> 04:30:33.380 align:start position:0%
numerous times by our lobbyists and
 
04:30:35.450 --> 04:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
members of the public who came to
 
04:30:37.969 --> 04:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
testify that you know Primary Care is an
 
04:30:39.530 --> 04:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
essential essential piece of this
 
04:30:41.530 --> 04:30:41.540 align:start position:0%
because it's going to reduce
 
04:30:43.729 --> 04:30:43.739 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care in hospitals later
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
which was another goal of the program
 
04:30:50.030 --> 04:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:30:51.950 --> 04:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
um it's just it's starkly in contrast to
 
04:30:53.149 --> 04:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
that if that's the goal then we should
 
04:30:55.250 --> 04:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
be making sure that people are actually
 
04:30:57.590 --> 04:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
attaining that and actually the mco's
 
04:30:57.600 --> 04:30:59.170 align:start position:0%
attaining that and actually the mco's
incentivize

04:30:59.170 --> 04:30:59.180 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
patients to go and have their visits
 
04:31:04.969 --> 04:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
with their PCP they actually give them a
 
04:31:06.889 --> 04:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
little benefit card that they can get
 
04:31:09.710 --> 04:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
money on and they get money for going to
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
their primary care doctor
 
04:31:13.729 --> 04:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
I think that's a stark contrast with the
 
04:31:19.010 --> 04:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
spirit of the program but I'll leave
 
04:31:22.429 --> 04:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
that there representative Leon
 
04:31:24.769 --> 04:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I I too am a little bit confused it
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
seems that they're sort of two thrusts
 
04:31:31.309 --> 04:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
to this program there's the primary care
 
04:31:33.349 --> 04:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
provision making sure that people get
 
04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate Primary Care to prevent
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
um significant negative outcomes later
 
04:31:39.530 --> 04:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
and then there's this idea of
 
04:31:41.330 --> 04:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
catastrophic care you're talking about
 
04:31:43.250 --> 04:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
the uncompensated care you're talking
 
04:31:43.260 --> 04:31:44.809 align:start position:0%
the uncompensated care you're talking
about

04:31:44.809 --> 04:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:31:46.729 --> 04:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
um somebody who pressures their
 
04:31:48.170 --> 04:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
parachute into the ground and breaks a
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
femur that sort of thing that they that
 
04:31:52.729 --> 04:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
they otherwise may not have had care but
 
04:31:55.070 --> 04:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
they're having this so Primary Care
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
avoids all but those accidents that it
 
04:32:00.710 --> 04:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
helps to intervene earlier for all
 
04:32:02.750 --> 04:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
except those actual physical accidents
 
04:32:04.729 --> 04:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
so that we can reduce the overall cost
 
04:32:07.130 --> 04:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
of care and it was my understanding that
 
04:32:09.550 --> 04:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
that is the main part of this because
 
04:32:12.290 --> 04:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
looking to the whole system if we're
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
looking at the uncompensated care for
 
04:32:14.399 --> 04:32:16.309 align:start position:0%
looking at the uncompensated care for
accidents

04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
accidents
 
04:32:16.319 --> 04:32:17.090 align:start position:0%
accidents
um

04:32:17.090 --> 04:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:20.750 --> 04:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
other expensive end-stage healthcare
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
costs I'm almost wondering if then it
 
04:32:25.010 --> 04:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
becomes less expensive for us as a state
 
04:32:27.290 --> 04:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
to have a fund to pay for this
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care especially because
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
right now we're paying 50 million
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
dollars in state money with 450 million
 
04:32:36.410 --> 04:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
in in federal match in order to cover
 
04:32:38.510 --> 04:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
about 100 million in uncompensated care
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
so if our thrust isn't actually primary
 
04:32:43.969 --> 04:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
care and getting that early care then
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
then I'm starting to wonder especially
 
04:32:48.769 --> 04:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
if we don't have um a guarantee that the
 
04:32:50.570 --> 04:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
program would end if the the federal
 
04:32:52.610 --> 04:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
government backs off on their
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
contribution rate you know are we going
 
04:32:56.269 --> 04:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
to end up being in a better position
 
04:32:59.030 --> 04:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
financially being tied to this program
 
04:33:02.689 --> 04:33:02.699 align:start position:0%
versus just being ready as as a body to
 
04:33:04.609 --> 04:33:04.619 align:start position:0%
say here's our uncompensated care fund
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
here are the people that have have
 
04:33:08.209 --> 04:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
reached that catastrophic issue and
 
04:33:10.730 --> 04:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
we'll cover that if we're not willing to
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
incentivize Primary Care in order to
 
04:33:14.750 --> 04:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
intervene earlier so I I'm just having a
 
04:33:16.131 --> 04:33:16.141 align:start position:0%
hard time wrapping my head around these
 
04:33:18.170 --> 04:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
two competing interests and why there
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
would be conflict with this amendment
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.709 --> 04:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
oh okay start new can finish thank you
 
04:33:34.131 --> 04:33:34.141 align:start position:0%
so one issue I have with this is
 
04:33:34.141 --> 04:33:35.750 align:start position:0%
so one issue I have with this is
um that

04:33:35.750 --> 04:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
um that
 
04:33:37.609 --> 04:33:37.619 align:start position:0%
um where in the previous thing we were
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
talking about supporting uh Wellness
 
04:33:41.929 --> 04:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
visits and
 
04:33:44.330 --> 04:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
um you know it's great to start off that
 
04:33:46.189 --> 04:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
way but I don't think any other
 
04:33:49.490 --> 04:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
insurance company requires you to keep
 
04:33:52.609 --> 04:33:52.619 align:start position:0%
to go every year to maintain the
 
04:33:53.929 --> 04:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
insurance or certainly my employer
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
didn't require that of me the other
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
thing is that for most people under the
 
04:34:01.849 --> 04:34:01.859 align:start position:0%
age of 50 or so well even people over
 
04:34:04.429 --> 04:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
that an annual visit is no longer part
 
04:34:07.330 --> 04:34:07.340 align:start position:0%
of the recommended scheme for um anybody
 
04:34:10.010 --> 04:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the
 
04:34:12.590 --> 04:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
um you know American college Physicians
 
04:34:14.209 --> 04:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
recommendations American College of
 
04:34:16.730 --> 04:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
family physicians they have specific
 
04:34:18.830 --> 04:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations on screening over time
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't include an annual
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
physical and so to require that of of
 
04:34:26.209 --> 04:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
this particular group doesn't make sense
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
to me encouraging them to get that
 
04:34:30.529 --> 04:34:30.539 align:start position:0%
annual wellness check yes but but
 
04:34:32.929 --> 04:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
requiring it as a condition of remaining
 
04:34:34.250 --> 04:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
insured is a different thing
 
04:34:36.410 --> 04:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
particularly when it's not recommended
 
04:34:39.289 --> 04:34:39.299 align:start position:0%
medical care anymore
 
04:34:41.810 --> 04:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel did you you said
 
04:34:44.090 --> 04:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
all the smart stuff I was gonna say but
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
I'm I remember getting a beautiful chart
 
04:34:49.609 --> 04:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
of what the screening Wellness
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
recommendations were and as you said my
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
age group they don't recommend an annual
 
04:34:55.910 --> 04:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
physical at all the only reason I get
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
one is I'm not a med and he wants to see
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
me once a year to tell me I'm fine but
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
but the recommendations right now are
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
not annual
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
am I correct yeah
 
04:35:10.010 --> 04:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro you all set okay
 
04:35:12.650 --> 04:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
anyone else any other discussion
 
04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you I have
 
04:35:17.570 --> 04:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
a question then if um if these
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
screenings in these visits aren't
 
04:35:20.810 --> 04:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
covered are we paying for that in the
 
04:35:22.609 --> 04:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
MCO contracts to have these annual
 
04:35:27.410 --> 04:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:31.490 --> 04:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
so that's that covered or not I mean I
 
04:35:34.250 --> 04:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
as I said before encouraging people
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
particularly on enrolling in the in the
 
04:35:39.051 --> 04:35:39.061 align:start position:0%
program if especially if they haven't
 
04:35:40.369 --> 04:35:40.379 align:start position:0%
had health care
 
04:35:43.131 --> 04:35:43.141 align:start position:0%
encouraging them and paying for an
 
04:35:44.810 --> 04:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
initial visit to establish whether they
 
04:35:46.670 --> 04:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
have any problems makes a great deal of
 
04:35:48.289 --> 04:35:48.299 align:start position:0%
sense because that's where you can then
 
04:35:49.670 --> 04:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
prevent you know you find that this
 
04:35:51.769 --> 04:35:51.779 align:start position:0%
person is diabetic great now you've
 
04:35:55.789 --> 04:35:55.799 align:start position:0%
probably saved a ton of grief and money
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
um but just but but sort of arbitrarily
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
having every year just for the to say in
 
04:36:01.730 --> 04:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
the program doesn't isn't going to
 
04:36:04.490 --> 04:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
contribute to health it's just it's just
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
sort of a it becomes just a hoop to jump
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
through which
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
um would end up
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
with its own set of issues
 
04:36:16.849 --> 04:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman I just have a
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
question for representative Palmer
 
04:36:19.080 --> 04:36:19.849 align:start position:0%
question for representative Palmer
um

04:36:19.849 --> 04:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:22.131 --> 04:36:22.141 align:start position:0%
I I know you're
 
04:36:23.869 --> 04:36:23.879 align:start position:0%
um you're calling it a hoop to jump
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
through but this is taxpayer funded this
 
04:36:30.410 --> 04:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
is a entitlement program that's funded
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
by tax dollars I think that there should
 
04:36:36.529 --> 04:36:36.539 align:start position:0%
be some baseline accountability
 
04:36:39.289 --> 04:36:39.299 align:start position:0%
um and you know would you agree that we
 
04:36:46.131 --> 04:36:46.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:46.141 --> 04:36:47.631 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:36:47.631 --> 04:36:47.641 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:36:49.920 --> 04:36:50.570 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

04:36:50.570 --> 04:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:52.369 --> 04:36:52.379 align:start position:0%
the simple answer is I guess I haven't
 
04:36:54.170 --> 04:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
thought about this enough to really give
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
a thorough answer probably if you'd said
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
um if if this were you know people will
 
04:37:02.090 --> 04:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
be required to have an initial visit
 
04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
within a period of time for wellness
 
04:37:08.029 --> 04:37:08.039 align:start position:0%
then you've sort of accomplished what I
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
said which is you see whether this
 
04:37:11.869 --> 04:37:11.879 align:start position:0%
person has sort of hidden high blood
 
04:37:13.250 --> 04:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
pressure diabetes all of those things
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
that we should screen for but you're not
 
04:37:17.090 --> 04:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
then requiring them to come back every
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
year if they were completely healthy and
 
04:37:20.869 --> 04:37:20.879 align:start position:0%
are 32 years old
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
and you're also not going to take away
 
04:37:24.650 --> 04:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
the insurance that they may need if they
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
have an injury
 
04:37:27.119 --> 04:37:28.609 align:start position:0%
have an injury
um

04:37:28.609 --> 04:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:30.769 --> 04:37:30.779 align:start position:0%
just because
 
04:37:34.369 --> 04:37:34.379 align:start position:0%
okay so a diff sorry so like a different
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
iteration of this idea though you might
 
04:37:39.410 --> 04:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
support like if it if it was within the
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
first year they they need at least one
 
04:37:44.929 --> 04:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
visit with a primary care physician in
 
04:37:46.609 --> 04:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
the in the only other caveat getting
 
04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:48.061 align:start position:0%
back to what representative Murphy said
 
04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
is these people may have a hard time
 
04:37:52.189 --> 04:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
getting that visit and so you'd have to
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
allow some kind of leeway where you're
 
04:37:56.449 --> 04:37:56.459 align:start position:0%
you know like
 
04:37:58.910 --> 04:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
they've tried nine times and they
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
finally have an appointment for
 
04:38:02.029 --> 04:38:02.039 align:start position:0%
September of next year but at least
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
they're they're making the effort okay
 
04:38:07.310 --> 04:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant
 
04:38:09.890 --> 04:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Palmer's
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
I do agree that probably when they first
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
come into the program sometimes when
 
04:38:15.650 --> 04:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
they first come in the program they may
 
04:38:17.689 --> 04:38:17.699 align:start position:0%
not have had health care for a period of
 
04:38:17.699 --> 04:38:18.590 align:start position:0%
not have had health care for a period of
time

04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:38:20.990 --> 04:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
I checked in at that point to sort of
 
04:38:24.410 --> 04:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
help guide the primary care person to
 
04:38:26.929 --> 04:38:26.939 align:start position:0%
look at a screening if there's nothing
 
04:38:28.910 --> 04:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
found then I would say at that point
 
04:38:30.890 --> 04:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's probably up to the patient to
 
04:38:32.631 --> 04:38:32.641 align:start position:0%
develop symptoms of something to go back
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
to the primary care doctor however on
 
04:38:36.650 --> 04:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
the other hand if they do find diabetes
 
04:38:37.789 --> 04:38:37.799 align:start position:0%
or something of that nature they
 
04:38:39.051 --> 04:38:39.061 align:start position:0%
probably should be going to the primary
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
care doc at least once a year so it's
 
04:38:43.970 --> 04:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
more of a step process where the first
 
04:38:46.010 --> 04:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
time if you haven't been to a primary
 
04:38:47.449 --> 04:38:47.459 align:start position:0%
care doc because you didn't have any
 
04:38:49.369 --> 04:38:49.379 align:start position:0%
insurance you got a Medicare expansion
 
04:38:51.650 --> 04:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
you know have the coverage
 
04:38:53.330 --> 04:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
therefore you go see the primary care
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
doc I think at that initial visit is for
 
04:38:56.510 --> 04:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
them to take the time to screen the
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
patient to find out there's something
 
04:38:59.631 --> 04:38:59.641 align:start position:0%
that needs to be followed on a routine
 
04:38:59.641 --> 04:39:00.529 align:start position:0%
that needs to be followed on a routine
basis

04:39:00.529 --> 04:39:00.539 align:start position:0%
basis
 
04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
04:39:04.849 --> 04:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
um this is going to be an incredibly
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
cynical statement but I mean going back
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
I missed the whole basis of
 
04:39:12.529 --> 04:39:12.539 align:start position:0%
patient-centered care every patient's
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
unique every patient's different we do
 
04:39:17.090 --> 04:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
have routine protocols for everybody but
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
they're not annual um you have that
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
initial visit you make your decisions
 
04:39:22.970 --> 04:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
for that individual patient and thank
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
you that's the way we did things 30
 
04:39:25.730 --> 04:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
before everybody started telling us what
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
to do when it worked just fine and I
 
04:39:31.369 --> 04:39:31.379 align:start position:0%
mean that's the way the system should
 
04:39:31.379 --> 04:39:33.051 align:start position:0%
mean that's the way the system should
work

04:39:33.051 --> 04:39:33.061 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:39:35.869 --> 04:39:35.879 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you yeah and
 
04:39:37.970 --> 04:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
I would just reiterate that I would not
 
04:39:39.890 --> 04:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
be opposed I don't like the idea of
 
04:39:42.170 --> 04:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
legislating medical care but on the
 
04:39:44.288 --> 04:39:44.298 align:start position:0%
other hand to enter into this program
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
with the recommendation or requirement
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
of having a visit within the first uh 12
 
04:39:53.810 --> 04:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
to 16 months so that they get in there
 
04:39:55.070 --> 04:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's not just checking their blood
 
04:39:56.208 --> 04:39:56.218 align:start position:0%
pressure and seeing if they have high
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
blood sugar they would also do an exam
 
04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know a family history exam so if you
 
04:40:03.410 --> 04:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
have a history of colon cancer you may
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
recommend that they get their
 
04:40:06.650 --> 04:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy sooner or you have a history
 
04:40:08.030 --> 04:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
of prostate cancer you get it done
 
04:40:10.250 --> 04:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
Syrian piece whatever it is breast
 
04:40:11.690 --> 04:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
cancer whatever it is so you take it's
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
not just the blood work it's not the
 
04:40:14.090 --> 04:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
blood pressure it's also the family
 
04:40:16.970 --> 04:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
history but I I fully support Wellness
 
04:40:19.010 --> 04:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
exams and I think that
 
04:40:22.130 --> 04:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
um though I'm hesitant in a time to
 
04:40:24.410 --> 04:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
require a visit because I don't want to
 
04:40:26.208 --> 04:40:26.218 align:start position:0%
clutter up offices I don't think it
 
04:40:27.890 --> 04:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
would be inappropriate to strongly
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
recommend in some language that they see
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
somebody initially for their care in
 
04:40:31.920 --> 04:40:34.190 align:start position:0%
somebody initially for their care in
evaluation

04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
04:40:37.130 --> 04:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
04:40:40.570 --> 04:40:40.580 align:start position:0%
I think I I think I understand the
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
philosophically what this amendment is
 
04:40:47.810 --> 04:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.970 --> 04:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
is that patients should have some skin
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
in the game and there should be
 
04:40:53.330 --> 04:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
accountability it's a public program
 
04:40:55.970 --> 04:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
that uses taxpayer dollars and therefore
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
there should be some accountability on
 
04:41:03.170 --> 04:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
the part of patience or recipients
 
04:41:06.650 --> 04:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
um so I understand philosophically I I
 
04:41:09.970 --> 04:41:09.980 align:start position:0%
think where this comes from
 
04:41:13.250 --> 04:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
but I don't understand what I don't get
 
04:41:16.910 --> 04:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
is is there a specific problem that's
 
04:41:19.730 --> 04:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
borne out by data that says this is
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
something we have to fix I mean do we
 
04:41:24.110 --> 04:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
know that people are not are under
 
04:41:28.010 --> 04:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
utilizing care or not signing up with a
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
so is there is there data that points to
 
04:41:37.070 --> 04:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
a specific problem that we're trying to
 
04:41:38.810 --> 04:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
fix with this amendment
 
04:41:41.570 --> 04:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
because other otherwise it feels to me
 
04:41:44.690 --> 04:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
like it's just punitive that it's just
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and really
 
04:41:46.320 --> 04:41:47.868 align:start position:0%
um and really
um

04:41:47.868 --> 04:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:50.090 --> 04:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about the Dignity of the
 
04:41:52.690 --> 04:41:52.700 align:start position:0%
patients also that we not be
 
04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
micromanaging what they do and what they
 
04:41:57.350 --> 04:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
don't do unless there's a specific
 
04:42:00.410 --> 04:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
problem that we're trying to remedy
 
04:42:02.090 --> 04:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question respectfully
 
04:42:04.730 --> 04:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
the specific problem is wasteful
 
04:42:07.368 --> 04:42:07.378 align:start position:0%
spending I mean that affects the entire
 
04:42:10.368 --> 04:42:10.378 align:start position:0%
state if we have people on the rolls for
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
this program that never utilize it and
 
04:42:15.288 --> 04:42:15.298 align:start position:0%
really don't care to utilize it why do
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
we pay the mcos you know per person
 
04:42:21.650 --> 04:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
who's on the rolls it just it's not a
 
04:42:24.050 --> 04:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
responsible way to do business and in
 
04:42:25.490 --> 04:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we tend to be responsible
 
04:42:27.410 --> 04:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
with taxpayer money and entitlement
 
04:42:29.690 --> 04:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
programs so I think putting a little
 
04:42:31.970 --> 04:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
your your you hit the nail on the head
 
04:42:35.628 --> 04:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
that this is a from a matter of it's a
 
04:42:38.448 --> 04:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
matter of principle in governing if we
 
04:42:40.430 --> 04:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
are to offer programs there needs to be
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit of accountability and I
 
04:42:44.330 --> 04:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
think that this entire program because
 
04:42:48.170 --> 04:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
it's mostly the the way that the federal
 
04:42:50.930 --> 04:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
government has designed it
 
04:42:54.050 --> 04:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and our community engagement aspect
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
of it is not enforceable there is there
 
04:42:59.570 --> 04:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
is little accountability in it so I
 
04:43:01.368 --> 04:43:01.378 align:start position:0%
would just like to see that we're making
 
04:43:03.410 --> 04:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
sure that it's being utilized and if
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's not being utilized by by some mem
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
some members who are on the rolls that
 
04:43:10.730 --> 04:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
they they should be removed and they
 
04:43:12.170 --> 04:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
should just agree to that when they
 
04:43:14.030 --> 04:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
apply for it
 
04:43:17.050 --> 04:43:17.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up representative
 
04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
I I'll address this to you but
 
04:43:22.070 --> 04:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman but if anybody
 
04:43:25.550 --> 04:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
might um know do we have any data on how
 
04:43:28.730 --> 04:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
many people do not go to their Primary
 
04:43:28.740 --> 04:43:29.990 align:start position:0%
many people do not go to their Primary
Care

04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
Care
 
04:43:32.050 --> 04:43:32.060 align:start position:0%
um provider or
 
04:43:35.330 --> 04:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
what percentage of people do not utilize
 
04:43:37.610 --> 04:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
the program in a way that
 
04:43:39.890 --> 04:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
we may think is the right way to utilize
 
04:43:39.900 --> 04:43:41.868 align:start position:0%
we may think is the right way to utilize
it

04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:43:43.850 --> 04:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
it's a good question I don't think I
 
04:43:46.070 --> 04:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that we do but we probably
 
04:43:46.080 --> 04:43:47.930 align:start position:0%
don't know that we do but we probably
should

04:43:47.930 --> 04:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:43:50.570 --> 04:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
so I I mean this is getting into the
 
04:43:55.490 --> 04:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
weeds and maybe somebody from HHS can
 
04:43:58.910 --> 04:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
answer this but I mean we have a Managed
 
04:44:01.610 --> 04:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
Care Organization running these programs
 
04:44:03.770 --> 04:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
and I think that the rationale is
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
probably that the the numbers in New
 
04:44:08.930 --> 04:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are too small to make it
 
04:44:10.970 --> 04:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
um what's the word that insurance
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
companies use
 
04:44:15.770 --> 04:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
um the the bottom line is that if we do
 
04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
if we have an MCO that it's going to
 
04:44:20.810 --> 04:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
cost the state a fixed amount per number
 
04:44:22.490 --> 04:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
of patients and we don't have to worry
 
04:44:24.350 --> 04:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
that seven of them end up needing bone
 
04:44:26.270 --> 04:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
marrow transplants and that the program
 
04:44:29.208 --> 04:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
gets blown out of the water
 
04:44:32.030 --> 04:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
um and so on the one hand you know
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about having people who
 
04:44:36.050 --> 04:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
were paying so much per month to be in
 
04:44:39.170 --> 04:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
the program is a problem but we're doing
 
04:44:41.330 --> 04:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
it that way because overall we we think
 
04:44:43.490 --> 04:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
or whoever set this program up thinks
 
04:44:46.490 --> 04:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
that that's going to a save money in the
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
long term and but B prevent you know big
 
04:44:52.610 --> 04:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
Financial spikes that would be a real
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
problem and I don't know if there was a
 
04:44:57.410 --> 04:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
choice whether New Hampshire chose to go
 
04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
the MCO route in you know California
 
04:45:01.970 --> 04:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
they're they're big enough to
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
self-insure so they're doing it on a
 
04:45:10.368 --> 04:45:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:12.770 --> 04:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative Nagel thank you
 
04:45:14.868 --> 04:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
that this has been a very interesting
 
04:45:18.170 --> 04:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
discussion thanks for bringing it up um
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
I would probably be willing to answer
 
04:45:22.910 --> 04:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
your question earlier representative
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
Cushman I think I would be
 
04:45:27.650 --> 04:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
willing to support a statement that say
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
within a certain time frame of either
 
04:45:32.570 --> 04:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
before or after becoming enrolled that
 
04:45:34.368 --> 04:45:34.378 align:start position:0%
you were expected to see your doctor and
 
04:45:36.410 --> 04:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
then the doctor and you create a
 
04:45:39.288 --> 04:45:39.298 align:start position:0%
strategy for long-term management of
 
04:45:40.910 --> 04:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
problems you do where you don't have a
 
04:45:42.530 --> 04:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
lot of these patients already have a
 
04:45:44.570 --> 04:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
relationship with the primary so I would
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
include you know prior experience in
 
04:45:49.128 --> 04:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
that whatever definition you chose to
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
make but I think given the circumstances
 
04:45:53.390 --> 04:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
as you've raised them I think that makes
 
04:45:53.400 --> 04:45:55.490 align:start position:0%
as you've raised them I think that makes
sense

04:45:55.490 --> 04:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:45:57.890 --> 04:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
04:45:59.990 --> 04:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you colleagues for
 
04:46:01.730 --> 04:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
this great discussion
 
04:46:04.250 --> 04:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
um it seems it seems like this whole
 
04:46:06.170 --> 04:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
idea of an annual visit may not be
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I'm curious about
 
04:46:07.798 --> 04:46:09.288 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I'm curious about
whether

04:46:09.288 --> 04:46:09.298 align:start position:0%
whether
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
um having a care plan that's agreed upon
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
by that primary care provider and the
 
04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
patient would make sense that way if you
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
had a condition that required more
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
frequent monitoring there would be that
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
incentive to actually come and show up
 
04:46:22.850 --> 04:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
for your appointments but if you were
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
healthy as a horse and they said we'll
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
see you in another five years if you're
 
04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
still on this program or even if not
 
04:46:30.830 --> 04:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'll see you in five years unless you
 
04:46:32.510 --> 04:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
have a problem that if there was an
 
04:46:34.250 --> 04:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
agreed upon care plan that may be
 
04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
something that we could help
 
04:46:38.690 --> 04:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
um keep people too because
 
04:46:40.250 --> 04:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
I know there's a lot of people that
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily like going to the
 
04:46:43.368 --> 04:46:43.378 align:start position:0%
doctor and I know there's a lot of
 
04:46:45.110 --> 04:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
people whose schedules fill up with
 
04:46:47.090 --> 04:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
everything that is not the necessary and
 
04:46:47.100 --> 04:46:48.530 align:start position:0%
everything that is not the necessary and
required

04:46:48.530 --> 04:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
um it's really easy to put your health
 
04:46:51.890 --> 04:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
on the back burner especially if you're
 
04:46:54.350 --> 04:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
a parent with small kids but if you do
 
04:46:55.850 --> 04:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
that for too long there might be a fire
 
04:46:59.150 --> 04:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
on that stove and if if we can figure
 
04:47:01.070 --> 04:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
out if we can have a care plan that's
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
agreed upon by the primary care and the
 
04:47:04.430 --> 04:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
patient about how frequently they would
 
04:47:07.070 --> 04:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
come in that could be negotiated and be
 
04:47:08.690 --> 04:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
considered something that would be
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable obviously it could be fleshed
 
04:47:13.368 --> 04:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
out in rules but that might be some way
 
04:47:13.378 --> 04:47:14.570 align:start position:0%
out in rules but that might be some way
to

04:47:14.570 --> 04:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:47:16.550 --> 04:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
sort of get some better buy-in between
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
both the patient and the physician about
 
04:47:20.448 --> 04:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
how frequently they should come in and
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
if we're paying a capitated rate for
 
04:47:24.410 --> 04:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
people to come in and get care I think
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
that that would show a longer term
 
04:47:29.628 --> 04:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
reduction in the cost of care when you
 
04:47:30.650 --> 04:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
know that you have people who are
 
04:47:31.970 --> 04:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
actually showing up to their
 
04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
appointments because I do know from the
 
04:47:35.448 --> 04:47:35.458 align:start position:0%
device World
 
04:47:37.610 --> 04:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
um and looking with the hospitals at
 
04:47:40.368 --> 04:47:40.378 align:start position:0%
that time people who don't follow up on
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
their treatments can often end up with
 
04:47:45.410 --> 04:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
um unexpected well
 
04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
often end up I would call it unexpected
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately when you look at the
 
04:47:51.170 --> 04:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
Actuarial tables it's actually it's an
 
04:47:53.590 --> 04:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
expected outcome just not for everybody
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious what people would think
 
04:47:58.850 --> 04:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
about a care plan for visits as opposed
 
04:48:01.010 --> 04:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
to an annual recommendation because that
 
04:48:03.288 --> 04:48:03.298 align:start position:0%
could allow those who are both more
 
04:48:03.298 --> 04:48:04.430 align:start position:0%
could allow those who are both more
um

04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
more medically complex and those who are
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
a lot less medically complex both to get
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
a better idea of the playing field and
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
figure out how to collaborate going
 
04:48:12.360 --> 04:48:13.430 align:start position:0%
figure out how to collaborate going
forward

04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:48:18.050 --> 04:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
I want to say thank you groups of Leon
 
04:48:22.610 --> 04:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
for what you're bringing forth and also
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:29.050 --> 04:48:29.060 align:start position:0%
place any of these requirements on the
 
04:48:31.550 --> 04:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
employer-sponsored healthcare
 
04:48:33.948 --> 04:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
is a free market they basically at that
 
04:48:35.810 --> 04:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
point in time negotiate
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
plan with the insurance companies based
 
04:48:40.490 --> 04:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
upon what they decide that they want to
 
04:48:42.530 --> 04:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
cover and what they do so I don't know
 
04:48:44.330 --> 04:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
why we're getting into the micromanaging
 
04:48:46.128 --> 04:48:46.138 align:start position:0%
of trying to figure out what to do with
 
04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
Granite State Advantage with the MCO
 
04:48:50.448 --> 04:48:50.458 align:start position:0%
contract I think I'll go back to I said
 
04:48:52.550 --> 04:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
before a lot of this belongs in the
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
commission not here in this legislative
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
body and let them bring the
 
04:48:57.890 --> 04:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
recommendations back to us as policy
 
04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
makers to make a change in the policy if
 
04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
we need to but again I go back
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
when we have commercial insurance
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
companies out there we don't try to
 
04:49:08.030 --> 04:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
micromanage them either so why are we
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
trying to do it here today
 
04:49:12.590 --> 04:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
04:49:12.600 --> 04:49:13.730 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
chairman

04:49:13.730 --> 04:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:49:17.390 --> 04:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I I reject the um the comparison
 
04:49:21.070 --> 04:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
between a employer who's paying for
 
04:49:25.128 --> 04:49:25.138 align:start position:0%
health care for his employees and that's
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
their choice
 
04:49:27.240 --> 04:49:28.070 align:start position:0%
their choice
um

04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:31.610 --> 04:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers a taxpayer-funded health
 
04:49:33.230 --> 04:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
care plan
 
04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers don't have a choice they pay
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
their taxes it comes out of of you know
 
04:49:40.490 --> 04:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
their paycheck from the federal
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
government and
 
04:49:45.288 --> 04:49:45.298 align:start position:0%
you know from their business Enterprise
 
04:49:48.770 --> 04:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
tax or or what have you in the state but
 
04:49:51.190 --> 04:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's completely different
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
we we have a vested interest in ensuring
 
04:49:59.050 --> 04:49:59.060 align:start position:0%
that this program is responsibly run
 
04:50:02.090 --> 04:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
that there are checks and balances for
 
04:50:02.100 --> 04:50:03.310 align:start position:0%
that there are checks and balances for
financial

04:50:03.310 --> 04:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
financial
 
04:50:06.050 --> 04:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
responsibility and enrollee
 
04:50:06.060 --> 04:50:07.430 align:start position:0%
responsibility and enrollee
accountability

04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:50:09.170 --> 04:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
that's completely different from an
 
04:50:12.410 --> 04:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
employer sponsored private insurance
 
04:50:12.420 --> 04:50:15.970 align:start position:0%
employer sponsored private insurance
foreign

04:50:15.970 --> 04:50:15.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:18.530 --> 04:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and respectfully
 
04:50:21.470 --> 04:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to weigh in on that as well as
 
04:50:23.510 --> 04:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
the legislators we are the ones
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
entrusted with figuring out where to put
 
04:50:28.128 --> 04:50:28.138 align:start position:0%
the state's dollars employers who are
 
04:50:30.530 --> 04:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
buying employers sponsored um health
 
04:50:33.650 --> 04:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
insurance have the opportunity to make
 
04:50:35.810 --> 04:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
make changes and make choices within
 
04:50:37.490 --> 04:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
their insurance as the market
 
04:50:39.530 --> 04:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
standardizes with more and more people
 
04:50:42.288 --> 04:50:42.298 align:start position:0%
on standardized care like Medicaid
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion and um and some of
 
04:50:47.030 --> 04:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
the other programs that simply follow
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
along there's less and less choice for
 
04:50:50.750 --> 04:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
those employer-sponsored plans as well
 
04:50:54.850 --> 04:50:54.860 align:start position:0%
but as as the stewards of taxpayer money
 
04:50:57.770 --> 04:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
it is our job respectfully to put out
 
04:50:59.570 --> 04:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
some of those requirements for those MCO
 
04:51:02.030 --> 04:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
contracts and that's specifically why
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
this program needs to be reauthorized
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
from time to time as opposed to approved
 
04:51:10.490 --> 04:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:13.610 --> 04:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
all right there's no other discussion
 
04:51:16.970 --> 04:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
I'll ask at the Clark call the wall
 
04:51:20.350 --> 04:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass on Amendment
 
04:51:27.050 --> 04:51:27.060 align:start position:0%

okay

04:52:44.030 --> 04:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:52:45.170 --> 04:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how long the next
 
04:52:46.490 --> 04:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
discussion is going to take one of you
 
04:52:47.930 --> 04:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
has indicated at least one of you has
 
04:52:50.330 --> 04:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
indicated they need to leave it three
 
04:52:53.570 --> 04:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
so um I'm I'm here for however long but
 
04:52:56.570 --> 04:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
obviously it's an executive session so
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
um representative land
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that this one will be
 
04:53:01.550 --> 04:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
a little shorter so I don't know if I
 
04:53:03.410 --> 04:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
could introduce this amendment true well
 
04:53:06.490 --> 04:53:06.500 align:start position:0%
give it a whirl I move that we adopted
 
04:53:09.708 --> 04:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
1629 each I will pass that around and
 
04:53:13.970 --> 04:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
this one is about the acceptability of
 
04:53:13.980 --> 04:53:15.170 align:start position:0%
this one is about the acceptability of
waivers

04:53:15.170 --> 04:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
04:53:22.310 --> 04:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:24.170 --> 04:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
I know there's some in this stuff
 
04:53:26.090 --> 04:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
somewhere else let's send these along
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:33.470 --> 04:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I should have put the box on the
 
04:53:35.150 --> 04:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
table I was trying not to scare anybody
 
04:53:36.890 --> 04:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
with my file folders but it would have
 
04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:46.680 --> 04:53:48.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:53:48.170 --> 04:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:50.208 --> 04:53:50.218 align:start position:0%
I may have sent too many Along on that
 
04:53:50.218 --> 04:53:58.010 align:start position:0%
I may have sent too many Along on that
side

04:53:58.010 --> 04:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:04.030 --> 04:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:07.490 --> 04:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
any chance thank you
 
04:54:09.470 --> 04:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay I could pass these along that way I
 
04:54:27.170 --> 04:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:29.628 --> 04:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
okay that's a single-sided so there's
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
two pages
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
to 1629 H leading amended analysis and
 
04:54:39.410 --> 04:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:39.420 --> 04:54:40.970 align:start position:0%
 
yourself

04:54:40.970 --> 04:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
there was one that came out not
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
double-sided because the page is stuck
 
04:54:44.400 --> 04:54:45.350 align:start position:0%
double-sided because the page is stuck
together

04:54:45.350 --> 04:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:54:46.610 --> 04:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think I successfully
 
04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
removed that from the stack so I
 
04:54:48.240 --> 04:54:49.610 align:start position:0%
removed that from the stack so I
apologize

04:54:49.610 --> 04:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
um if you got just the amended analysis
 
04:54:53.628 --> 04:54:53.638 align:start position:0%
you can probably trash that the the main
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
part of the bill is the section amending
 
04:55:00.410 --> 04:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
section inserting section eight
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:06.240 --> 04:55:07.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:55:07.490 --> 04:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:10.550 --> 04:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
sorry yes inserting this um so what it
 
04:55:12.770 --> 04:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
says doing is a bending part of the
 
04:55:15.170 --> 04:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
underlying bill that we are looking to
 
04:55:18.770 --> 04:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
potentially reaffirm in perpetuity uh in
 
04:55:20.570 --> 04:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
the statute right now it gives rule
 
04:55:24.830 --> 04:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
making authority to the commissioner
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to know who in this
 
04:55:28.670 --> 04:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
committee knows how to define the terms
 
04:55:32.948 --> 04:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:37.970 --> 04:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:40.490 --> 04:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative seconds got it sorry
 
04:55:42.350 --> 04:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I want to thank the
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
clerk for pointing that out to me thank
 
04:55:45.530 --> 04:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
you go ahead representative land sorry
 
04:55:46.850 --> 04:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
to interrupt uh definitely I think we
 
04:55:48.850 --> 04:55:48.860 align:start position:0%
all need some more coffee soon
 
04:55:52.250 --> 04:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh so I was also digging through all the
 
04:55:54.470 --> 04:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
roles associated with this program
 
04:55:54.480 --> 04:55:55.190 align:start position:0%
roles associated with this program
um

04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
there's more issues there within the
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
rules and them going outside of the the
 
04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislative prescription but right now
 
04:56:03.650 --> 04:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
it says that the rules should be
 
04:56:05.270 --> 04:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
consistent with the terms and conditions
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
of any waiver issued by the centers for
 
04:56:08.930 --> 04:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid services for the
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
program it's provided that any waiver
 
04:56:14.270 --> 04:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
issued is not unreasonably inconsistent
 
04:56:16.610 --> 04:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
with the provisions of this chapter and
 
04:56:18.368 --> 04:56:18.378 align:start position:0%
then it gives some conditions
 
04:56:22.368 --> 04:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
unreasonably inconsistent is
 
04:56:23.930 --> 04:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
it's something that I can't quite Define
 
04:56:26.810 --> 04:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if anybody else can but um
 
04:56:28.970 --> 04:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
I think that that just gives too much
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
Authority that any waiver that comes
 
04:56:32.868 --> 04:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
through amended would then go into our
 
04:56:35.448 --> 04:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
rules and then have the force of law so
 
04:56:37.368 --> 04:56:37.378 align:start position:0%
in order to address that and address the
 
04:56:40.610 --> 04:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
fact that if this is adopted permanently
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
we would be putting into our rules
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
whatever waivers come down from the
 
04:56:46.850 --> 04:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
federal government and giving the force
 
04:56:49.610 --> 04:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
of our law to those waivers it should
 
04:56:52.128 --> 04:56:52.138 align:start position:0%
not be in conflict with any of this
 
04:56:55.368 --> 04:56:55.378 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation so that's why I
 
04:56:57.050 --> 04:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
have this amendment here in order to
 
04:56:58.970 --> 04:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
make sure that any waivers that we
 
04:57:00.830 --> 04:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
accept by putting them into our rules
 
04:57:02.930 --> 04:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
are not in conflict with our enabling
 
04:57:02.940 --> 04:57:07.070 align:start position:0%
are not in conflict with our enabling
law

04:57:07.070 --> 04:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:07.080 --> 04:57:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

04:57:12.470 --> 04:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
wow yes it is going to be shorter
 
04:57:17.330 --> 04:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
okay if there's no discussion I'll ask
 
04:57:19.250 --> 04:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
the clerk to follow all
 
04:57:21.288 --> 04:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass on Amendment
 
04:57:25.730 --> 04:57:25.740 align:start position:0%

next week
um

04:58:34.250 --> 04:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:35.750 --> 04:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
looks like you have more amendments are
 
04:58:37.550 --> 04:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
they short as short as this sir it's
 
04:58:38.590 --> 04:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
hard to tell
 
04:58:41.050 --> 04:58:41.060 align:start position:0%
I mean honestly
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes there's another short one here I
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
guess I honestly thought there'd be some
 
04:58:47.090 --> 04:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
discussion if there was dissent to that
 
04:58:47.100 --> 04:58:48.110 align:start position:0%
discussion if there was dissent to that
Amendment

04:58:48.110 --> 04:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
um would you if you want to offer
 
04:58:51.770 --> 04:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
another one
 
04:58:51.780 --> 04:58:54.530 align:start position:0%
another one
wow

04:58:54.530 --> 04:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
wow
 
04:58:56.570 --> 04:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
04:58:59.090 --> 04:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
um I move that we
 
04:59:02.830 --> 04:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
I move ought to pass on Amendment 2023
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
1620h to Senate bill 263. is there a
 
04:59:07.200 --> 04:59:08.448 align:start position:0%
1620h to Senate bill 263. is there a
second

04:59:08.448 --> 04:59:08.458 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:59:11.930 --> 04:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:15.070 --> 04:59:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so this amendment
 
04:59:17.690 --> 04:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
passing around
 
04:59:17.700 --> 04:59:20.510 align:start position:0%
passing around
okay

04:59:20.510 --> 04:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.850 --> 04:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
um is very simple
 
04:59:25.010 --> 04:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
um so as we were talking about the
 
04:59:26.868 --> 04:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
community engagement requirement that's
 
04:59:29.330 --> 04:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
the the work requirement
 
04:59:34.010 --> 04:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
um currently it's not enforced and
 
04:59:34.020 --> 04:59:34.730 align:start position:0%
um currently it's not enforced and
um

04:59:34.730 --> 04:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:37.730 --> 04:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
I was told that there is a chance that
 
04:59:40.750 --> 04:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government may be changing
 
04:59:43.550 --> 04:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
their approval of these work
 
04:59:46.368 --> 04:59:46.378 align:start position:0%
requirements and Georgia now has one in
 
04:59:46.378 --> 04:59:47.208 align:start position:0%
requirements and Georgia now has one in
place

04:59:47.208 --> 04:59:47.218 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:59:48.770 --> 04:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
um so ours got kind of kicked around the
 
04:59:51.050 --> 04:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
courts and then
 
04:59:53.690 --> 04:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
um our request for approval was
 
04:59:58.430 --> 04:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
withdrawn so we could request approval
 
05:00:01.868 --> 05:00:01.878 align:start position:0%
of this again and I think that it is our
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
duty to do so to apply for the center
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
for Medicare and Medicaid services to
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
approve our community engagement
 
05:00:13.788 --> 05:00:13.798 align:start position:0%
requirements under this section
 
05:00:16.090 --> 05:00:16.100 align:start position:0%
so this just directs the commissioner
 
05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
within six months of the enactment of
 
05:00:22.368 --> 05:00:22.378 align:start position:0%
um SB 263
 
05:00:25.128 --> 05:00:25.138 align:start position:0%
to submit that request to the federal
 
05:00:25.138 --> 05:00:27.590 align:start position:0%
to submit that request to the federal
government

05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.610 --> 05:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:33.530 --> 05:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
05:00:36.050 --> 05:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think this is absolutely
 
05:00:39.170 --> 05:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
critical our current statute 126 double
 
05:00:42.288 --> 05:00:42.298 align:start position:0%
A has plenty of requests for waivers and
 
05:00:45.170 --> 05:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
it's important to put that request in so
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
that it is the will of the legislature
 
05:00:48.240 --> 05:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
that it is the will of the legislature
um

05:00:49.190 --> 05:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:52.250 --> 05:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
and so I support this amendment
 
05:00:55.610 --> 05:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:58.128 --> 05:00:58.138 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I'm going to vote
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
against this amendment
 
05:00:59.760 --> 05:01:00.830 align:start position:0%
against this amendment
um

05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:01:05.390 --> 05:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
it is true that this was
 
05:01:05.400 --> 05:01:06.410 align:start position:0%
it is true that this was
um

05:01:06.410 --> 05:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:09.288 --> 05:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
ruled invalid by a federal court and
 
05:01:11.090 --> 05:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
what the federal court said was that
 
05:01:13.010 --> 05:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
providing Medicare to the needy is
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
Medicaid's core objective and the waiver
 
05:01:17.628 --> 05:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
failed to adequately consider the work
 
05:01:19.850 --> 05:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
requirements effect on Medicaid coverage
 
05:01:22.128 --> 05:01:22.138 align:start position:0%
in other words that
 
05:01:22.138 --> 05:01:25.510 align:start position:0%
in other words that
um

05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
the core principle of Medicaid is to
 
05:01:32.930 --> 05:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
provide medical coverage not to provide
 
05:01:36.890 --> 05:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
work Readiness or character building so
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
that was the spirit of the Court
 
05:01:41.868 --> 05:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
decision which I agree with
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:01:46.550 --> 05:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
whether it whether
 
05:01:46.560 --> 05:01:47.868 align:start position:0%
whether it whether
things

05:01:47.868 --> 05:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:01:51.050 --> 05:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
have changed enough so that uh a waiver
 
05:01:53.448 --> 05:01:53.458 align:start position:0%
such as this would be reconsidered by
 
05:01:55.910 --> 05:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
the federal government I don't know but
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
in any case I'm against having this kind
 
05:01:59.868 --> 05:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
of work requirement so I'm going to vote
 
05:02:01.930 --> 05:02:01.940 align:start position:0%
no on this
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:08.090 --> 05:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
05:02:09.770 --> 05:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
chairman um so
 
05:02:13.550 --> 05:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
um I I got the history for of this from
 
05:02:16.730 --> 05:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
um Mr Robert Berry from the Department
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
um and he did mention to me that the U.S
 
05:02:21.050 --> 05:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives is considering
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that would Implement some
 
05:02:25.070 --> 05:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
form of community engagement
 
05:02:27.410 --> 05:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
um for CMS and that
 
05:02:33.230 --> 05:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
um that it very well may be possible
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
that ours would be approved so I think
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
now while we have this bill in front of
 
05:02:41.930 --> 05:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
us and while the federal government
 
05:02:44.390 --> 05:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
um you know is in their
 
05:02:44.400 --> 05:02:46.788 align:start position:0%
um you know is in their
negotiations

05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
um we there's nothing to lose by having
 
05:02:51.770 --> 05:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
this request submitted we you know we
 
05:02:53.448 --> 05:02:53.458 align:start position:0%
just need to seek this waiver if it's
 
05:02:56.030 --> 05:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
going to be available and you know it's
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
in our statute already
 
05:03:00.530 --> 05:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
05:03:03.050 --> 05:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
the the legislature has spoken that it
 
05:03:04.970 --> 05:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
does this work requirement should be in
 
05:03:06.170 --> 05:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
place we want there to be a work
 
05:03:08.690 --> 05:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
requirement if this program is to be
 
05:03:10.368 --> 05:03:10.378 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire this is what makes
 
05:03:10.378 --> 05:03:12.110 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire this is what makes
this

05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
part of what makes this
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
um a New Hampshire specific program
 
05:03:18.170 --> 05:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
otherwise you know
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
we're just doing whatever the federal
 
05:03:19.798 --> 05:03:21.610 align:start position:0%
we're just doing whatever the federal
government

05:03:21.610 --> 05:03:21.620 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:03:24.170 --> 05:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
prescribes so I think if there's an
 
05:03:26.990 --> 05:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to implement it that
 
05:03:30.170 --> 05:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
it's you know our responsibility to try
 
05:03:30.180 --> 05:03:32.750 align:start position:0%
it's you know our responsibility to try
to

05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.810 --> 05:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
05:03:40.490 --> 05:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
chairman I think this once again
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
illustrates how a large section of the
 
05:03:46.010 --> 05:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
statute in 126 double A is not in effect
 
05:03:47.990 --> 05:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
because it's about the work requirements
 
05:03:49.970 --> 05:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
and the community engagement that is not
 
05:03:52.610 --> 05:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
enforceable so once again this is why we
 
05:03:54.890 --> 05:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
need to have a sunset on this and why we
 
05:03:58.250 --> 05:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:03.530 --> 05:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
there's no other discussion I'll ask the
 
05:04:05.810 --> 05:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
clue I'm sorry representative Palmer did
 
05:04:09.350 --> 05:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
you just turned it off turned it off
 
05:04:14.650 --> 05:04:14.660 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you I I was just reading and
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
my concern would be this
 
05:04:19.490 --> 05:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
um so Georgia has just managed to get
 
05:04:19.500 --> 05:04:20.330 align:start position:0%
um so Georgia has just managed to get
this

05:04:20.330 --> 05:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:04:24.650 --> 05:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
past through their the court down there
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
um but the judge there ruled it was
 
05:04:29.330 --> 05:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
substantially different from the case in
 
05:04:31.550 --> 05:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Arkansas and New Hampshire so
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
since and and the reason I guess is
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
because Georgia had just enacted their
 
05:04:39.650 --> 05:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion expansion we already
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
have it so we we along with Kentucky and
 
05:04:46.010 --> 05:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
Arkansas are con it's considered a
 
05:04:48.830 --> 05:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
reduction in benefits by doing this and
 
05:04:50.750 --> 05:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
so the court said that's that's a
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
problem but what Georgia did was they
 
05:04:55.368 --> 05:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
did it initially so they were expanding
 
05:04:58.250 --> 05:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
their services so I'm not a lawyer but
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
my concern would be if we try to push
 
05:05:02.390 --> 05:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
this in New Hampshire has to go to court
 
05:05:04.070 --> 05:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
how much is that going to cost and are
 
05:05:06.350 --> 05:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
we going to just run up against a brick
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you
 
05:05:14.330 --> 05:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
um well it doesn't say that we have to
 
05:05:16.190 --> 05:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
carry it to you know push it through the
 
05:05:17.448 --> 05:05:17.458 align:start position:0%
courts it just says that they have to
 
05:05:19.970 --> 05:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
submit an or a request for approval of
 
05:05:22.850 --> 05:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
the of the waiver I mean of the
 
05:05:24.890 --> 05:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
community engagement
 
05:05:28.850 --> 05:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
so and as we're by that time within six
 
05:05:30.650 --> 05:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
months from now legislation may have
 
05:05:32.750 --> 05:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
gone through on the federal level that
 
05:05:35.090 --> 05:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
permits that to be
 
05:05:35.100 --> 05:05:37.910 align:start position:0%
permits that to be
operable

05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
other discussion representative Palazzo
 
05:05:45.490 --> 05:05:45.500 align:start position:0%
I will support this amendment I think it
 
05:05:48.310 --> 05:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
reinforces us the intent
 
05:05:51.890 --> 05:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
of the uh underlying
 
05:05:51.900 --> 05:05:52.570 align:start position:0%
of the uh underlying
um

05:05:52.570 --> 05:05:52.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
existing legislation and it's very
 
05:06:02.810 --> 05:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
important uh to stay in
 
05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh with that intent because even though
 
05:06:10.970 --> 05:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
we had we had many testimonies that many
 
05:06:10.980 --> 05:06:12.430 align:start position:0%
we had we had many testimonies that many
participants

05:06:12.430 --> 05:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
participants
 
05:06:17.810 --> 05:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
of this uh indicator expansion are
 
05:06:21.850 --> 05:06:21.860 align:start position:0%
uh working and being
 
05:06:25.970 --> 05:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
engaged we don't know what economic
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
situation would be in one year or in two
 
05:06:33.310 --> 05:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
years and what new participants of this
 
05:06:33.320 --> 05:06:35.050 align:start position:0%
years and what new participants of this
Medicaid

05:06:35.050 --> 05:06:35.060 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
05:06:39.410 --> 05:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
expansion will be and in what
 
05:06:43.090 --> 05:06:43.100 align:start position:0%
circumstances so I think it's important
 
05:06:45.250 --> 05:06:45.260 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
05:06:49.610 --> 05:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh ask for this approval so I will
 
05:06:52.310 --> 05:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
support this amendment
 
05:06:56.570 --> 05:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:59.930 --> 05:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna admit my total naivety but um
 
05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
two questions one is where do I find the
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
community engagement requirement
 
05:07:07.730 --> 05:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
and secondly we're just submitting a
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
request to CMS who could easily just say
 
05:07:09.958 --> 05:07:10.788 align:start position:0%
request to CMS who could easily just say
no

05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:07:12.590 --> 05:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
am I correct about that and number
 
05:07:14.570 --> 05:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
number one where do I find what the
 
05:07:16.670 --> 05:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
requirement actually is most of my
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion patients actually
 
05:07:20.690 --> 05:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
have a job so I assume that would
 
05:07:22.070 --> 05:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
qualify them
 
05:07:22.080 --> 05:07:23.150 align:start position:0%
qualify them
under

05:07:23.150 --> 05:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative Leon
 
05:07:27.830 --> 05:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um the work
 
05:07:31.368 --> 05:07:31.378 align:start position:0%
requirements are in 126 double a
 
05:07:34.430 --> 05:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
um it is for 100 hours a month based off
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
of the 25 hour work work week
 
05:07:37.680 --> 05:07:38.770 align:start position:0%
of the 25 hour work work week
um the

05:07:38.770 --> 05:07:38.780 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:07:42.650 --> 05:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
within within the language it includes
 
05:07:44.448 --> 05:07:44.458 align:start position:0%
um work in the private sector it
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
includes a number of different things
 
05:07:48.170 --> 05:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
and so it's very broad reaching even
 
05:07:50.810 --> 05:07:50.820 align:start position:0%
volunteering with a non-profit satisfies
 
05:07:53.090 --> 05:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
that watching your children or
 
05:07:55.310 --> 05:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
babysitting others satisfies that work
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
requirement it is very Broad and it
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
provides ample opportunity
 
05:08:09.410 --> 05:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:11.570 --> 05:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
and also our committee researcher has
 
05:08:13.010 --> 05:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
said that she could provide some more
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
information on work requirements for us
 
05:08:16.310 --> 05:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
as well for next week if that would be
 
05:08:19.310 --> 05:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
helpful I can find where the language is
 
05:08:20.810 --> 05:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
on these
 
05:08:22.868 --> 05:08:22.878 align:start position:0%
it's 126.
 
05:08:30.288 --> 05:08:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
and then also as as far as that goes
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
um the there's supposed to be an
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to cure if you're short on
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
the hours and this also is another area
 
05:08:44.448 --> 05:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed legislatively
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules with no
 
05:08:48.530 --> 05:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
grounding and statutes said that nobody
 
05:08:50.270 --> 05:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
can be asked to work more than 100 hours
 
05:08:53.090 --> 05:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
even if they're making up for a loss in
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
the previous month so as long as
 
05:08:56.570 --> 05:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
eventually you put in a month with 100
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
hours you're considered in compliance
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
and given that if you have basically a
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
doctor's note saying that you have a
 
05:09:06.650 --> 05:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
reason why you aren't able to
 
05:09:09.530 --> 05:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
participate that there's
 
05:09:09.540 --> 05:09:10.730 align:start position:0%
participate that there's
um

05:09:10.730 --> 05:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:13.070 --> 05:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
if there's a storm that keeps you from
 
05:09:15.170 --> 05:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
attending that you get waived hour for
 
05:09:18.170 --> 05:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
hour there's a lot of trade-offs as well
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
um and you know honestly as a mom I'm a
 
05:09:22.430 --> 05:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
little offended that the entire
 
05:09:24.170 --> 05:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
pregnancy period is considered a
 
05:09:24.180 --> 05:09:25.730 align:start position:0%
pregnancy period is considered a
disability

05:09:25.730 --> 05:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
disability
 
05:09:28.490 --> 05:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I I think that uh being able to
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
continue on with life and work during
 
05:09:32.810 --> 05:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
your pregnancy makes sense and the
 
05:09:35.090 --> 05:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
doctor's note during your pregnancy or
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
any other time saying that you're not
 
05:09:37.730 --> 05:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
able to work I think should be
 
05:09:39.530 --> 05:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
sufficient for anybody except that last
 
05:09:41.810 --> 05:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
week when you're saying oh my goodness
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's time
 
05:09:44.750 --> 05:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
um sorry I'm getting into another one
 
05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
that I have here I apologize for
 
05:09:49.430 --> 05:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
diverting my attention but we we have a
 
05:09:52.190 --> 05:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
very very generous program that allows
 
05:09:55.550 --> 05:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
for a lot of different things including
 
05:09:58.270 --> 05:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
on-the-job training education
 
05:10:00.590 --> 05:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
and participation in substance use
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
disorder treatment recovery activities
 
05:10:06.788 --> 05:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:09.230 --> 05:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
05:10:10.730 --> 05:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
um I would agree with representative
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
Leon that there's generous opportunities
 
05:10:16.090 --> 05:10:16.100 align:start position:0%
to be accepted if you have a problem
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
fulfilling the work requirement I
 
05:10:20.448 --> 05:10:20.458 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it's very generous on the
 
05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
other hand because I it was the most
 
05:10:25.610 --> 05:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
it was the most hours required of any
 
05:10:28.970 --> 05:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
waiver given in throughout the country
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
so the the requirements were the most
 
05:10:34.550 --> 05:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
extreme in the country
 
05:10:37.670 --> 05:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
um when when we did get that waiver
 
05:10:40.970 --> 05:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
um also I think that um in in regards to
 
05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
the discussion about
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
um maybe there being changes in federal
 
05:10:47.230 --> 05:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that would allow
 
05:10:50.990 --> 05:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
these kinds of waivers that has been
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
discussed in the news recently and was
 
05:10:56.230 --> 05:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
included in the house the federal house
 
05:10:58.868 --> 05:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
legislation that passed recently
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
regarding the debt limit but I don't
 
05:11:04.490 --> 05:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
think that anybody really expects that
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
that will become
 
05:11:06.718 --> 05:11:08.570 align:start position:0%
that will become
um

05:11:08.570 --> 05:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:10.550 --> 05:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know it's got a lot of steps to go
 
05:11:13.070 --> 05:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
before it comes law and it it doesn't
 
05:11:15.830 --> 05:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
seem like it's going to that's gonna
 
05:11:18.288 --> 05:11:18.298 align:start position:0%
happen at least in the way it was passed
 
05:11:20.590 --> 05:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
in the in the House of Representatives
 
05:11:23.810 --> 05:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
so it is it is being discussed on the
 
05:11:26.690 --> 05:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
national level but it's far from being a
 
05:11:26.700 --> 05:11:29.390 align:start position:0%
national level but it's far from being a
reality

05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:32.628 --> 05:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:35.208 --> 05:11:35.218 align:start position:0%
say no other discussion
 
05:11:37.250 --> 05:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
um so I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
05:11:39.490 --> 05:11:39.500 align:start position:0%
wall the motion is ought to pass on
 
05:11:45.170 --> 05:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
1620h amendment to Senate bill 263.

and the amendment fails nine to eleven
 
05:12:50.150 --> 05:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
okay at this point we might be pushing
 
05:12:51.590 --> 05:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
our luck with those of you who need to
 
05:12:51.600 --> 05:12:52.550 align:start position:0%
our luck with those of you who need to
leave

05:12:52.550 --> 05:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
leave
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
um shortly I do have a couple of
 
05:12:56.690 --> 05:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
announcements one I'll be sending out a
 
05:12:58.490 --> 05:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
list of the
 
05:13:00.410 --> 05:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
um retained bills that
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
um this just a number of us are
 
05:13:06.050 --> 05:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
wondering about them and we also need to
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh consider how we're going to handle
 
05:13:10.490 --> 05:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
those uh not and you know immediately
 
05:13:12.650 --> 05:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
but obviously those need to be on our
 
05:13:14.090 --> 05:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
radar screens and if we can start
 
05:13:16.250 --> 05:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
thinking about what areas we might be
 
05:13:19.368 --> 05:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
interested in working on those as as
 
05:13:20.810 --> 05:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
time passes
 
05:13:23.868 --> 05:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
also next week on the subcommittee on
 
05:13:26.448 --> 05:13:26.458 align:start position:0%

05:13:34.610 --> 05:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
be meeting at 10 A.M
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%

05:13:37.850 --> 05:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
committee will be meeting at
 
05:13:41.628 --> 05:13:41.638 align:start position:0%
um at 11 A.M right
 
05:13:44.708 --> 05:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
um and that is all I have
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
oh yes it'll be on next Wednesday the
 
05:13:48.350 --> 05:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
10th yes
 
05:13:51.170 --> 05:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman did we want to discuss about
 
05:13:51.180 --> 05:13:53.270 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman did we want to discuss about
238

05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
238
 
05:13:57.170 --> 05:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
about the floor Amendment there well
 
05:14:00.170 --> 05:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
um that wasn't really a noticed item for
 
05:14:02.690 --> 05:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
us so I don't want to be accused of
 
05:14:06.650 --> 05:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
doing a work session again but um what I
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
can do tomorrow is make an announcement
 
05:14:11.690 --> 05:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
of having a brief executive session at
 
05:14:13.250 --> 05:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
the on the floor I'm going to announce
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
that and then I guess that'll be Papa
 
05:14:16.610 --> 05:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
notice because we'll all be there anyway
 
05:14:16.620 --> 05:14:18.128 align:start position:0%
notice because we'll all be there anyway
so

05:14:18.128 --> 05:14:18.138 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:20.868 --> 05:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
I believe that is going to be
 
05:14:26.810 --> 05:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
heard on the floor on May 11th is that
 
05:14:31.670 --> 05:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
the case 238 yes uh yeah I've uh yes
 
05:14:34.250 --> 05:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
could we make the discussion of 238 for
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment during the work session next
 
05:14:36.718 --> 05:14:38.930 align:start position:0%
Amendment during the work session next
week

05:14:38.930 --> 05:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
week
 
05:14:43.128 --> 05:14:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:47.448 --> 05:14:47.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know would that be enough time
 
05:14:51.170 --> 05:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
to put it in the to discuss it on the 11
 
05:14:53.448 --> 05:14:53.458 align:start position:0%
the next day
 
05:14:56.570 --> 05:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
be a floor Amendment uh representative
 
05:14:58.610 --> 05:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
Leon uh thank you my only one concern
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
with that would be making sure that we
 
05:15:02.750 --> 05:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
could get it in time if everybody was
 
05:15:05.810 --> 05:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
was favorable of the change in language
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
um I I don't expect that it will I think
 
05:15:09.890 --> 05:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
we'll get an idea of whether or not it
 
05:15:12.350 --> 05:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
takes us more time and would then need
 
05:15:14.208 --> 05:15:14.218 align:start position:0%
to be announced and put in for a work
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
session on um next Wednesday if we're if
 
05:15:20.570 --> 05:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
we don't have an easy agreement
 
05:15:22.430 --> 05:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
um when we meet for five or five minutes
 
05:15:25.010 --> 05:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
or so I guess at lunch
 
05:15:27.110 --> 05:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at session that was my under my
 
05:15:27.120 --> 05:15:28.490 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at session that was my under my
thinking

05:15:28.490 --> 05:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
05:15:30.288 --> 05:15:30.298 align:start position:0%
if I heard it correctly I think it was
 
05:15:32.810 --> 05:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
grab some bland we have to notice the
 
05:15:34.850 --> 05:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
fact we're going to have a discussion
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
about it which is a work session
 
05:15:38.628 --> 05:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
so I guess the questions of the chair is
 
05:15:40.490 --> 05:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
do we have to notice it
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
so we can have the discussion on it next
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
week yeah work session has to be noticed
 
05:15:46.810 --> 05:15:46.820 align:start position:0%
in the calendar
 
05:15:50.510 --> 05:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
yeah uh Ms Dyer can you notice that for
 
05:15:50.520 --> 05:15:51.288 align:start position:0%
yeah uh Ms Dyer can you notice that for
us

05:15:51.288 --> 05:15:51.298 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:15:55.250 --> 05:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
a work session on that Amendment HP SB
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
238 yes and it will likely be a
 
05:15:59.990 --> 05:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
different amendment number but a work
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 238. if we're
 
05:16:05.390 --> 05:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
able to to notice that since we have
 
05:16:06.890 --> 05:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
already reported it would really be in a
 
05:16:08.208 --> 05:16:08.218 align:start position:0%
like it's going to end up being a floor
 
05:16:08.218 --> 05:16:10.490 align:start position:0%
like it's going to end up being a floor
Amendment

05:16:10.490 --> 05:16:10.500 align:start position:0%

that feasible
 
05:16:13.798 --> 05:16:15.890 align:start position:0%
that feasible

05:16:15.890 --> 05:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
