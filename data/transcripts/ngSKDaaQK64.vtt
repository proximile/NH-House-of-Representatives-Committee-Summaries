00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll take uh House Bill 130
 
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.009 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll take uh House Bill 130
first

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
all right so 130 has an amendment
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
um that uh even though the bill says
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to repeal this uh commission
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
altogether uh this amendment is to
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
address the problem that gel Carr uh
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
feels that exists in the current statute
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
and that is the funding mechanism and
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
the penalties
 
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
um are uh are inappropriate for a
 
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
commission and so this amendment uh
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
basically addresses just that issue it
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't repeal it it doesn't
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
change anything other than its funding
 
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.130 align:start position:0%
change anything other than its funding
mechanism

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
um I I guess the one thing that did come
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
up and I just want to make it clear to
 
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
everyone uh this bill is way past going
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
to a second committee so any action we
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
take uh if this if it does pass the
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
house and I'm hoping we'll all agree on
 
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.060 align:start position:0%
this and get another consent calendar
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
that uh it will then go over to the
 
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
Senate and and the Senate Commerce
 
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
Committee which Donna Susie sits on who
 
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:11.180 align:start position:0%
is the sponsor of the original
 
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
commission that uh that she can work on
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
it and fix it and if if she wants to do
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
something different different funding
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
mechanism obviously that's open for
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
discussion but at least this addresses
 
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
the fact that the governor has an
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill one but he doesn't have it
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in House Bill 2 to have
 
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
a funding mechanism so one way or the
 
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
other this language has to be approved
 
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
if we hope any money is going to fall go
 
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
to that commission this year
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions from the
 
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.329 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions from the
committee

00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:46.129 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to make clear that
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
the the um dalcar I don't know how to
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
pronounce it did not say that this was
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional they said they had no
 
00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:58.009 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional they said they had no
Authority

00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
um they said it should be looked at
 
00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:00.590 align:start position:0%
um they said it should be looked at
further

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
um though they had they did have say
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
that they had questions but they did not
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
say that it couldn't they expect thought
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
it should move forward and have some
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
more work done on it but they they were
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
recommending legislative action
 
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
and where the legislative policy
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
just question this doesn't uh in any way
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
negate the last Amendment does it we
 
00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
still have that last Amendment hanging
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
out there on 130 on 1 30 a.m what's the
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
last time the whole funding thing
 
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh that this this amendment's been
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
around for a while hasn't it uh yeah
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
the original 130 was to repeal the whole
 
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
law no no then there was an amendment uh
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
I can't tell that I don't have a name on
 
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.350 align:start position:0%
I can't tell that I don't have a name on
it

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
no you're talking okay so this would
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
negate any other Amendment this would be
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
the only amendment
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
oh well then I want to know what
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
happened this is 7 48 page
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
are you looking at 748h
 
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
yes yes that's what we're discussing
 
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
then what's
 
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.629 align:start position:0%
then what's
okay

00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the original bill
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
which was the repeal everything this is
 
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
how short it was
 
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah repeal could be very short
 
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:33.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
did she so she's looking at my Amendment
 
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.110 align:start position:0%
did she so she's looking at my Amendment
yeah

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
should we go back to looking at
 
00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:56.339 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants Amendment
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
which is what the board would like to do
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
if we don't retain
 
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.810 align:start position:0%
if we don't retain
uh

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh just did he have an amendment on this
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh yeah do you have anybody in their
 
00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
file have another amendment
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
I think he just came in and told us to
 
00:15:14.689 --> 00:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
kill the bill because he didn't want to
 
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
get rid of I mean I remember the hearing
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
was mostly about not getting rid of the
 
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.509 align:start position:0%
was mostly about not getting rid of the
commission

00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's what I remember
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.449 --> 00:15:46.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
do you have anything you can shed light
 
00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:52.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.009 --> 00:15:58.019 align:start position:0%
not on the the subcommittee so I know
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
but you can still you can still talk so
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
actually let me let me rephrase my
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
conversation okay uh I can see how this
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
is potentially a partisan issue in terms
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill and so therefore
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
um what I would guess what I'm looking
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
for is you know if the Democrats were
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
unified to say they're opposed to doing
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
anything and just to retain it then that
 
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
would be a 10-10 vote in this committee
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
and that would force it to be retained
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
so I was saying I was making a case for
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
because you all know I love to retain
 
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.590 align:start position:0%
because you all know I love to retain
bills

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know I like to keep keep bills in
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
committee but that I thought that given
 
00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
what happened with gel Carter and I was
 
00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:38.339 align:start position:0%
more than willing to retain it but given
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
what happened in gel car I thought it
 
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
was worthwhile to go forward with this
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
so that least we have addressed the
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
legislative issue and then let the
 
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
Senate decide what they want to do with
 
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.990 align:start position:0%
Senate decide what they want to do with
it

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
from the from the policy point of view
 
00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
of course I would like to keep the the
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
commission from the the state
 
00:16:58.129 --> 00:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
constitutional point of view
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know and uh you don't hear me
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
say I don't know that often but I don't
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know uh but from the policy
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
point of view of course I would like to
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
and I want to know your opinion
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
kind of want to know your opinion you're
 
00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
talking to me yeah oh okay
 
00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:33.470 align:start position:0%
talking to me yeah oh okay
um

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
I would like us to retain it um that is
 
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
what the board would like us to do they
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
think it's the best option
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
um their second choice I guess there
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't uh there was confusion I guess
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
they thought Gary Merchant had us as an
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and their third choice would
 
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.590 align:start position:0%
amendment and their third choice would
be

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
um they don't think that the general
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
fund is going to be um the way to go so
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
their first choice is to retain and I
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
frankly would like to to take their lead
 
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
on that and go with that and um if
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
people you know are confused we can take
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
five minutes as a caucus to talk but I'd
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
so beautiful
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
so who said you agreed you think it you
 
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
would rather just do you realize it
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
means the commission won't theoretically
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
so do you want us to support the
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
amendment yes
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
the bill States repealing the drug
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
affordability yeah that we it would
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
change the title if we were to pass this
 
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:39.299 align:start position:0%
amendment that would change that a title
 
00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:46.250 align:start position:0%
amendment that would change that a title
okay

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended then we're not
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
repealing the repealing the drug the
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
repeal language will disappear
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
forever ever that's my commitment to you
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay my commitment to you personal
 
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
commitment okay as much as I'm not very
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
excited about this this affordability
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
board that I would I by passing this
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
amendment I am saying to you is that
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
that any conversation about repealing it
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
will not be in this committee
 
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
this committee will not talk about
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
repealing it it will be gone that's not
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
the issue to us the issue to us was we
 
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
never got to see it when it originally
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
got passed
 
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
okay because it was in the it was in the
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
budget and it was it came over from the
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
Senate side so it never really uh it
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
never came to our committee and said
 
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
whether we thought this funding
 
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.750 align:start position:0%
whether we thought this funding
mechanism

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
was an appropriate mechanism okay and
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no it's not it's not
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I'm not ready to repeal
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
the whole thing just because the funding
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
mechanism doesn't work
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
I'm doing what I think is the
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
responsible thing to do is fix the
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
now you can argue well you know that
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
that you know this is not going to see
 
00:19:59.090 --> 00:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
the light of day but I would argue there
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
I will guarantee you what I know about
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
the Senate is that the Senate did is
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
committed to this affordability board
 
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
and the Senate it when that when the
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
budget comes back
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate will have the money now
 
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
whether in the committee a conference
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate is willing to go to the
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
carpet over this versus what other
 
00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:24.299 align:start position:0%
issues may be differential between the
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
you know that who knows nobody's got
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
nobody's got that crystal ball
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
but I would say to you that if by doing
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
this you now ended any discussion on the
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
house side about repealing it
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
and what you're doing instead is is
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
creating a funding mechanism the gel car
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
would approve
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
and keeping this this issue alive
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
because when it leaves here it's going
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
to the Senate
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
but how do we know it's going to pass
 
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
the Senate when Donna soucy didn't know
 
00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
anything about it I mean I understand
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
that they don't have the majority but I
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure Donna Susie who's not
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
paying attention to all the bills that
 
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:06.419 align:start position:0%
are on the house side
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
um I I take I take you think she does
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I do okay well I mean I I I I would
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know you went on me being frank
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
I am surprised that Tom Sherman did not
 
00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:21.059 align:start position:0%
tell her this issue was on the house
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
side that we had two of these bills I'm
 
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.470 align:start position:0%
side that we had two of these bills I'm
shocked

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
shocked
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
I mean he's a former Senator he should
 
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
he knows full well how important this
 
00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
did she tell you it was important to her
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
Sherman oh you never talked to her okay
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
so you're you're getting her surprise
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
second hand okay
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me I trust what Tom Sherman says
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
he's an honorable man and I trust
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
whenever he tells me something like that
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
she was shocked yes okay
 
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
um just for clarity uh
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
this bill is not going to the finance
 
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
committee that is for sure
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
it would the only time the finance
 
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
committee will ever see this issue
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
is that if the Senate were to amend it
 
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
and come back and again it would come
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
back to us it wouldn't go back to
 
00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
finance my assumption is by our passing
 
00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:25.310 align:start position:0%
finance my assumption is by our passing
this

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
that the Senate will make sure this is
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
in their budget when they send the
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
that is my assumption again my
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
assumption would be if they send it back
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
to finance that it'll be taken out
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
okay but that would be in the committee
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
conference and if for it to be taken out
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
that means the Senate got something else
 
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
if anyone doesn't in our caucus doesn't
 
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
have any more questions I'd like to meet
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
in the hall or what we can do we don't
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
have to do that you guys go ahead and
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
caucus and we'll make that decision when
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
we have the full commitment okay okay
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
all right and that and that will be
 
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
similar to the next one okay so the next
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
one is we don't need a subcommittee the
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
well you're on camera yeah
 
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:42.470 align:start position:0%
well you're on camera yeah
no no

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is uh five what's
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
the bill number
 
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.710 align:start position:0%
the bill number
513.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
okay so my understanding is there
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
there's two two pieces here the Salient
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
items in this build
 
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.330 align:start position:0%
um there is
the

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
uh RSA the 420b27 Roman numeral two
 
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.149 align:start position:0%
uh RSA the 420b27 Roman numeral two
B

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
B
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement is equal to the
 
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
payment which would have otherwise been
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
made to the payer's preferred Pharmacy
 
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.049 align:start position:0%
made to the payer's preferred Pharmacy
provider

00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
isn't that ironic okay
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
um so obviously to me that is a very
 
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
important sentence given that while we
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
heard in the public hearing was that
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
cancer treatments and infusions are are
 
00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:36.110 align:start position:0%
cancer treatments and infusions are are
overbilled

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
overbilled
 
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
and base because they're built under the
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
medical rather than the pharmaceutical
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
so to me that's the most important part
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
of this build the third Roman numeral
 
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
three uh where a patient may opt to do
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
this bagging brown white or whatever bag
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
you want to call it that um my
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
understanding is this is actually
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
current policy you know that this this
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
happens now so we don't really need to
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
pass that
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
so if that's offensive to people we can
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
take it out
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
and just and just not and go forward
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
with the bill without Roman numeral
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
three I can I can just I just want to
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
tell you why I think it's should be
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
taken out which is that right now and
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
Karen and we have another nurse here too
 
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
can can tell me over there I'm all wet
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
um right now
 
00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:25.789 align:start position:0%
um right now
um

00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
it's it right now the opt-in thing is
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
usually on a piece of paper in small
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
print that only Carrie would read
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
um because we know she reads the man
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
right and she's the smaller the print
 
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
the more suspicious he is but that's
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
what patients get
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
no they don't aren't aware that they're
 
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
that the uh if they opt into this that
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a cheaper
 
00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:51.299 align:start position:0%
um way of paying and that's to the
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
hospital's advantage and it seems like
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
the way to do it would be to have the
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
default be to have a go to the patient
 
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
and then tell them well by the way you
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
can also get it here but here's the cost
 
00:26:03.179 --> 00:26:05.269 align:start position:0%
can also get it here but here's the cost
differential

00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
differential
 
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
that's my take on that paragraph it's an
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
interesting concept to turn from an
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
opt-in to opt out or something but yeah
 
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.210 align:start position:0%
opt-in to opt out or something but yeah
okay

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
no I I truly believe I agree with you
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
that the process is happening now in
 
00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059 align:start position:0%
terms of what's the roles the hospital
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
play is correct it's the right way and
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's really safe and sound and the idea
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
that you're getting it delivered and
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
having it it's it it seems a little
 
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
tacky to me they haven't had problems
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
with it yeah well so exactly it is it is
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
there so let me say is if it is already
 
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
current even if we don't pass that it
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
can still occur
 
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
because it's already something that's
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
happening so all we're doing is putting
 
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:48.419 align:start position:0%
in statue with something that's already
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
happening so I agree with you let's just
 
00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
take it out
 
00:26:51.659 --> 00:26:54.490 align:start position:0%
take it out
okay

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:54.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to do is I'm trying
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
to get something that we all can agree
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
on you know because I you know how much
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
I love everything on the consent
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
calendar which so far is everything we
 
00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gibbs thank you
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
um uh this is actually a question for
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs um I understand
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
clearly your point about
 
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.230 align:start position:0%
clearly your point about
um

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
the savings and expense
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
um but my question is about what we
 
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
heard during the hearing about the
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
concerns about safety in terms of having
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
the medication sent to the patients and
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
then carried by the patients to the
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
hospital or where or wherever
 
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
I guess I interpreted things differently
 
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know if um
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
I talked to somebody from the New
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association is anyone
 
00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:46.700 align:start position:0%
from there today
 
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
both of them are here yeah I mean and I
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
I don't I I'm not sure they would agree
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
with you that it's dangerous and um
 
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
um I mean they can tell me whether I'm
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
all wet but that's why what we did here
 
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
was that the service that delivers the
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
medication to the patient is often the
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
same service that delivers it to the
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
hospital exactly
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
and so and people have been receiving
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
their insulin forever in the you know
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
however they get their insulin they
 
00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
weren't able to give us numbers that
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's they usually give it to them in a
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
packaging that can get it to the
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
hospital because remember the hospitals
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay maybe I I misunderstood
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
what I heard
 
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony from
 
00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:48.419 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure whether it was a
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association but it was Health
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
Care Providers they were concerned about
 
00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:57.059 align:start position:0%
the safety of the two-step process
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
because of the extra length of time
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
um in terms of of getting the medication
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the person who would administer it
 
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
which is different from insulin because
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
right and Insulin goes to the patient
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
the patient injections I think that's
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
only if the Good Humor man delivers it
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
but um I'm sorry I'm jumping around
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
um refrigerated yeah it is refrigerated
 
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
does the new New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.110 align:start position:0%
does the new New Hampshire Hospital
Association

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
but yeah here's what what I heard was it
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
goes to the patient and then the patient
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
takes the time to deliver it to the
 
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
hospital so that's the difference
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
between the Brown Bag during that step
 
00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:35.510 align:start position:0%
between the Brown Bag during that step
that

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
that's the question that that one is
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
really yes we we would most most of us
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
would be very concerned if it was being
 
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
delivered to the to the patient at their
 
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
home and then they were responsible to
 
00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:48.539 align:start position:0%
bring it in yes we all agree that that
 
00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:51.419 align:start position:0%
is uh is is a little scary well I I
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
think that's okay that's the possibility
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
here so I my understanding and I and I
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
you know can't tell you we could
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
certainly open it up the whole reason
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
this concept exists in the first place
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
is going back to the problem of what we
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
want to fix in B which is that the
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
patient wanted the patient finds out for
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
some reason the patients got some skin
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
in the game when it came to that medical
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
billing and saw the outrageous price and
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
they said how do I get out of that well
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
they say is well if we deliver it to you
 
00:30:30.409 --> 00:30:30.419 align:start position:0%
and you bring it in then you will make
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
sure that it is will be paid under the
 
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.330 align:start position:0%
sure that it is will be paid under the
pharmacy

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh provision
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
of their health insurance rather than
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
the medical which was doing the
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
overcharging in the first place
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
so that I'm saying is if we pass this
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
that I don't think there will be anybody
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
who will bother doing this Roman numeral
 
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
3 anymore because we've taken care of
 
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
why they would do it in the first place
 
00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
which was the lower the costs for the
 
00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
which was the lower the costs for the
drug

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
drug
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
would you mind if we asked the hospital
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
association their take on this not a
 
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:14.210 align:start position:0%
association their take on this not a
problem

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.789 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
hospital Association and Paula minahan
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
Senior vice president state government
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
relations for the hospital Association
 
00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify what um was being
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
asked about Brown bagging and white
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
bagging so just again to set the stage
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
so Brown bagging is the insurance
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
company's policy that requires a patient
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
to receive their medication at home
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
and they have to bring it to a hospital
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
or a provider for that hospital or
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
provider to administer it to them
 
00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
the problem with the brown bagging is
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
that if the patient receives it either
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
late or the medication is wrong or it's
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
not stored properly that's the patient
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
safety concern that we have with brown
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
bagging with white bagging the
 
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
medication on behalf of a particular
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
patient gets sent to the hospital or
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
health care provider
 
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't come through the normal
 
00:32:24.529 --> 00:32:24.539 align:start position:0%
chain of drug shipments it gets sent to
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
a shipping Department it may get sent to
 
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
another department especially if there's
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
no special tag on it or it may have a
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
patient name and they don't know who the
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
doctor is so sometimes it also gets lost
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
temperature not maintained and so forth
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
so that is why we have special concerns
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
about both Brown bagging and white
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
bagging there are certain circumstances
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
where white banking does make sense
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
depending on the particular patient and
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
the circumstance with that provider but
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
really what the concern that we have
 
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
with this bill is is the funding
 
00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
mechanism that you've pointed out Mr
 
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.830 align:start position:0%
mechanism that you've pointed out Mr
chairman

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
concern here and I know that the sponsor
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
actually said this but we're not sure
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
that it's actually
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
written correctly in this amendment is
 
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
that he hopes that this whole process
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
for brown bagging gets put to an uh
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy benefit instead of a medical
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
benefit and as I mentioned to this
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
committee last week we are concerned
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
with a pharmacy benefit that the patient
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
is going to have more out-of-pocket
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
costs because typically Pharmacy
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
benefits have higher deductibles and
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
higher co-pays regardless of charges so
 
00:33:39.009 --> 00:33:39.019 align:start position:0%
I also want to clarify with charges
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
hospitals Providers Insurance companies
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
have contracts regardless of what is
 
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
charged the reimbursement is what is
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
under contract that's not what they get
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
paid so let's be clear the payments are
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
negotiated between the provider
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
and the insurance company and the
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
patient also benefits from that
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
so so your sounds like you you agree
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
with that's removed paragraph This Roman
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
numeral three and that that b uh again
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
only reaffirms what you think is already
 
00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.129 align:start position:0%
only reaffirms what you think is already
happening

00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
I don't understand what b means to be
 
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.310 align:start position:0%
I don't understand what b means to be
honest

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
honest
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is not written very
 
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
carefully it is not clear that this is
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
truly going to a pharmacy benefit I know
 
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
what the sponsor said but the the way
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's written is extremely unclear we
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
just don't think this bill is ready for
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
prime time and we think that this bill
 
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419 align:start position:0%
should be itl right well I I obviously
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
you say I disagreed I know exactly what
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
the bill is saying when it says the
 
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
payers preferred Pharmacy provider
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's directly referral to what's on my
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
little health insurance card
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
and that is that negotiated rate between
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:05.339 align:start position:0%
so theoretically we're just reiterating
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
which should already be true
 
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.890 align:start position:0%
which should already be true
so

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
where are you again what line I am well
 
00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:16.820 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at numbers but
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
22 no excuse 20. 20. but that's why I
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
always do rsas because sometimes people
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
print them out but yes 20. um
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
so there's the reimbursement and then
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
there's the benefit and that's where I
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
think it is confusing
 
00:35:32.579 --> 00:35:34.609 align:start position:0%
think it is confusing
um

00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
I I find this very confusing and as you
 
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
know we discuss you have a better way to
 
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
say it
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
the implications the unintended
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
consequences potential um
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
um the potential impact negative impact
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
um not not only to the patient but also
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
to the to the provider
 
00:35:59.930 --> 00:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
um are are significant this is confusing
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and I again as Kathy indicated we do
 
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
not believe this bill is is written in a
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
way that we can certainly understand it
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this for a long time and
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
Kathy even longer so I I I'm struggling
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
with this as well I don't know if this
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
means I think this is rate setting um
 
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
and I you and I have talked about this
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
this is rate setting because you're
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
setting a rate that is not that is
 
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
outside the contracts between the
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
carriers and the providers because it is
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
setting a rate that is the provide the
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
hospital at least in the hospitals they
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
don't negotiate a pharmacy benefit per
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
se unless you own a specialty pharmacy
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
so it is all falls under the medical
 
00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
benefit and again as Kathy indicated
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a private negotiation
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
between a carrier and a meniscus for our
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
in our in our members case hospitals so
 
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
I'm still very I'm struggling I really
 
00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
am um with with how this would be
 
00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
um administered and but this is I think
 
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's rate setting because it's you're
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
defaulting to a rate that had that falls
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
under the pharmacy benefit that is
 
00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:15.140 align:start position:0%
set I guess between the PBM and the
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
insurer that may or may they may
 
00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:20.579 align:start position:0%
actually own the PBM so that's the rate
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals would be required
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
under this to default to that's rate
 
00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.430 align:start position:0%
under this to default to that's rate
setting

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
setting
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
that's that's the the legislature would
 
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
be setting the rates by doing that in
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
our the way we read it so I think there
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
are a lot of potential unintended
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
I just want to thank you for saying it
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
was confusing because I had a headache
 
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
after reading it 20 times and I thought
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
that I just simply wasn't that bright
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
which it doesn't mean that isn't true
 
00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
but I couldn't figure it out that I I
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
find it very confusing and you are very
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
bright so um yeah I I struggle with this
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
language I do
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
but I guess yeah so we have a we have a
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
replacement here who's a nurse yeah
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
from Goffstown uh District 29. and I'm a
 
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
nurse and I've been a nurse for many
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
years I do find this very confusing
 
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
um this bill and the big thing is is
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
what you're saying exactly with about
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
the brown bagging or white bagging I
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
think it has a lot of safety concerns
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the patient I think basically as we
 
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
know that the meal delivery sometimes
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
can be late you could have
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
um it placed somewhere say if you did
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
the white bagging it could be placed
 
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
somewhere and then it's not brought up
 
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
to the floor or brought to where it
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be and um and that's a big
 
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
problem and also I think also in regards
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
this reimbursement and everything like
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
that I think is also very confusing I I
 
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
don't feel that this bill is ready for
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
prime time
 
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.150 align:start position:0%
prime time
okay

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much you're welcome so
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh the last thing when we talked about
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
this we had tasked the insurance
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
department with uh coming up because the
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
question was posed by the medical
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
society that this was confusing or also
 
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
whether that uh this the consumers would
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
be her uh the patients would be harmed
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
based upon co-pays and deductibles I
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
think is what it was the question that
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
was posed so is the department prepared
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
to uh tell us what they think about that
 
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.589 align:start position:0%
to uh tell us what they think about that
problem

00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
and I guess add into it um is is this
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
sentence confusing for you or do you you
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
know how you would be able to enforce
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
this and do you consider it uh uh rate
 
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:58.849 align:start position:0%
this and do you consider it uh uh rate
setting

00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
okay so Alex why don't you
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah just talk to the mic because we
 
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
have one person oh yeah I'm Alex valve
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
from the insurance examiner four from
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
the insurance department
 
00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.630 align:start position:0%
the insurance department
and

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
um we were asked to take a look at the
 
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
amendment and effectively
 
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.210 align:start position:0%
amendment and effectively
um

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
do the work of uh producing a fiscal
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
note for that Amendment
 
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.609 align:start position:0%
note for that Amendment
um

00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:43.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:43.619 --> 00:40:45.530 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
um as pointed out in the memo that you
 
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.849 align:start position:0%
um as pointed out in the memo that you
have

00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
um they're basically three methods of
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
delivering specialty drugs
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
um the first one is the buy and Bill
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
method which is associated with the
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
highest costs
 
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
and health carriers in an effort to
 
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
control those high costs have developed
 
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
relationships with specialty pharmacies
 
00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:20.339 align:start position:0%
and as you now I think understand there
 
00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:23.900 align:start position:0%
are two ways that those um
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
clinician and Minister drugs get
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
delivered by specialty pharmacies either
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
directly to the clinic called White
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
bagging or through the patient called
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
um the most expensive again method is
 
00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:42.380 align:start position:0%
buying Bill
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
and what section two of this bill
 
00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
would do is basically
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
require the health carrier to reimburse
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
in the buy and Bill method so that's the
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
coverage requirement if you look at that
 
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.349 align:start position:0%
coverage requirement if you look at that
line

00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:42:00.359 --> 00:42:01.910 align:start position:0%
line
um

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.770 align:start position:0%
um
915

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
915
 
00:42:07.329 --> 00:42:07.339 align:start position:0%
it says an HMO
 
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
shall not refuse to authorize approve or
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
clinician administered drugs given
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
certain conditions so it's a coverage
 
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.950 align:start position:0%
certain conditions so it's a coverage
requirement

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
on the health carrier
 
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
so that's the benefit part of it and
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
then as a condition condition for that
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
coverage requirement
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
you have the most importantly of section
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
B which requires that it the
 
00:42:37.569 --> 00:42:37.579 align:start position:0%
reimbursement be equal to
 
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
the what the reimbursement would have
 
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
been for white bagging arrangement
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
so it's sort of a compromise and we in
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
the sense that it requires the carriers
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
um but at the same time it provides that
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
that method won't be more expensive than
 
00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:05.339 align:start position:0%
the current option of white bagging
 
00:43:05.339 --> 00:43:07.250 align:start position:0%
the current option of white bagging
so

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
um given that's what the bill does
 
00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.329 align:start position:0%
um given that's what the bill does
um

00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
our analysis is that it would lead to a
 
00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
lowering of claims costs and therefore
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
would lead to
 
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from committee
 
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.470 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from committee
members

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you uh
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
would your analysis of lower premiums
 
00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
apply both to the original Bill and to
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was submitted by
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
do I don't
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
the department Christopher sorry yeah
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
you got to put yes Chris the gallopolis
 
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of insurance department
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
the department had some concerns with
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
the language of the original bill and we
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
worked with the sponsor and other
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
interested people to to flesh all that
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
out and so our fiscal analysis was not
 
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
on the original bill which we would have
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
different testimony for but is on uh the
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
language of the bill here
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think it would be
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
impacted by I know there was some
 
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
conversation about whether or not we
 
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
take out as a paragraph to see uh the
 
00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:21.140 align:start position:0%
final tariff I don't think
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think our analysis would be
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
changed about whether or not that came
 
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
the expression I wouldn't have gotten
 
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.109 align:start position:0%
the expression I wouldn't have gotten
this

00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement is equal to the
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
payment which would have otherwise been
 
00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
made to the payer's preferred Pharmacy
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
provider correct so do the hospitals
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
know what that is
 
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
oh that's right I got to write you're
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
claiming that sentence is confusing okay
 
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
they they feel a little a little fuzzy
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
about what that sentence means and
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't mean
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
I mean the amount of money
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
oh the amount of money yes so if I'm
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
gonna say all right I'm gonna I'm gonna
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
have the the I'm going to provide the uh
 
00:45:21.359 --> 00:45:23.150 align:start position:0%
have the the I'm going to provide the uh
drugs

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
but I can only charge so much amount of
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
money do they not even know what that is
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative Spirit they'd have to
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
provide that information they wouldn't
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
know it today because this isn't the law
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
today and I think in large part this is
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
this is a solution to a very small part
 
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
of the Specialty Pharmacy solution I
 
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
think what the the number one solution
 
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
is for providers that are providing
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
these specialty drugs and the carriers
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
to enter into contracts just like they
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
do with everything else exactly and I've
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
seen you know I've been commissioned now
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
for three years and I've I've watched a
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
number of these uh
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
negotiations happen and that is by far
 
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
the most effective way where they can
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
balance all of the interest of all of
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
the parties and in those cases they
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
agree to some some kind of contractual
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
fee schedule between the two of them
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
um one of the wild cards there and for
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
those folks that don't agree to that you
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
know kind of carrot and stick you need a
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism for how you're going to deal
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
with it one of those mechanisms is brown
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
bagging and white bagging then what we
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
hear is well for some of this specialty
 
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
cancer treatment we don't know what the
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
concoction is or we don't know the
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
volume until that morning
 
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:35.339 align:start position:0%
we heard that over over the this last
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
year and so this bill deals with that
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
one kind of the last minute we need to
 
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:41.579 align:start position:0%
change the dosage we need to change the
 
00:46:41.579 --> 00:46:42.770 align:start position:0%
change the dosage we need to change the
volume

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
volume
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
here we go guys we're going to now it's
 
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
not on the fee schedule or you opted not
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
to have a contracted fee schedule here's
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
the solution you can provide it patient
 
00:46:52.329 --> 00:46:52.339 align:start position:0%
number one that's our goal for everyone
 
00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:55.700 align:start position:0%
and here's the the reimbursement amount
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
I think this is a this I've testified
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
now a second time on this bill I think
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
this is a wonderful solution to the
 
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
problems have been outlined as it
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
relates to Brown Value white bagging But
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately continues to provide the
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
incentive for the providers and the
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
carriers to negotiate all of this
 
00:47:14.089 --> 00:47:14.099 align:start position:0%
um and I think I think if we pass this
 
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you uh would
 
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
you believe that not when a procedure is
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
a medical procedure is performed neither
 
00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
the doctors nor the nurses nor the
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
technicians ever know what the actual
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
cost to the patient is going to be and I
 
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:41.180 align:start position:0%
know this because I almost always ask
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
and they almost always say
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
the billing department will tell you
 
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
when they've talked to the insurance
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
company and figured it out
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
I would believe I agree
 
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
he very much agrees
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions to the committee members okay
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
team none
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry that some providers know
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
not only the costs but exactly what
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
conditions those particular medications
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
need to be kept under in order for them
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to be administered safely
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
know the cost yes and I I believe I
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
believe you but I have never run into
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
one in my entire life literally never I
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
wish I had
 
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.650 align:start position:0%
wish I had
okay

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
um so uh this this is the same situation
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
you guys go ahead and and caucus and see
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
where you guys are with this
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
um I I would say that you know us
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
Republicans uniformly we want to pass
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
both these bills and so you just you
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
know if you if if you want me to take
 
00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
this paragraph out I just need to know
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
sooner yeah I just need to know sooner
 
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
or later to figure out what to do sure
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
great go ahead
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
perfect and we Republicans will caucus
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
I think everybody
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is we'll take up the two
 
01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
bills uh the first one house bill 130
 
01:14:57.890 --> 01:14:57.900 align:start position:0%

01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:39.860 align:start position:0%
and chairman hunt yes
 
01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
17. okay
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
Lisa post is here all right one more
 
01:18:44.159 --> 01:18:45.169 align:start position:0%
Lisa post is here all right one more
action

01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:56.930 align:start position:0%
 
post

01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay so the vote was 18. okay the Last
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
Action is
 
01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:05.900 align:start position:0%
um the house bill
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
584 uh there has some new information
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
has come available and so uh We've uh we
 
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
would like to reconsider our action
 
01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
where we passed it but
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
almost University I think there was one
 
01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:25.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
well you would you like this part but uh
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
so anyway so the motion uh is to
 
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
reconsider our action on House Bill 584
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
the motion being made by representative
 
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.390 align:start position:0%
the motion being made by representative
Ammon

01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
Ammon
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
second by representative hunt I think I
 
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
need to get
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think you really would have them
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
so this is the article 12 the UCC bill
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
and we actually passed the main UCC Bill
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
last year but this was a a patchwork of
 
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
little things that have come up uh but
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
then it turns out that there was a a
 
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
little bit of a poison pill in there and
 
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
so we want to remove that poison pill to
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh so that we have a nice clean UCC
 
01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:14.420 align:start position:0%
statute and I just lost my clerk
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon explain that
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
actually we can vote on it because we
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
could we don't need to have a roll call
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
vote I can we can do that by far I'll
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
speak to it once whenever it's okay so
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
all those in favor reconsideration
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
please say aye those opposed
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay almost your names all right so now
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative you can go ahead and
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion right so I passed
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
around two pieces of paper one is
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
amendment to 584 and
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
it strikes a section in the original
 
01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:44.510 align:start position:0%
it strikes a section in the original
bill

01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay I passed them that way maybe
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
they're right here is this it this this
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
is them
 
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
you can't see actually I need one
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
so there's there's two pieces of paper
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
one is uh right an amendment and the
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:09.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.649 --> 01:21:53.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay so okay I think everyone's got the
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
GPS everybody's got it and
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative Anderson recognized to
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
speak to his motion all right so uh UCC
 
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
12 there's been some controversy in the
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
news recently about uh UCC article 12
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
the governor of South Dakota just vetoed
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
their entire bill
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
and it's based on uh many misconceptions
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
about what UCC 12 does
 
01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
we passed that we passed a very near
 
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
final draft of UCC 12 last term last
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
year actually
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
and so 584 is just a cleanup bill it's
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
just to uh make a few minor changes
 
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
mostly minor changes to the final draft
 
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
that the uniform law commission produced
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
and what we passed last year so 584 is
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
it's a housekeeping Bill like in the
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
truest sense
 
01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
but they added one definition uh that to
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
the definition of money and if there's a
 
01:22:54.649 --> 01:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
second piece of paper here the language
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
in bold
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
is going to be would be added by 584 to
 
01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
our statute the language that is not in
 
01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
bold is already in statute
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
and so the amendment is to just strike
 
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
this out leave it leave current statute
 
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh the definite definition of money
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
leave it as is and we'll consider adding
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
this separately This this term so the
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
language that would be added unless we
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
Act is the term includes a monetary unit
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
of account established by an
 
01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental organization or
 
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
pursuant to an agreement between two or
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
more countries and
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
the use for this would be a central bank
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
digital currency an intergovernmental
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
organization could be the IMF or some
 
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
you know some Global organization uh
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
pursuant to an agreement between two or
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
more countries we've heard that China
 
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
and Russia and potentially Iran might be
 
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
working on their own banking system so
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
that would fall under this definition we
 
01:23:56.209 --> 01:23:56.219 align:start position:0%
want to be careful about uh introducing
 
01:23:59.689 --> 01:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
this into our statute without a uh you
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
know a reasoned uh discussion about it
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
so when the bill moves to the Senate we
 
01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
could have it then or we can we have one
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
retained bill that is meant to address
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
Central Bank digital currencies we
 
01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
retain that one here in this committee
 
01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
so that might be a vehicle to use to
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
sort of get this right but
 
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
um so I would ask everyone to just
 
01:24:21.169 --> 01:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
support this amendment and make this the
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment and then we can put
 
01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
put the bill back on consent so what's
 
01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
my request
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay any discussion on the motion yes
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative spear not for nothing
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
no way do I want this this to be
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
attached to that Central Bank currency
 
01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:39.470 align:start position:0%
attached to that Central Bank currency
thing

01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
so you do right you would you agree with
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
getting Central Bank out of this bill
 
01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:45.530 align:start position:0%
getting Central Bank out of this bill
right

01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
I would do it the way we want to do it
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.199 --> 01:24:54.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Ammon second by
 
01:24:59.630 --> 01:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative hunt moves uh
 
01:25:10.729 --> 01:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:11.890 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:11.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:23.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out that the last
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
last session I spoke against the
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
community particles and the vote I think
 
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
was 150 to 100
 
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
so there is
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh This is Not By Any Means
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
a unanimous effort
 
01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
because there are 150 votes there were
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
and I still am very much against
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
it could you put your sound on yeah I'm
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
sorry your microphone yeah I'm sorry I
 
01:26:00.649 --> 01:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
pull it close to you
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
so my my opposition is uh comprehensive
 
01:26:10.729 --> 01:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
in other words I reject
 
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
what we passed in the last session
 
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
and I I therefore reject
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
anything that is associated with uh and
 
01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:26.300 align:start position:0%
and has the capability of disrupting
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
our Constitution and and the
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
Congressional Monopoly over the uh money
 
01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:33.770 align:start position:0%
Congressional Monopoly over the uh money
supply

01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
supply
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
right in the Constitution and it's there
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
a monetary Sovereign Nation is one
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
nation and has one currency
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
and there's a reason for that you can't
 
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:50.219 align:start position:0%
control the money supply if there is a
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
private currency that has been
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
recognized as a substitute for our
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
dollar and that is what all of this is
 
01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
dollar and that is what all of this is
about

01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so I I reject the concept and I'm I
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
understand a lot of people are very
 
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
interested in cryptocurrencies and and
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
the ecology that's there and uh it's a
 
01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
nice shiny Bible and it's it's code and
 
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
it's like cool and that's sexy now but
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
currency is a is a thing that goes back
 
01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:26.540 align:start position:0%
500 600 years or more and has withstood
 
01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh uh ups and downs
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to vote to
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
compromise the money supply and the
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
Monopoly of Congress that's in the
 
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
Constitution and that's what I'm being
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
asked to do I'm not going to do it so it
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
sounds like to me that you agree with
 
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
this amendment because you think there
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
should only be one currency for the
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
United States government even though you
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
might vote against the bill
 
01:27:58.850 --> 01:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
in general but you really do support
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment because you don't like
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
the idea of any government entity having
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
their own digital currency what this is
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
all about it's a private currency that
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
is what is wanted and this is a
 
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
government one
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
do you think it's a good idea that the
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
gov the federal government have its own
 
01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:17.219 align:start position:0%
digital currency
 
01:28:19.129 --> 01:28:19.139 align:start position:0%
and what's the dollar is that the dollar
 
01:28:19.139 --> 01:28:20.570 align:start position:0%
and what's the dollar is that the dollar
no

01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
do you think it'd be okay for them to
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
create a new one but it is based on the
 
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
dollar it is still based on the dollar
 
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
you think so it is if you read the
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve notes it is still based
 
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
on the dollar it is not a separate
 
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
currency it's a separate instantiation
 
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
of the dollar gotcha okay private
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
currency and it will be outside the
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
banking it is not outside the banking
 
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
system and it is not a private currency
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative spear I mean
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent thank you
 
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh Mr chairman
 
01:28:56.570 --> 01:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
um I would have to agree to some point
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh and maybe I'm wrong but this is just
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
to purchase this and correct me if I'm
 
01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:06.950 align:start position:0%
to purchase this and correct me if I'm
wrong

01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:29:09.890 --> 01:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
this is an online type of deal correct
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
to purchase this currency would be
 
01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
online can I just clarification here
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
sure please so UCC article 12 deals with
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
digital assets so they call them
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
controllable electronic records it
 
01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
encompasses a ton of different things so
 
01:29:26.209 --> 01:29:26.219 align:start position:0%
it could be any any digital token that
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
you can trade online it can include
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency but it conclude it can
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
include a whole bunch of other things
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
right um so it's it's a very broad
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
category but it has to do with value
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's represented by a digital token
 
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
and these are becoming widespread in
 
01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
lots of different use cases
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
um you know Chuck E cheese issues its
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
own money but it's not a threat to the
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
US dollar right right so you know a
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
digital token can be something simple
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
like a token to use to operate a system
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
online like a video game system my
 
01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
comment is not against it it's just that
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
um I think when you're talking about
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
digital currency it's worldwide
 
01:30:05.209 --> 01:30:05.219 align:start position:0%
so it's not just to the United States
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
that's what my comment was it goes
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
wherever the internet goes that's
 
01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
correct yeah in that case it's true yes
 
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:12.590 align:start position:0%
correct yeah in that case it's true yes
representative

01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
just as a point of clarification we're
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
discussing right now whether the
 
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to ought to pass because
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
already last week
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass the underlying Bill
 
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
correct and the sole question here is
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
whether we agree that the underlying
 
01:30:28.729 --> 01:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
bill should not recognize digital
 
01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
currencies is that the question before
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
us right now
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
government digital currency yes thank
 
01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
you yes government digit so really all
 
01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
we should be debating right now is this
 
01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
underlying amount that is true thank you
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
that is true appreciate it okay is the
 
01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
question clear uh ought to pass on the
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.669 align:start position:0%

this on the regular calendar
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
