e

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone the time being
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
10:05 we'll get going on our work
 
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
session for
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
today and I will open the work session
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
1203 representative
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
PL to me this is a no-brain a rot to
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
pass uh because we had testimony that uh
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
the from the gaming industry that they
 
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
don't mind that they did need the to
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
rent at one time but they don't anymore
 
00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
because the wages have gone up and so
 
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
this is would benefit Charities and they
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
well okay anybody else on hb23
 
00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:28.150 align:start position:0%
well okay anybody else on hb23
representative

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
Aly so the idea would be that we send
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
another bill to the Senate trying to get
 
00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 align:start position:0%
them to move on this I'm not sure
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
there's any opposition to the Senate the
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
idea is to remove the rents charge to
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
Charities and and that we got in
 
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 align:start position:0%
testimony from the don't mind the Comm
 
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
the the gaming industry that they don't
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
mind this so I don't know what the
 
00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
objection would be for I don't either
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
but we don't know why representative Sen
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang is sitting on the bill that
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
contains that so you're talking about
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
sb112 which we passed out of um the
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
house with an amendment and um and we'll
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
see several bills today that are pieces
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
of that uh Bill yes representative
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
shamberg uh yes representative PL on um
 
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
shamberg uh yes representative PL on um
line

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
17

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
17
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
I'll get it right here in a minute lines
 
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
18 and 19 says any service agreement
 
00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
entered into by the chable organization
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
shall be submitted with the chable
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
organization's license application for
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
review by The Lottery Commission does
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
that mean all new or is that all present
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
ones will also be resubmitted I
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
I I'm not expert but I believe all of
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
them would have to be submitted because
 
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's a new every time you get a week or
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
anybody else any other thoughts comments
 
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.509 align:start position:0%
anybody else any other thoughts comments
representative

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
Ames it's really the same question that
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
representative Aly raised um this other
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
bill or bills I don't know even whether
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
there's another one floating around um
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
it' be really helpful to know what the
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
status of um
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
the other bill that contains the same
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
provision on rent is and that's just a
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
question if there's uh I'd like to have
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
an answer if I could get
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
one as far as we know at this point the
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
the they're sitting on that Bill yes
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative duet yes as I know it or
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
at least the information I have is the
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
senator Lang has another piece of
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that mimics what we passed
 
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
amended uh
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
sb112 um with a couple changes
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
um one can only smise as to why that
 
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
bill is being held over on that side and
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
like I said we're going to see other
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
components I myself filed other pieces
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
of legislation which we'll hear one of
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
them I think today um that were included
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
in that Amendment so um it's I guess
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
that Shaman's prerogative whether to
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
bring that up or not but I hear where
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
you're coming from we've already solved
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
this problem why are we handling it in
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
components at this point
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
right Mr chairman yes does shamber just
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
for the tech representative PL is a very
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable person but on lines 18 and
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
19 but does the Lottery
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
Commission could they give an
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
explanation will that be the case of
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
resubmitting all applications will come
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
back to the them if this is passed for
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
them to look
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
at well I see we have director McIntyre
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh good morning my name is Valerie King
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
I oversee the division that um does the
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
CH of gaming side of Lottery uh as far
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
as 18 and 19 about um us viewing the um
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
agreements we do that already so it
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
would just be a
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
continuation um but while I'm up here I
 
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that and this
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
is noted in the fiscal note that when
 
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.590 align:start position:0%
is noted in the fiscal note that when
they

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
um re worded the section they eliminated
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
the 35% goes to
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
Charities so that language should be put
 
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.629 align:start position:0%
Charities so that language should be put
back

00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
in it it doesn't say it anywhere else in
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:04.519 align:start position:0%
here okay thank you yes representative
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
Alman thank you uh well you're there uh
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal note on this one but
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
um can you tell us since they um
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
repealed and
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
reenacted I hate these uh could you tell
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
us what has changed in
 
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
this yeah and I can give you my copy it
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
was a note on the uh LSR that I can give
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
you and basically when it repealed RSA
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh 287 DD colon9 Roman numeral
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
2A that is where it specified I think it
 
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
also mentioned rent but as part of that
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
same sentence it said that the Chari
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
shall receive 35% of all the proceeds
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
and so when they took out the rent they
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
accidentally took everything out could
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
you repeat that on the the ref I can
 
00:13:02.829 --> 00:13:02.839 align:start position:0%
give this to you if you'd like oh great
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
if we could get copies I I can give you
 
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.470 align:start position:0%
if we could get copies I I can give you
this

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
287d Dash I mean colon
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
19 Roman numeral 2 and then a in
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
parentheses that's where it originally
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
was located and when they um revised the
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
it hold on one second representative
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I I I had meant to bring that
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
up and I'm glad you did and I think uh
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
my my belief is that we need to hold
 
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and get an amendment to
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
correct this this mistake that was
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
unintentional it just happened and um
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm all for this bill um once we get
 
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.910 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm all for this bill um once we get
it

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
perfected okay represent PL Mr chair

you representative Aly yeah I just
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that's the only
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
thing that
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
changed well that's the important part
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
that changed that that's
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
missing repr sorry are there any other
 
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
little words here and there that might
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
make a difference there was nothing that
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
we identified other than the 35% was um
 
00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:37.639 align:start position:0%

existing language
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:03.389 align:start position:0%
 
great

00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%

HP

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
1255 relative to Historic
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
moratorium representative plat it's a
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
simple enough Bill uh this is
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan's bill I believe
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
it's just extending the moratorium for a
 
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
couple more years but is that a good
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
idea or a bad idea I took to
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
representative DEET is that a good idea
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
or a bad idea I don't know I think the
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
so but as far as I'm concerned i' I'd
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
vote an itl on this yeah we have this
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
Mor um we have the moratorium in in the
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
amendment on S sp12 but we also
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
have I believe there's another bill
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
coming up not sure which number right
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
now but we're that's addressed as well
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
um yes represent fellows can somebody
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
please update me like if we do nothing
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
what is is there a moratorium and what
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
date I believe if we do nothing the
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
year we do nothing it's
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
microphone microphone please sorry I
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
thought I did it um if we do nothing
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
or if nothing is done to change the
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
existing law then the existing
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
law um that currently contains
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions on who can run this kind of
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
Casino um will continue without those
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions that's my understanding is
 
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
that right it's it's specific to HHR not
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
the yeah specific HHR and to uh to the
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
ability to open or not a new
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
casino but it's
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
say we're trying to do we're trying to
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
do something as I understand it to
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
limitation yes we have this in another
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
um I think it is it
 
00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:40.549 align:start position:0%
um I think it is it
hb15

00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
25 okay any other thoughts comments
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
1255 all right seeing none close the um
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.230 align:start position:0%
 
1255

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
1255
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
1389 this bill would allow the winner of
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
anonymous representative PL I heard from
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission they can already
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
R do that but but this would make it
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
clear in the statute that they could
 
00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919 align:start position:0%
unless they give affirmative Ascent that
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
Anonymous I think we will be good to
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
McIntyre uh good morning Mr chairman
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh I'm Charlie
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
McIntyre Lottery director um one of the
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
things I should point out at first is
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
the way this is drafted it actually is
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
impacting the tri-state Lotto
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
compact so it act I don't know if you
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
can change it because it's an agreement
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
between three states s the exact
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
language and this exact language was
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
negotiated by the three states in
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
1985 and the only person still remaining
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
from that period of time is the first
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
governor sonunu who signed the bill um
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so when you make changes to the
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
Commission in this bill you're changing
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
the Tri-State commission as to what they
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
can and cannot do and so you couldn't
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
change if a winner in New Hampshire won
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
in Vermont you can't change Vermont law
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
obviously it's U jurisdictional and you
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
know and so the Lottery Commission for
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is RSA
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
284 which gave the Lottery Commission
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
541a Authority Under rulemaking and our
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
prize claiming is based on rulemaking
 
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:52.039 align:start position:0%
through jail
 
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
car representative
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you um we had a discussion of
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
this and and there were other things
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
that on Charlie mentioned that earlier
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
that uh are difficult uh in just doing
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
this in blanket form they seem to hold
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh lotteries in public with with people
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
and everybody sees who won it um which
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
you'd have to stop doing I didn't know
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
about those yeah um but um what we
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was hold it and form a
 
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.070 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was hold it and form a
study

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
committee which is something we haven't
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
um been using but just get a few people
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
together with Charlie and Valerie
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
and if Valerie I guess Valerie isn't
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
involved in this but um to work out a
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
bill it does does this but doesn't
 
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
destroy things that are already going on
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
that have nothing to do with an
 
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
amenity and also I was thinking if we
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
ought to look at the
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
rules if the rules don't say on when
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
somebody comes to collect their money
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
you can tell them you can be anonymous
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
or not and I think we have to put that
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
in law if I could speak to that um M yes
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
so there's a difference between
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
publicity and so we list all the winners
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
who wi over $600 on our website on a tab
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
that's not particularly well looked at
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
very infrequently but we actually ask
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
the winners if over $600 to sign a media
 
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
form if indeed we're going to use their
 
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
information or likeness on our social
 
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
media and they sign it that they agreed
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
to do it and they fill out their name
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
and address and even who's in the
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
photograph with them and so it's I
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
looked at this and did some research
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
with our trade Association we're in the
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
middle ground of keeping folks Anonymous
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
there are some states where it is
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely forbidden you have to give
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
your name it's public regardless and
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
then there are some states that
 
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely keep it secret like Montana
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
you they can be anonymous forever uh and
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
we're in the Middle where it's if you
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to like we're not going to
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
publicize your name unless we ask you
 
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
too we actually had a firefighter to win
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
a big prize last two weeks ago would
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
have been a great story he didn't sign
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
we don't talk about it
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and then there's some states that
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
have a dollar value you know 10 over
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
10,000 you could be anonymous quar
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
million you could be anonymous half a
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
million 10 million um but if you go on
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work it would be a lot of
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
work to publicize all of our winners
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
there are almost you know thousand a
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
month so um that's just information for
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
the committee's
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
consideration represent PL given that I
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't opposed to the idea of a study
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
committee but given what director
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
McIntyre just said do we need this bill
 
00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
at all or any
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
Bill like it right now is is are there
 
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
rules that govern that anamin no it's
 
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
actually just we do do it out of
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
courtesy candidly for our player base
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
nobody nobody wants to service our
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
players more than I do candidly and so
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
if somebody doesn't want to be on
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
publicity for whatever reason we won't
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
we just won't um other abs of them
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
signing a document saying sure I'll be
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
publicity and it's not you I can hand
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
the form out if you want it's not like
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
it's fine print it's very much like hey
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
I agree to do this um
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
so you know it's obviously your choice
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
but it's we require some work because
 
00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
we'd have to change jail car rules as
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
well um and we'd have to rewrite this
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
bill into 284 as to where it fits
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
because there's not really any language
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
of 284 as to prize claiming that's not
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
done by rule as part of our relationship
 
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
with our
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
players so one of the one of the reasons
 
00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
you're using this form instead of
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
um uh putting it in rules we the rules
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
could then be in in um not violation but
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
in in conflict with the Tri-State
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
Lottery correct correct and there is no
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
conflict with our other associations but
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
that one certainly that one's codified
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
in law I don't know why it was done that
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
way the tri state is very unique in the
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
sense of it was the first multi-state
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
agreement that ever existed for
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
purposes representative ORS thank you Mr
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question so
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
in the coup's case we talked about last
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
time Charlie Temple was involved yes did
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
they sign that document no no very much
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
No in fact so we have a
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
rule I need to check to see that you're
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
an eligible person to play so that like
 
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
me for example or my wife can't play so
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
we say we check to make sure you're not
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
an eligible list also that you don't
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
have an asset for child support so I was
 
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
ordered by judge Temple specifically to
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
check to make sure that person was not
 
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
ineligible but um I only kept their
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
identity secret so only myself and one
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
other person knew their identity and so
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
fellows so there's a difference between
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
publicizing somebody's name in and
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
keeping it
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
private so right now you don't publicize
 
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
anybody's name unless they agree well
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
there's a list on our website that's
 
00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:40.039 align:start position:0%
kept under winners list every month
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
right right and I will I would ask the
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
question almost in from my seat is has
 
00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:47.559 align:start position:0%
this been a problem for anybody of the
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
folks you represent most of the vast
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the winners that walk
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
into my office win a th000 2,000 5,000
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
that's not you know difficulty money
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's you know you're buying around
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
that night for everybody but you're not
 
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
you know being hounded for car loans and
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
stuff and
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
so I've personally not heard of an issue
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
other than the big Winners that would
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
have an issue and candidly almost to a
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
person they've come in with legal
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
representation and candidly I will give
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
that advice always when they walk in go
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
find a lawyer just do it right because
 
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to want not just a lawyer
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to want an accountant for
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
tax purposes as well so
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
um the fact that we allow trusts and we
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
do has quelled what I would suggest is a
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
problem for the folks who would have
 
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
trouble with you know
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
people so follow up yeah sorry so I'm
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out let's forget about
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
the small amounts yeah we talk we're 10
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
I could might what if I win 10 million
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
Tri-State meab buuck and at the same
 
00:27:58.029 --> 00:27:58.039 align:start position:0%
time I or a different day I
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
earn I win 10 million in Powerball
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
because megabuck you told me the rules
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
are different yes so can somebody under
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
right to know or something or other even
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't and I don't want it
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
publicized can somebody find out if you
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
claim in your own name the answer is yes
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
correct if you claim in your own name
 
00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
the answer would be yes somebody would
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
find out how and how did they find out
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
well they would it would be on our site
 
00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:29.519 align:start position:0%
under the list of winners and then they
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
would be subject to 91a uh record
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
requests abing you going to court and
 
00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
getting a court order because you filed
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
it in your own
 
00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
name just one more question so so you
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
told us there some states said just
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
nothing is it wouldn't it how could we
 
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
make it be not public if it's over a
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
certain amount um and and they sign
 
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.549 align:start position:0%
certain amount um and and they sign
their

00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.389 --> 00:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
name we'd have to rewrite right RSA 284
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
and then obviously I'd have to I don't
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
know the process when a law trumps a
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
jail car rule uh how that
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
works I'm on jail car okay yeah jail car
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
has to conform to to what the statute is
 
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
statute comes first of and if the
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
statute were to change to be
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the rules the rules
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
would have to be
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
changed I know mean it's never
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
experienced it it's never happened
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
before for
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
us did Lottery have a position on this
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
bill yeah we're opposed to it we're
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
actually if you're looking at the
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
Spectrum we're in the middle ground
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
folks who win enough money can figure
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
out a way
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
to claim anonymously and candidly the
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
players will often on social media kind
 
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
of support the decision to claim an a
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
trust um for lots of reasons there's
 
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:53.799 align:start position:0%
also tax benefits as well um I I imagine
 
00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
I didn't study tax law um but it's
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
it makes it hard for us like for example
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is written 14o font
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
that they're it's Anonymous unless we
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
get them to ass sign essentially like a
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
mortgage payment
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
um it makes our job harder and like as
 
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
representative Aly suggested when I said
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
before we DT a number of drawings
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
publicly we give away a bunch of money
 
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't be able to do any of
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
those either and they're they're very
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
popular and very noteworthy every time
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
we do it the track it's almost always on
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
M that night and and press everywhere so
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative ORS would
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
you believe I find this bill I we should
 
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.870 align:start position:0%
you believe I find this bill I we should
itl

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
this representative PL I could agree
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
with representative ORS but I do like
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
the idea of interim studying it so that
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
we could uh put put a committee together
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
and see if we can't come up with
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
something acceptable to the Lottery
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
purpose well it wouldn't be stud uh
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
representative do just just a real quick
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
question for the director on
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
average annually prices above say $5
 
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
million annually you know you're talking
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
one or two yeah it's really it's a low
 
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
number I mean we we have been fortunate
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
in the last six years we've had three
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
winners over 100 million which is we
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
were just named well not just about six
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
months ago the luckiest state in the
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
country um that's so statistically
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
anomalous I can't even describe it but
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's representative
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
roir thank you and U so just looking at
 
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:41.909 align:start position:0%
roir thank you and U so just looking at
the

00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
law and and and I i' I've heard what you
 
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
said I've read the law the current law
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
not not what's being proposed here
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
and so tell me if I'm misunderstanding
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
this the what the law says is I'm going
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
to read it because I may I'm not an
 
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
attorney but um says the financial tax
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
trust or personal records filed received
 
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
maintained or produced by the Commission
 
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
in connection with payment of a prize as
 
00:32:14.669 --> 00:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
provided in this section shall be
 
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
confidential period then it goes on to
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
say something which I think I I think
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
the uh my colleague across the way asked
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
this but it does say such record shall
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
not be deemed public records under
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
91a so they would be confidential then
 
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
correct if I'm understanding 91a so you
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
you're citing
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
287 287 F10 yes so that like I said
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's the Tri-State compact so that
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
only applies to
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
trate it doesn't apply so when it says
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
commission there it means the Tri-State
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
commission not the New Hampshire Lottery
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
Commission and
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
if I understand the 1985
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
logic financing statements referred back
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
then to how we paid for the prize
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
payments going
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
forward so if I may so the commission
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
Tri State commission 1985 that I'm
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
assuming that had to do with Tri-State
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
megabuck that came about that time so
 
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
this doesn't even apply to Powerball
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
Mega Millions 98% of what we sell so
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
this is I I would agree with interim
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
study I mean this this is not this is
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
not what the co-sponsors wanteded I I I
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
believe even so no and we weren't
 
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:30.519 align:start position:0%
consulted on it so I certainly wouldn't
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
have drafted it 287 yeah I think it's I
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's ready I I I couldn't
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
go along with
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
this okay I just want to make sure
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
people understand difference between
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
interim study and a and creating a study
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm not so which what do you stand on
 
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
that uh you know if the if the if the
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee feels like
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
this is a pressing issue U to move
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
forward which i i i i as as somebody who
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
thinks values privacy I think a study
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
commiss committee uh would be
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate moving forward with with
 
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.589 align:start position:0%
appropriate moving forward with with
this

00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
ENT if it's the purview of this the the
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
the committee I could go either way I
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
guess is what I'm saying you know
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
anything but
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
OTP if we form a committee does that
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
have to be enacted in law or could be an
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
informal committee yeah so just an
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
informal committee so I interim study
 
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
this form an informal committee work
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
with director McIntyre to come up with
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
something acceptable for next
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
term representative Aly so I just I want
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
just make oh I'm sorry I yeah represent
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
Aly had her hand up first did you have a
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
no I I just wanted to point out that we
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
could have a uh subcommittee on this
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
which is the term for it and then uh and
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
then if they can't come to a conclusion
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
in time for getting the bill in it's
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
study that's a possibility it it it
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
could be a tall order to get that uh in
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
line in time but uh representative
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
Ames um I guess I'm jumping the
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
line uh representative fellows
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
so the words that you read to us about
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
the um Tri-State
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
compact can we just use those same words
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
to apply
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
to everything over 5 million or two
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
million or something like that I'd
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
really want to look at it in terms of
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
crafting it deliberately I don't I don't
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
like sort of doing this on the shooting
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
from the hip on okay lot legal changes
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
but but right now if you win Tri-State
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
megabuck then your name automatically is
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
is you you'd have to ask to make your
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
correct represent
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
um I think it's it's clear that this
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
bill is not an a ought to pass bill and
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
in it could be an ideal but uh in terms
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
of studying it and trying to figure out
 
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
maybe there is something here um and
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the expression goes just a a a
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh solution looking for a problem um uh
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
and I I think there's something genuine
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
um lurking behind this about privacy and
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and at least being
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
definitively assured that it uh is okay
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
the way we are now and I have no doubt
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
about it that you're
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
balancing all these interests and making
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
it come out in a good way um and I sort
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
of lean towards itl for that reason but
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
if we're going to study it I think you
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
alluded to the difficulties if uh if we
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
do a study committee within the existing
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
frame before the deadline for reporting
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
this bill out it's really going to be
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
hard to do anything
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
meaningful um and uh if we do interim
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
study this is uh an election here and um
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
I think there's room for interim studies
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
on important issues I don't know whether
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
realistically I mean other people can
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
judge this I'm perfectly willing to
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
participate in an interim study on on
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
this particular issue but it does line
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
up besides a whole host of other um uh
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
pressures that each of us have on our
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
time and uh so I'm not sure what I I'm
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
recommending I'm thinking out loud I
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
guess as I say these
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
things yes thank you for those thoughts
 
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
I think um I mean the other way this can
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
go is if it goes itl um it certainly
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
does not stop those who are passionate
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
about this area to work on it and come
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
year did you have some no I just say
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
next year I was just saying but yeah
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
given what you just said I guess I could
 
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
go with itl cuz any study might be the
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
same result uh but come up with a bill
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
for next
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
year anybody
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
else okay thank you um we'll close the
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
1389 I'll now open the work session on
 
00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.630 align:start position:0%

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I do we have a draft Amendment
 
00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:17.079 align:start position:0%
because you said that it had an error in
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
it that was the other
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
one sorry there's a drafting error in
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%

me and I think somebody just said that
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
this is the one that we could put our
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
change on line four approved to approved
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%

the Lottery Commission just English
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's all oh we're missing the word to
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right yes I don't want to this
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
slip away I just want to make sure we
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
get the right Amendment um so
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
um so on line four we'd uh we'd uh add
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
in the pending applications I understand
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
that um I was just looking down
 
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
that um I was just looking down
further

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
um where at uh we have the language a
 
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
game operator employer holding a license
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
prior to October
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
18 2023 shall be eligible Etc is that to
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
need to have the application I I think
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's line8 also no that's uh
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay figure out get the
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
appli can't hear so um representative
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
Ames you're saying the word to was
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
missing uh on line 10 is that no line 10
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
is shall be
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
eligible it's back at the very beginning
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:38.150 align:start position:0%
of the
line

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh but the license refers to holding a
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
license let's see a game operator the
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
sentence that begins on line nine game
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
operator employer holding a
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
license prior to October 18 shall be
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
eligible for license sh to sell and and
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
um maybe maybe that's our r stand I I
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't know whether we need to have have
 
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.750 align:start position:0%
don't know whether we need to have have
your

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.630 align:start position:0%
your
microphone

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
sorry all right representative duet do
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
you see a issue with that
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
wording from line The End of Line nine
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
through line 10 I I think it probably
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
would would cover if we inserted uh
 
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
holding Andor applied for something to
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
that effect okay
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is that uh
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative duet take it away to the
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
drafting attorney and make sure that uh
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
included in the group that can go
 
00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:40.559 align:start position:0%
forward with uh these this type of games
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
are the applicants that we're talking
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
about uh in the first line at line
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
four that when somehow somehow in the
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
rest of the language we haven't dropped
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
them that's
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
all yeah okay rosent PL okay this is a
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
permanent moratorium is
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
that is a permanent moratorium permanent
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
or was something we could visit two or
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
three years because I'm not sure well
 
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh represent PL it's the same thing
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
that applies all the time one
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
legislature cannot hold the next
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
legislature uh to something so next year
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
it could be changed I'd like to speak to
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
that too if I
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
represent exactly right about the
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
legislature having the last word at any
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
point in time um we're trying to get
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
this moratorium straightened out before
 
00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.630 align:start position:0%
this moratorium straightened out before
the

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
statute um that that uh sets
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
limits um expires we're trying to get a
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
get a bill through and adopted by the
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
legislature that's more or less right um
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
as best we can determine before that
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
time July 1 I think of this year
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
um in the meantime a commission that
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
representative Jed and I I think
 
00:45:01.839 --> 00:45:03.030 align:start position:0%
representative Jed and I I think
representative

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
Jan uh sit on um is working on the
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
larger question a larger set of
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
questions related to gaming that
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
um in a general sense include this this
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
issue it may well be that out of that
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
event comes out of that work comes a a
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
Solution that's different from what
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking right now this just gets
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
us into a a a position that's acceptable
 
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
going forward in until something else
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
comes along just and and that again
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
endorses your point that the legislature
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
in the end can move in a different
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
you any other comments question
 
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
representative PL so what I'm hearing is
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended when we get the
 
00:45:56.319 --> 00:45:59.430 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended when we get the
amended

00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
one all right close the work session on
 
00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:45.950 align:start position:0%
one all right close the work session on
HB

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
1525 I'll now open the work session on
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
HB 1549 relative to buying amount
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
deductions collected during the
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
operation of games of chance repres PL
 
00:47:59.069 --> 00:47:59.079 align:start position:0%
I'm all right with to pass on this one
 
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
we heard eloquent testimony from
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative duet that uh it's it it
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
limit cap cap the amount to $250 because
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
people won't pay more than
 
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
that it would it would just the
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
that I have a represent names a question
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:31.109 align:start position:0%
 
lottery

00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
so the um the language that we have in
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
front of
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
us uh provides
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.150 align:start position:0%
for the
amount

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's collected from the
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
players uh the buyin amount collected
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
players um that there shall be deducted
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
from that 35%
 
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
% 30% of that total amount uh is to be
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
paid to the charity
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
charity and the balance retained by the
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
game operator employer my question is
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
tax so the state tax is not not taken in
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
the same way it's taken out before okay
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
this division so it won't affect the
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
state revenue
 
00:49:27.079 --> 00:49:28.390 align:start position:0%
state revenue
representative

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
fellows so I I forgot to bring my copy
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill but I remember it so if we
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
cut back that
 
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.470 align:start position:0%
cut back that
amount

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
um who Lo where where who loses or wins
 
00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:49:48.359 --> 00:49:50.030 align:start position:0%
in that
situation

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
um ideally no one loses it would be
 
00:49:59.309 --> 00:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
activity if you're taking so I know this
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
is going to sound odd but the less the
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
house takes usually the more the house
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
sense not my question
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
sorry so what what we're talk so which
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
money so so based on the pot the Buy in
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
fee is a certain amount of money the Buy
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
in fee is a certain amount of money
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
which is now
 
00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.589 align:start position:0%
which is now
split

00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
split
 
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
changing so it's it's a little bit
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
different than before it used to be that
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
80% the whole pot you took 80% goes back
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
in prizes and 20% is split now it's sort
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the same thing except that that
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
that 20% is
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
capped and it's not expected to create a
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
huge loss it it's not really going to
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
impact it that much it will be a slight
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
impact but we're not expecting a big
 
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
impact from that slight
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
Readjustment if I could it's only in
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
play in very large games which of which
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
there are not
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
many I I can't think of one actually and
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I can't think of one where this
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
would apply currently so it's not a loss
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
it's trying to make it so that you could
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
have a larger game where the payout to
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
the players was higher or the takeout
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
from the house was less how we want to
 
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
look at it and I think representative
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
said I could probably explain it better
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
than I could representative said well I
 
00:51:41.119 --> 00:51:41.750 align:start position:0%
than I could representative said well I
I

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
think and your concern I share it does
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
not change what the the state revenue
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
and the most importantly the Charities
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
get for Revenue it doesn't change that
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
35% hot stop what it does is that the
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
the monies that are collected for that
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
purpose are capped at 20% as it is now
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
if there's a larger game or a
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
a uh a room wants to run a super duper
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
super bowl of
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
fker it would cap that rake that return
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
that revenue for the Charities at L at
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
$250 so it doesn't change the 35% and I
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
think that's where you're getting to
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative maybe I'm incorrect but
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
it does not change what what the uh the
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
revenue is for the Charities or the
 
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
state at the end of the
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
day let me just ask a question first
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't there something here where if the
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
number got too large it discouraged
 
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:47.799 align:start position:0%
larger players well exactly and and like
 
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
the director
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
said there's no history here nobody's
 
00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
run a big buyin tournament like that
 
00:52:56.349 --> 00:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
they do do it at some of the bigger
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
casinos in
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
Vegas Etc this was both from The
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
Operators and poker players that asked
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
for this because they saw this as you
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
know I'm not going to pay $500 for a
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
$2,500 buying if somebody chose to run
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
that I don't think we're going to have a
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
big flood of these huge tournaments it
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
just kind of gives them some God rails
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
and and it sounds like it's potentially
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
been an impediment we're not going to
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
see a huge inflow but it's it's
 
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
potentially been an impediment that gets
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
fellows I thought oh let's
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
suppose with this bill and with the way
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
it is now versus this bill and you had
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
exactly the same number of
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
different I'm I'm wondering if I might
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
what do you mean the exact same number
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
of players and what the director is
 
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
saying too is you you'll get a 100
 
00:54:04.349 --> 00:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
players I just want to understand the
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
math so if you had the same number of
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
players with current statute versus this
 
00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
one what
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
changes nothing unless that game
 
00:54:21.789 --> 00:54:21.799 align:start position:0%
is above what what would be 1250
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
anything above
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
1250 would
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
if if the buying was 1250 meaning the
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
the Take Back The Rake was
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
20% 20% of 1250 is 250 yeah okay so you
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
would Max at a a tournament that the
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
buyin would be 12
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
$1250 250 of that so 1,000 would go to
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
the player pool 250 would go wouldn't
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
change the math at all if the buying
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
is500 we're talking another 20% on top
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
250 so basically to use that example he
 
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
just said if it was if the buying was
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
1500 then the um
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
then instead of 250 it would go to 300
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
and the problem as we heard in the
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
public session is
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
um you're less likely to get you know
 
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
these players are going to go other
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
places where the the because 20% is high
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
as the numbers get bigger
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
your Oka players are a strange
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
breed and will not come out for that
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
they just won't it it gives them this
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity like I
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
said I don't think I'm speaking wrong
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
when I say this doesn't change how much
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
money the Charities are getting this
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
quite frankly gives them an opportunity
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
to make more money because we'll have if
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
if there's a a premium tournament
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
there'll be more players that come in
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
benefit from that and the peripheral
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
play etc
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.829 align:start position:0%
play etc
etc

00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative Le please
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay I used to be in sales part of my
 
00:56:34.029 --> 00:56:34.039 align:start position:0%
career so I like to repeat what I heard
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand it right now
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're giving up nothing and there's a
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
potential to make more money as a result
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
of this cap and I'm also hearing ought
 
00:56:42.079 --> 00:56:45.150 align:start position:0%
of this cap and I'm also hearing ought
to

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
pass Sly put yes representative
 
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
leapley we're not giving up nothing it's
 
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
math right like you're say saying that
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
if we go above this number we no longer
 
00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.069 align:start position:0%
if we go above this number we no longer
collect

00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
collect
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
20% it's capped at 250 so we're giving
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
up you know if we do run a bigger game
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
we're not getting 20% well tech tech
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
point is we're not running a bigger game
 
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
my question is why would we want to like
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
why do we allow gambling in the
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
state well technically what you said is
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
correct the reason we are giving
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
something up is because nobody is
 
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
willing to play those higher numbers
 
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
because as soon as you get into numbers
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
like that they'll go to Massachusetts or
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere else to play that so you're
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the advantage is to
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
have to run a bigger game when we're
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
right well you potentially so those
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
players may not even be coming to play
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
they may be going to other states so you
 
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
are potentially getting players that
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have even played so that's why
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
you're getting
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
more representative fellows yes so I
 
00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
would like to say that we only raised
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
that cap last year and so I don't know
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
what the effective date is it might have
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
been July 1 but it you know might have
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
been a little bit later than that so we
 
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
don't really know if they're going to
 
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
how many people we're keeping away from
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
playing because we haven't even been
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
through a whole year yet you know I
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe they don't like to
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
gamble as much in the winter there sow
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
scares them away but we don't I hear the
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
I hear the sales pitch about
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know you get you're going to get
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
more money if if you lower essentially
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
it's marketing you're going to get more
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
money if you lower the price you're
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
going to get more customers if you lower
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
the price that may be true but it may
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
not be true also we really don't have
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
any data that proves it one way or the
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
1549 okay I'm going to open the work
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
15 providing that a two-thirds vote is
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
required to pass legislation imposing
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
taxes all right we're we're done with
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
that last one
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative PL I have difficulty
 
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
with two3 even to apply to fees and I
 
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
know some states have passed this and
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury is not here at
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
the moment but he asked a question
 
00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing would 60% be
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
acceptable I just want to float that out
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
and see if there's appetite for
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.109 --> 00:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
two3 a question for represent restive
 
00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
PL representative are are you saying you
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
want to change the number downward to 1
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
half it is 1 half now
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
well are you saying you want to go lower
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
he did not say that okay I just want to
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
make sure I hear it I think all he's
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
asking is is an appetite for something
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
else but um we'll decide
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
representative okay represent
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
elme just briefly aside from the damage
 
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
that it would do to the state at some
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
future time uh the damage it would do to
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
our bond rating is
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
considerable when a state does not have
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
enough resources to um pay back for
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
essential kinds of services the bond
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
rating starts to thinking about when are
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
we going to
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
stop paying on our for our
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
bond Bond
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
payments and particularly of course when
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
you're putting in everything to do with
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
State bonds but
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
um the other it applies more generally
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
to the ability of the state to
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.230 align:start position:0%
 
services

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
representa elberger thank you Mr
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um when representative Osborne
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
was here to introduce the bill last week
 
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things he said was that we
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
have low taxes due to good money
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
management now
 
01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:49.039 align:start position:0%
I would like to believe that I manage my
 
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
money well and sometimes that means
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
having enough money to well often it
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
means having having enough money to pay
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
my bills and just deciding that I don't
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
want to have as much money because
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
whatever reason I can't find an analogy
 
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.750 align:start position:0%
whatever reason I can't find an analogy
to

01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
taxes if we don't have enough money to
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
pay our bills and we don't have enough
 
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
money to pay for likely future
 
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.990 align:start position:0%
money to pay for likely future
bills

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
than not than deciding that any ways to
 
01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.069 align:start position:0%
than not than deciding that any ways to
increase

01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
revenues is a bad money management
 
01:02:30.269 --> 01:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
practice in my mind um we are likely to
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
have increasing education
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities from two lawsuits that
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
are coming up
 
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
and making sure that we can't fund them
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
is not good money management in my mind
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh when I asked representative Osborne
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
if lowering taxes or fees or not
 
01:02:59.950 --> 01:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
allowing new taxes or fees requiring a
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
the same 2/3 majority he said no he said
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
in fact that maybe we would only need
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
onethird to pass uh lowering taxes or
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
fees um I find this particularly
 
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.710 align:start position:0%
fees um I find this particularly
disturbing

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
disturbing
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
um the outcome will absolutely be
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
increasing property taxes for
 
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
our citizens for our
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
constituents uh and that's to me that's
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
about the worst way we can go about
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
looking at increasing taxes I want to
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
just mention one anecdote and this is a
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
totally non-representative survey uh my
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
husband and I really enjoy going out to
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
eat at diners we're big Diner people we
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
went to a diner in Hudson the other day
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh Suzies we love Suzies uh
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
and I asked the
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
waitress you know if this restaurant fee
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
restaurant tax were to be lowered how
 
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
would you feel about that she said
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
that's great you know I can always every
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
little bit helps I said if you knew that
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
as a result of lowering this tax your
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
property taxes would have to be raised
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
to cover the loss of revenue from
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
something like that how would you feel
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
she said I'll pay the extra 20 cents on
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
my restaurant bill
 
01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
I think we have constituents who are
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
smart enough to understand
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
that when you Tak an action it has not
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
just the expected consequence but the
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
secondary consequence that we need to
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
follow what I think of is the A to B to
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
C rule a lot of people go from A to B
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't think about what happens
 
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
from B to C well B Toc is not a good
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
idea and I cannot in any conscience vote
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
to support
 
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
this okay representative
 
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
llee thank you Mr chair um along the
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
lines of like following logic to its
 
01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
conclusion um representative Osborne
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
spoke on on behalf of the EFA vouchers
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
that passed on Thursday and that
 
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
spending is not held to a 2/3 approval
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
rate so we
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
just approved spending I think it's over
 
01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.470 align:start position:0%
just approved spending I think it's over
$45

01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
$45
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
million um
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
more not in a budget Year and that was
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
not held to a 2third approval rate so it
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense that when you're
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
budgeting you would hold raising money
 
01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.870 align:start position:0%
budgeting you would hold raising money
to

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
this high standard and not spending
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
money so we can continue to increase how
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
much we're spending and make it harder
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
for us to raise funds to balance the
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
budget so to me this is a this is an itl
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
as well thank
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
you well the example you just gave um I
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
would think or not think but operates
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
within the current law if the current
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
law changed to 2/3 then that 2/3 would
 
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
have been subject to it a bill that
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
requires spending money if I understand
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
saying so if I'm this
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
bill it's on increasing
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
taxes right 2/3 is required to increase
 
01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
taxes but 2/3 is not required to
 
01:06:39.279 --> 01:06:42.069 align:start position:0%
taxes but 2/3 is not required to
increase

01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
spending that's not addressed in the
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill you're saying so that's my concern
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
is that it's just as easy to spend money
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
which we just spent a bunch of money on
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
Thursday not in a like I don't know
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
where that money is going to come from
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
we did our budget last year so it seems
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
to me that that's introducing more
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
imbalance into the system to make it
 
01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
harder to raise money but it's not
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
making it harder to spend it so we could
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
continue to up you know education
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
vouchers for example but not be able to
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
fund that because we can't get 2third so
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's just an analogy like what would
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
that look like next
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
time represent
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.870 align:start position:0%
time represent
umy

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
umy
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
chair having put forward a bill like
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
this before and heard the argument that
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
if you're going to um restrict raising
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
taxes we should restrict spending we
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
already restrict spending based upon the
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue the state has because
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
we have a balanced budget requirement in
 
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
we have a balanced budget requirement in
our

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
a valid argument in my opinion because
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
it already exists the one is directly
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
related to the other based upon the
 
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue that comes
 
01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.349 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue that comes
forward

01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
so if we're talking about
 
01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
increasing taxes on our neighbor we
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
should that indicates that we weren't
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
watching how how we were spending our
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
programs is a non sequitor in my
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you Mr
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
chair represent
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
elme thank you on we have a balance
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
balanced budget it is only balanced
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
until people come and put in new
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
spending which we did last week uh and
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
then sometimes in in harder times uh
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
when I came into the
 
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
legislature we had mostly had Republican
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
Governors they'd made a habit out of
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
spending more than we were getting in
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
and revenue and leaving the deficit to
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
Governor uh that finally ended when we
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
got Democratic governors in and people
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as uh interested in doing
 
01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
that and I don't think at this point on
 
01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
the present Governor has done that
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
partly because we have huge amounts of
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
Stir of money coming in from from the
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
Feds that is now
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
ending um
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
this also talks about license fees and
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take us through a little
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
history of that uh when I became chair
 
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
of ways and means for the first time we
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
had a lot of bills put in by um uh
 
01:10:12.159 --> 01:10:13.950 align:start position:0%
had a lot of bills put in by um uh
professional

01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
professional
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
associations and
 
01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
um the snowboard the
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles associations in particular
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
stuck with me uh uh a lot of different
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
associations that had a license fee
 
01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
which had not been changed in 2025
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
years and during that time as now there
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
had been
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
inflation and they weren't getting the
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
services that they expected from that
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
license fee anymore because there wasn't
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
enough money in the license fee we
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
raised I think
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
253 um
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
fees that
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
year and the next year uh from people
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
who came before us and said we need this
 
01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.229 align:start position:0%
who came before us and said we need this
done

01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
because we want to make sure that the
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
the um the snowmobile paths get properly
 
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh dusted um leveled and uh we need this
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
done because we're way behind in
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
licensing these people um because we've
 
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
only got one person doing it because we
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
can't afford any more than that U
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
and snowmobilers stick with me because
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
afterwards they went to their members
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
and said they raised our
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
fees as as if it was a bad idea but they
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
were the ones who' asked for it on the
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
next term when uh the O'Brien
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
legislature was in place um they put in
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
two two people put in almost identical
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
bills that that uh undid everything we'd
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
done including cutting a couple of
 
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
things that were NE didn't need them um
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
and we had a six-hour he
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
hearing about those and we had a
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
six-hour hearing because uh we asked the
 
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
people who'd asked for the money to come
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
in and explain to us why they needed the
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
money and they then quietly shelved the
 
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
bills which in the Brian time was quite
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
something so um that's a kind of a
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
microcosm of what's happening when we're
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
we're cutting taxes that are less easily
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
identifiable as the service that we need
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
that has increased inflation has
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
increased cost
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
of and if
 
01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.149 align:start position:0%
of and if
we

01:13:13.149 --> 01:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
um we have been cutting quite a few
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
taxes in recent years on we have had
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
help from the federal government each
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
time that
 
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
disguised uh problems with
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
this and um we are at a juncture right
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
now where if we passed something like
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
66% of taxes being paid as property
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
taxes to considerably more than that and
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
then probably into destruction we're
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
already seeing destruction because there
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
are too
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
many um people who can't afford to live
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
away yes represent or thank you Mr chair
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
so I do agree with r bamy and we got to
 
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
be careful about taking any more
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
additional Cuts uh if I understand efas
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
correctly though we did not add to the
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
spending I thought the Money Follows the
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
student so if the money follow the
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
student the student goes to a public
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
charter school or a montau school or
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
whatever the money's just moving it's
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
like we're taking it here and we're
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
following in here so there's no increase
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
in the budget as far as or the spending
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's one point second point would
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
be uh yes representative Osborne did say
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
that uh I forget who asked the question
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
and uh that the the uh taking you know
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
reducing the taxes would only take a
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
third vote he was obviously being
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
factious uh I'd like everybody to recall
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
that cuz I came back and asked him I
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
said well you really meant or you really
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
would do 50% plus one and he said yes so
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
he wasn't he wasn't serious about that I
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
mean that's I thought pretty obvious so
 
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
I think we need to be careful how we do
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
this but you know I see the same thing
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
happening we we raise taxes and then we
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know red taxes and I would like to
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
see some stability there you know even
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
if it was an amendment where if we we do
 
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
something in the first year we're not
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
going to do it in the second year we're
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
going to just let it ride for a year and
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
then we revisit it you know when you're
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
when you're raising the rate and you're
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
lower the
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
rate it's hard to it's hard to get a
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
gauge on it uh the other thing that I
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
asked representative Osborne for if you
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
would recall is that I asked him to
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
provide proof of his theory of and we've
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
all heard it before Ronald Reagan called
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
the trickle down that was a term used I
 
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
think in the late 18th century also so
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
it wasn't new to rean but there is there
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
is a uh there is proof that sometimes
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
you reduce taxes you raise revenue and
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
and uh rep uh olry over here loves to
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
talk about the Laughing
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.430 align:start position:0%
talk about the Laughing
curve

01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
curve
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
and it is a little but there's there's
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
that sweet spot and and when we keep
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
jerking things around I think we should
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
be letting it ride
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
now uh
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative PL already announced this
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
morning to some of you that were here
 
01:16:45.149 --> 01:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
earlier that some of us already got
 
01:16:48.629 --> 01:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
called out uh Yours Truly here for
 
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
voting against my bill I co-sponsored to
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
not reduce the tax so I'm hearing what
 
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
you're saying but I mean we got to we
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
need to work together and balance this
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
thing out but you know we're we're not
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
pumping the we're not pumping up
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
spending by supporting efas thank you
 
01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
very much well I think to some of your
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
point there the
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
um evening out this thing because we do
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
see you know one one party gets in you
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
know and the other and taxes bounce
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
around I think the intent here by
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne was to even that
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
out and to smooth it out um and um you
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
know I'll just point out too if you look
 
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
at I don't want to diminish and I don't
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
the idea that there are times when you
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
know we have to be mindful of our income
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
and expenses and and getting Revenue in
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
however I would remind you look at a
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
state like California there's no limit
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
to how much they can keep raising taxes
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
and and the last thing I heard is
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
they're running a $ 48 billion deficit
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
so it's there's obviously it's a complex
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
interaction there's a lot of things
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
going on but sometimes I think you know
 
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
we we've got to be careful not to to
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
make it uh too simplistic representative
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
all you had your hand up before yeah
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative as yeah okay
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.669 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
next

01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:18:12.679 --> 01:18:15.750 align:start position:0%
next
thanks

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
um first uh the latest news from
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
California is $18 billion do instead of
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
48 so they're moving they're getting
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
better closer but $18 billion doar and
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
the context of New Hampshire sounds like
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know something that you can't
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
even think of I think that was
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
accounting trickery we talked about last
 
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
week yeah I don't know
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
um and then just a a comment on the EFA
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
discussion um I think we all know that
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
um many of the recipients of of uh funds
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
through that program um received them
 
01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
for kids that have never entered into
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
the public schools so there's uh um it's
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
a new cost and um that's recognized by
 
01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
the budget people I'm not saying
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
anything that's out of order I think
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's very clear um but I don't want to
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
dwell on that I think my my uh General
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
attitude towards this bill is that uh
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
for um a very very long time perhaps the
 
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
life of this this uh State as a
 
01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
state uh within a federal
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
system um the rule has been major a
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
majority rule um deciding uh budgets and
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
other matters of importance by majority
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
votes and um and when it comes to to
 
01:19:56.629 --> 01:19:56.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal matters we've managed to uh as a
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
as a a state and the community within
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
the state to uh find our way uh forward
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
and through the Maze of complicated uh
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
choices that have to be made just like
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
the household that was spoken of by
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative elberger is a complicated
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
choices but um we don't uh handicap one
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh approach over the other by a special
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
rule that would apply in this case to uh
 
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
to um new or increase taxes or license
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
fees um and I think we should stick with
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
majority rule and uh I could say a lot
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
of lot about how I I wish we uh uh made
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
different choices but I'm not going to
 
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
do that um I keep fighting for those
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
choices and I'm probably be uh um
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
discussing in a hopefully a polite way
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
different points of view with uh my
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
other colleagues in this room um but why
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
go to why go to this uh 2third vote
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
requirement um at this time we've had
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
had this system in place for a long time
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's honored by all the decision making
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's occurred over the years we don't
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
way

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I I'm looking past the mic
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.990 align:start position:0%
 
does

01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
no I did have my hand representative
 
01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
elme I've developed a couple of things
 
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
here one uh schools have
 
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
major on fixed
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
costs even if you are taking people
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
people out of the schools the schools
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
usually can cut very little unless
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
they're starting to cut things that the
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
community thinks are important like arts
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
and stuff so um what that happens then
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
is that it goes on the property
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
tax um second California is a referendum
 
01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
State and they got in serious trouble
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
because of that they were raising on
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
raising they frequently were not raising
 
01:22:37.229 --> 01:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
taxes or they were stopping stopping tax
 
01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
raises from going through at the same
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
time that they were voting for major new
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
benefits that cost a lot of
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
money and it was a crazy system I'm not
 
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
sure how it is that that they're getting
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
out of it uh third um the
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
Democrats we haven't been in that often
 
01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
but when we have been in the only times
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
that we've raised any taxes other than
 
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
the tobacco tax that I can remember and
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
the tobacco tax was done uh to try to
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
stop young people from from
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh on smoking and it seemed to be the
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
only thing that anyone could prove would
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
stop young people from smoking um but
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
aside from that we did raise the fees
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
when people came to us and said it's
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
been 2025 years of
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
inflation on we only raised the taxes
 
01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
when we got to the major
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
recessions and we seem to get the
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
recessions representative
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
Eary thank you Mr chair I thank uh the
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
representa from uh Handover
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
for just Lebanon close enough yeah
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
they're liberal up there you can't tell
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
one from the
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
other well one's to the left and one's
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
right let's uh let's keep our remarks
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
focused on the uh Hill at
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
hand the comments that representative
 
01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:20.550 align:start position:0%
hand the comments that representative
Aly

01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
made it to my mind
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
bill because when we look at the
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
increase in the tobacco
 
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
tax the increase in the uh Trail
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance fee registration
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
p uh various other tax increases that
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
have passed both this committee under
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
both norms and and Susan's leaders
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative majors and representative
 
01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.030 align:start position:0%
representative majors and representative
aly's

01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
aly's
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
leadership had passed by a substantial
 
01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.470 align:start position:0%
leadership had passed by a substantial
margin

01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
margin
 
01:25:02.109 --> 01:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
18-2 20 to
 
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
nothing that's better than the 2/3
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's 100% And when they get to the
 
01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:11.719 align:start position:0%
floor they passed by the 2/3 because
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
there was a justification for it there
 
01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
was an argument presentation and due
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
diligence and debate that took
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.910 align:start position:0%
diligence and debate that took
place

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
as was
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
outlined which is the way it should
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
be and as the comments were made
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
regarding California and a couple of
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
other states if you don't have those
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions then it becomes too
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
easy to wind up with massive spending
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
and massive
 
01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.189 align:start position:0%
and massive
taxes

01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that's something to be taken into
 
01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
so that's something to be taken into
consideration

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:55.550 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
you uh represent elberger thank you Mr
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
chairman may I ask representative UI a
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
this sure go right to it I don't have an
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
answer so I'm asking you um we do have a
 
01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
couple of lawsuits that may require
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
State funding a good deal more of public
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:23.709 align:start position:0%
State funding a good deal more of public
education

01:26:23.709 --> 01:26:23.719 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
let's assume that that happens just for
 
01:26:25.679 --> 01:26:28.229 align:start position:0%
let's assume that that happens just for
argument

01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
sake if we then have to fund a
 
01:26:31.679 --> 01:26:33.149 align:start position:0%
sake if we then have to fund a
significantly

01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
larger education bill or
 
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
bills and I don't mean this kind of Bill
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
I mean this kind of
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
Bill how would you
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
suggest we go about doing that when my
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
guess is that there would not be a two
 
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
funding if a court order takes
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
place the bill is going to be paid one
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
order so there's no this and if you read
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
it it it has an escape clause in
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
those in that uh requirement the same
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh argument could be said for uh bonds
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
that were
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
due it's the same exact
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
argument it's required to be paid it's
 
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
going to be paid
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
period how we pay it that's up to
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal and you know we take money from
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
Peter to pay Paul but eventually that's
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
done now my other question is what what
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
Californian what did you have at susies
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
I like the Californian we can we can
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
take that offline given that uh we're uh
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
the time is getting close to 11:30 yes
 
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellow I I would just
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
like to um ask where is this Escape
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
Clause that says we would have to raise
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
taxes or do whatever else is needed to
 
01:28:22.109 --> 01:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
pay for a court order I don't see it in
 
01:28:22.119 --> 01:28:24.629 align:start position:0%
pay for a court order I don't see it in
Miss

01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
Bill if I may yes on second page the
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
Escape calls I think representative ol
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
is talking about is lines four through S
 
01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
which means the treasurer is going to
 
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
take all the money that we would use for
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
operating in the state for paying our
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
services and everything it's going to
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
put it toward that court order which
 
01:28:51.149 --> 01:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
leaves us no money to do our pay for our
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
citizen service
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
so that I think is where he came from
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
right well and I think I think the the
 
01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
point that represent Osborne had made
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
was if you get to that point the
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
citizens are going to be very upset
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's going to be pressure on the
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
legislature to act uh yes represent
 
01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
fellows so I what I reading that is that
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
has to do with Bond payments doesn't
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
have to do with any court order for
 
01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
any anybody else anybody we haven't
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
heard from any new ideas thoughts
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none I'm going to
 
01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
close the um work session on c one thing
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's a real taxing discussion thank
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
you for that we'll close uh the work
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
15 I'm going to open the work session on
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
HB 1116 relative to eliminating the fee
 
01:29:58.750 --> 01:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
to file as a candidate for the office of
 
01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.790 align:start position:0%
to file as a candidate for the office of
state

01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative representative PL yeah
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
there's 400 of us this would be 800
 
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
bucks worth of lost Revenue but let's
 
01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
say there's two or three candidates for
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
each election so that instead of 800 it
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
becomes 1,600 or 2400 the idea this is
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
small potatoes we're get paid a 100
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
bucks a year can we save two bucks and
 
01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
the the most of that cost is eaten up by
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
it so your your fin I'm sorry your final
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion was what well that this this
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
is a that the money that's collected is
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
minimal $800 maybe up to $2,400 for the
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
entire State and the process of having
 
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
to collect it and keep track of it eats
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
up some of that oh I see okay
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Aly thank you um we
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
discussed this also and on I think I
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
think we confirmed that the fee is paid
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:30:59.310 --> 01:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
clerk and that this is all the clerk
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
gets for doing all that paperwork for us
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
so we didn't think we ought to do
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
this yes repres just to add quickly to
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
to that statement that if we were way in
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
if we were Municipal and County and not
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
ways and means we would probably be
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
looking at this and saying you know
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
maybe we should be raising the amount
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
not cutting it to zero because if you
 
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
cut it to zero then this makes it an
 
01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.950 align:start position:0%
cut it to zero then this makes it an
unfunded

01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
mandate represent
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
Ellery I don't know is if there's a
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
section in law that says that the town
 
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
clerk can't charge the $10 mandatory fee
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
oath because they could eliminate this
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
and then start charging 10 bucks each
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
time you you gave your oath when you uh
 
01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't think so I don't think that
 
01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.510 align:start position:0%
I I don't think so I don't think that
would

01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
work representative Lee
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair um I feel like
 
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
the the name of this is a little
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
misleading because it seems like it's
 
01:32:11.199 --> 01:32:12.030 align:start position:0%
misleading because it seems like it's
about

01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
$2 um what concerns me more is if I
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to run for
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
governor uh I would have to come up with
 
01:32:20.679 --> 01:32:23.070 align:start position:0%
governor uh I would have to come up with
$110,000

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
$110,000
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
instead of 100 am I reading this
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
right so it seems like a and b are like
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think you should have to
 
01:32:38.669 --> 01:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
come up with $10,000 to run for governor
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
so I guess that one's a bigger concern
 
01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:43.750 align:start position:0%
so I guess that one's a bigger concern
to

01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
me that's not in this bill I'm yeah Mr
 
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
chair so I know where she's getting it
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
from she's getting it it from the fiscal
 
01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
note but if you look at the fiscal note
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
this fiscal note was was written on
 
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
October of
 
01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.510 align:start position:0%
October of
2022

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
so I this is I don't think the fiscal
 
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
bill so are we talking about HB 116 yes
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
so on I'm looking on online so it
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have line
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
numbers um but it's Roman numeral one
 
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
candidates for Governor and then you
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
look down to a b CDE e f all we have I
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
St be an attempt last session thank you
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at oh you're looking at
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
the original Bill original Bill thank
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
you for clarifying that this whole time
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
I've been looking at the wrong version
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
thanks so as amended is what I want oh
 
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.109 align:start position:0%
thanks so as amended is what I want oh
here's

01:34:05.109 --> 01:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
here's
 
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
this represent
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
Bo my concern about taking away the $2
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
fee and not raising it I'm just
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
concerned are we going to have a flood
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
of candidates that just might come in
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
and you know want to put their name on
 
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
the ballot because it's free
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
let's hope so when they hear about it
 
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
they'll that's what I did it's not well
 
01:34:29.229 --> 01:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
the point is when it it's the
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
announcement comes out if you will for a
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
lack of a better way of saying it oh I
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
can I can register for free I mean it
 
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
would seem likely that it would make
 
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
more sense to raise the fee than to
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
eliminate the fee can can we do
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
that I mean in my mind there's some cost
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
for the for each town to do the paper
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
work so um I I mean I personally can go
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
either way on this but I'm I'm more
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
inclined to just leave this the way it
 
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
is leave the $2
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
because if the $2 is a barrier to entry
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
for you to apply for state
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
representative then you have bigger
 
01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
problems because because you're only
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
going to get $100 a year uh to do the
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
job representative
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
Ames my only comment on that is didto I
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.149 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh represent ery could we modify it to
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
require a $2 bill be
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
used we could but that might not be a
 
01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.750 align:start position:0%
used we could but that might not be a
good

01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
comments

01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and we will close the
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
hp16

01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to open the uh public
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
1054 relative to the northern border
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
Alliance program
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
fund representative plet we heard
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
testimony about how few
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
people were uh coming across that narrow
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
stretch of northern border and my
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
reaction was that's because we have this
 
01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
northern border Alliance program in
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
place it it it's so small um now I did
 
01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
raise questions whether it needed as
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
much money as it got uh after after
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
hearing that but I I'm not in favor at
 
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
all of uh eliminating the northern
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
border Reliance program keep it in place
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
secure yeses has nothing to do with
 
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
eliminating the northern border Alliance
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
program it has to do with removing
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
every two
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
years the excess that has not been
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
spent because it was not
 
01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
spent because it was not
needed

01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
fund which which then means that it has
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
reallocated uh every two years well I
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
take it yes it it has to be the way it's
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
written as I understand it it does uh
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
have to be reallocated every two years
 
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
anyway but if they
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
spend ,000 of it and don't spend the
 
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
rest uh in the two years when
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's worried about immigration
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
from Canada uh okay then
 
01:37:51.629 --> 01:37:51.639 align:start position:0%
um I think Canada is also so worried
 
01:37:56.589 --> 01:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
way well I I think one one of the things
 
01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:00.510 align:start position:0%
way well I I think one one of the things
that

01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
um they they were saying was the um
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
what's that the whole broad area there
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
um not tri-state area SW Swan thank you
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
um that there has been an increase in
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
that area and they were claiming not
 
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
much of an increase in our area but if
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
we I think the concern was that if we
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
get rid of our um if we don't refund
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
ours to the correct level wouldn't it be
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
human nature that people would then
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
start funneling across the Northern New
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire border representative fellows
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
um yes so this bill does only one thing
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
right now that's a non-aps fund so the
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
money goes in and at the end of the year
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
it if there's any
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
leftover it's not um
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
sent to it's not sent to doesn't become
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
Surplus and they would need an
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation every year anyway there's
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
no really no reason why this can't be
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
treated like a regular budget item and
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations made for it every two
 
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
years I looked up what this money can be
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
spent for it can be spent on
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
overtime um for officers which can be
 
01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
State Police or it can be local local
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
police or Homeland Security or even
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
fishing game it can be used for training
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
of of those uh participating officers
 
01:39:40.510 --> 01:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
including the overtime that they might
 
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh need when they're uh participating in
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
the training they can use it for
 
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
equipment but but the area they're
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
covering is restricted to within 25
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
miles of the border
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
so and it's wooded that's one of the
 
01:40:00.189 --> 01:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
issues about people come could come
 
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
through there um so what would they need
 
01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:05.719 align:start position:0%
for equipment maybe they need some ATVs
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think may people would
 
01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
try to come over in the winter but maybe
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
some snowmobiles not any huge piece
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
expensive piece of
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
equipment and the other um restriction
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
is that well they can't use it to for
 
01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
confidential informants and they can't
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
use it to supplant any um local budgets
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
so it's primarily based on expenditures
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
for for overtime and for just regular um
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
hourly rate I looked at the budget at
 
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
the expenditure so far this year what
 
01:40:44.109 --> 01:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
they had um not the budget the
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
expenditure report and they hadn't
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
really spent very much I can't remember
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
how much but it wasn't very much and it
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
was primarily for the salaries so I
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
don't think that they're going to
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
there's any loss to the program for
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
having it at having the amount of money
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
laps at the end of the year and treating
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
fund I would just ask the question
 
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
rather than making a statement the
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
question in my mind would be at a time
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
is this the right time to do something
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
like this when we know that we have a
 
01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
huge concern at the Southern border and
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
we have seen numbers increasing
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
dramatically on the Northern side I
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
would just ask why why now um it might
 
01:41:31.709 --> 01:41:31.719 align:start position:0%
be something to let's just see how
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
things go for a while before making a
 
01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
drastic uh change yes representative
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
leap Lee thank you um I think it's
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
precisely for the reason you say right
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
because across our budget our needs
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
change every single year and if we have
 
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
if our budget is locked into these
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
savings accounts for different uses then
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
we can't be responsive so I think we do
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
it for exactly the reason you're saying
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
like this year maybe they're going to
 
01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
spend their entire um allotment which is
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
great that's what the money's there for
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean that if they're not
 
01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
spending it this year that they're
 
01:42:09.149 --> 01:42:09.159 align:start position:0%
definitely going to need twice as much
 
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
the next year right so I think exactly
 
01:42:13.589 --> 01:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
to your point if we want to be
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
responsive we shouldn't just let money
 
01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
like build up in these little pockets we
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
should let it be
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
accessible cuz yes this year maybe they
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
do need it all representative
 
01:42:32.589 --> 01:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
Aly yes we did get uh verified by the
 
01:42:32.599 --> 01:42:34.669 align:start position:0%
Aly yes we did get uh verified by the
um

01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
attorney um see what what do they call
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
them the the district attorney for New
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on who is part of the state
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
Depart of the um AG's office in DC on
 
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
the data that showed that New Hampshire
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
had something what was it
 
01:42:56.719 --> 01:42:58.430 align:start position:0%
had something what was it
23

01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
23
 
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
um encounters and um and apprehensions
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
both encounters and in
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
apprehensions whereas the rest of the
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
sector had a great deal more and the
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
reason that that seems to be true is
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
that the northern our nor part of the
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
northern border is is not just forested
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's also filled with with
 
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
brush and it's
 
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
pretty I went and and straddled with my
 
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
sister a number of years ago the the um
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
top the beginning of the top Lake in in
 
01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is very close to the
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
border and we
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
bushwacked and it was really difficult
 
01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:53.790 align:start position:0%
bushwacked and it was really difficult
go

01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
and on
 
01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
Maine when I was younger there was a
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
road that went straight through the
 
01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
middle of the Northern woods of Maine
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
and across the border into Canada and
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
everybody used it and there was no no
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
border patrol at
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
all um and they said these are the
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
people that are going going up with drug
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
F that use that um they um they manage
 
01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
their forests rather different way than
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
we do so okay um yes representative
 
01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
roachford again I'm gonna probably get
 
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
off topic here but just want to provide
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
some perspective of what the Border
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
looks like up there I'm from from the
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
area um my neighbor is a border patrol
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
agent uh you know regardless of what we
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony there are have been
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
significant increases in apprehensions
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
up there um you know his his his again
 
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.270 align:start position:0%
up there um you know his his his again
um

01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotal testimony to me is it's people
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
that largely are living in Montreal the
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
families have been there for a long time
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
and they're looking at what's going on
 
01:45:10.830 --> 01:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
with our border and they're saying hey
 
01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:13.639 align:start position:0%
maybe now's the time to go and they go
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
um they're not bushwacking primarily
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing there Hall stream and
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh is a crossing point it's you
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
you can you can cross there and get your
 
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
ankles wet and that's that's where it is
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
but you know one of the things that we
 
01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:27.639 align:start position:0%
we have to take into account is the size
 
01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
of our border you know it's a very small
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
border it's 52 miles 58 miles but to put
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
that into perspective 58 miles if you
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
were standing down at the hookit Welcome
 
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
Center 58 miles would get you to
 
01:45:45.629 --> 01:45:45.639 align:start position:0%
Plymouth that's a huge amount of
 
01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
territory I mean we we say it's a small
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
amount of ter territory but it's but
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh but it really is quite large so
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't take much I think anyone
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
could probably slip through that here
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
around this table Yeah I voted against
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
this when it came to on the house floor
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
a year ago because quite frankly I don't
 
01:46:03.629 --> 01:46:03.639 align:start position:0%
think it's the state's responsibility to
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
be enforcing our national borders but
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
the reality is again from up there uh
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
hearing the people up there the concerns
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
of the people that I live with and grew
 
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
up with it is a concern uh of of of
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
what's happening and it isn't you know
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
the picture that we're getting down here
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
is different than what's actually
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
happening up there
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I get it this is all about a lapsing
 
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
fund versus a non-aps fund uh I would be
 
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
a I I think that that you know it's
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
taken me a year to get to this place but
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
I think the fund is worthwhile I think
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
the the program is
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
worthwhile um and you know for the at
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the day it may or may not
 
01:46:46.589 --> 01:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
make a difference whether it lapses or
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
not I don't know but if it means uh
 
01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
showing support for the program um again
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
I've come 180 degrees on this and after
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
listening to my my neighbors um you know
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
I I think that I I I would vote against
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
this 1054 U I think it has Merit and you
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
know I want to signal that it does have
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
Merit to the people that that I live
 
01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
with um up North so that's just my
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts on it thank you representa
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman one of
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
the pieces of information that I found
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
particularly important was that uh we
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
already get Federal money and we haven't
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
used all of it uh and we're not looking
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
at getting rid of the program we are
 
01:47:35.709 --> 01:47:35.719 align:start position:0%
simply saying let's lapse the fund and
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
reappropriate as we need it so if the
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
fund is entirely used as representative
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
leapley said entirely used within the
 
01:47:45.119 --> 01:47:46.709 align:start position:0%
leapley said entirely used within the
bium

01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
bium
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
we we're happy it's being used for its
 
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
stated purpose and if we need as much
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
again fine if we don't need as much we
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
can consider it but we should be looking
 
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
at the fact that we're not using the
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
funding that we already have for that
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.119 --> 01:48:13.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'll close the um work
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
session on HB
 
01:48:19.239 --> 01:48:20.950 align:start position:0%
session on HB
1054

01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
1054
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
now open the work session on HB 1193
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
relative to the establishment of a child
 
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.629 --> 01:48:33.639 align:start position:0%
program so I if I will can Mr chairman
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
this was a bill that I actually worked
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
on quite a bit over the summer and um I
 
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
think representative Sweeney
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh told the committee that he had a
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
similar bill that got in uh a day before
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
mine did so um he he I I was not allowed
 
01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
to put my bill in so we combined the two
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the bill and what we
 
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
got was um not what either one of us had
 
01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
intended and then there was some
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
questions at OS of you know who you know
 
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
did we miss a cut we missed a cutof date
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
for for um for uh revision I've got some
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
amendments that are not quite done yet
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
um that I think would clarify some of
 
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
the questions that were brought up in
 
01:49:24.669 --> 01:49:24.679 align:start position:0%
the committee uh in speaking with uh
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
some some folks on the other side of the
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
aisle on this and and in the other
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
chamber uh I had some good
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations on the fact that and and
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
this was a confusion point when at
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
testimony is we have a scholarship
 
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
program now in the state for lower
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
income folks and the design of this was
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
actually to continue to use the
 
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship program for those folks but
 
01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
it's just that next step up that needs
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
help I mean it's that
 
01:49:52.109 --> 01:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
you know when you make a dollar or two
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
more than the cut off line and you miss
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
out you're you're you actually take a
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
step back rather than a step forward and
 
01:49:59.070 --> 01:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
that's what this was designed to do is
 
01:50:02.109 --> 01:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
to catch that middle point and then you
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
know the means testing was also to the
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
point where if you made above a certain
 
01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
point you wouldn't qualify so it was
 
01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
initially really designed to hit a
 
01:50:14.189 --> 01:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
certain segment of people uh that wasn't
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't captured in the version that
 
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
we got um if if the if we could I I
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
would like a little more time on this to
 
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
work on this um you know and and come up
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
with a better Amendment if not I
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
understand and um would would you know
 
01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.709 --> 01:50:35.719 align:start position:0%
be representative
 
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
Ames I think that is what we need we
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
need a little more time um if we can
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
have it uh to um get that information
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
that you've developed get
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
the new draft Amendment and um
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
understand it and act on it uh but uh we
 
01:50:57.069 --> 01:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
need a little time to do that I think
 
01:50:59.069 --> 01:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
we've got the time I hope we
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
do okay um yes represent PL
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Rochford might have
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
answered my question I don't know but on
 
01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:07.950 align:start position:0%
answered my question I don't know but on
line

01:51:07.950 --> 01:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
11 it reads uh employee must earn
 
01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
between 103 and 50% of the federal
 
01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
poverty guidelines and I I Circle 100%
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
why couldn't they make lower than that
 
01:51:21.870 --> 01:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
is that's because is a separate section
 
01:51:24.069 --> 01:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
well that that as as it was my
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
understanding working with another you
 
01:51:29.069 --> 01:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
know official here um those folks
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
earning less actually do qualify for a
 
01:51:33.069 --> 01:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
scholarship program already in the state
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire which um so so we
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want
 
01:51:40.589 --> 01:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
to we wanted to ensure it was the people
 
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
at most vulnerable and most risk uh that
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know the lower income earners but
 
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're still earning we're still working
 
01:51:50.109 --> 01:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
and uh the Working Poor if you will um
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe even one step a little
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
bit above that who are doing well
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
they're they're making progress in life
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're they're they're
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
they're seeing
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
successes and that's the worst thing we
 
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
want to see is when you're seeing
 
01:52:07.229 --> 01:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
successes in life you take a program
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
that they've you know that has helped
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
that and then all of a sudden knock them
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
down you know far back so it it was more
 
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
of a gradual implementation over this
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
and that's where and that's the area
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's one of the areas that really does
 
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
need some work that I have I think a Sol
 
01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:21.669 align:start position:0%
need some work that I have I think a Sol
solution

01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
for how much time do you think you need
 
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
solution I I think I could have
 
01:52:30.589 --> 01:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
something next week and or or I mean if
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
we wanted to collaborate with other
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
folks on this do a subcommittee like we
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
were talking about I think that you know
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
we could do that too I think we have
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
until March on this um to get it out of
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
this committee but I do have a lot of
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
work put aside um that I've done on this
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
so I think I could probably move this
 
01:52:52.270 --> 01:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
along pretty quickly okay represent elmy
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to emphasize that tax
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
credits are a draw on our revenues which
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
is unpredictable unless you can do
 
01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
enough research to figure out okay how
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
how much is this likely to cost if we
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
expand it to 300% or whatever of of uh
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
poverty there's a limit on this 10
 
01:53:22.350 --> 01:53:22.360 align:start position:0%
million so if there is a limit on it of
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
10 million that may very well
 
01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:27.790 align:start position:0%
10 million that may very well
be

01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:53:31.629 --> 01:53:31.639 align:start position:0%
uh less than they get in
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
applications and you need to try to do
 
01:53:38.430 --> 01:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
all of the work to figure out
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
um what are you going to do is it going
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
to be prated like like the research and
 
01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
development tax credit uh what would the
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
timing be in terms of people finding out
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
whether they were going to get enough so
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
that they could afford to pay for the
 
01:53:57.119 --> 01:53:59.510 align:start position:0%
that they could afford to pay for the
child

01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
care sure so thank you yes and it was
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
based on the the research tax credit and
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
that's where we kind of took the um the
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the the the the uh structure
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
of this and at the end of the day the
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
the the people are going to the the the
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
people the residents are going to
 
01:54:20.589 --> 01:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
benefit IM immediately because their
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
employer is going to pay to going to pay
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
for their health their child care um it
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
would be the employer that's taking that
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
risk and it would be delayed a year and
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
they would know you know it may not be
 
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
100% it may be you know depending on how
 
01:54:37.390 --> 01:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
the popularity of the the program is we
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
set the or I set the the uh you know and
 
01:54:43.229 --> 01:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
again I I'm speaking for another
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative here but we when when I
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
did the research over the summer I put
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
the number at 10 million because I
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to go guard rail on it I didn't
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
want it to be a runaway program I didn't
 
01:54:56.910 --> 01:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
want it to be aund million program but I
 
01:54:59.069 --> 01:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be something where somebody
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
if if employers were were taking part in
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
it there would be enough in there for
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
you if you set it at
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
$500,000 and that that's going to chew
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
that up if you've got a 100 employees
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
employers taken care of so so that was
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
the the thought process but yes there
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
was a there's a stop on it and there was
 
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
stop was intentional because we don't
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
want to we don't want this to be a
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
runaway program
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
as the research and development tax
 
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
credit became and that's we said we
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
started it at 1 million I think and uh
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
not one million but we started it at a
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
one and uh a few years later pressure
 
01:55:42.069 --> 01:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
from the B Bia had gotten it up to 10
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
and at that point people said hey wait a
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
minute and and stopped the growth of it
 
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
but but anytime they could come in and
 
01:55:53.069 --> 01:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
say we need
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
15 because they are having to prate it
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think that's we have an
 
01:56:00.510 --> 01:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity as a you know to we we can
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
talk about what's the right number I
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
mean we you I I took ADV I I'm one that
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
has taken advantage of the research tax
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
credit I mean it's it's phenomenal it's
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
funded you know equipment Investments
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's funded a lot of things so so
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
you know having used some of these
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
things to grow a business stabilize a
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
business uh having been affected having
 
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
not been able to grow a business because
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have child care or my my
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
employees don't have child care I can
 
01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not a I was not a small
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
business person but uh these are the
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of things I think we can help in
 
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
but you know we are the experts on tax
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
credits you know whether we like it or
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
not right under this uh under under the
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
gold Dome so um that's why I'd like some
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
more time to really work and chew this
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
up and if it doesn't have legs it
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have legs but I think that I
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
think that you know knowing the top
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
topic of child care I mean I think we
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
owe it to the people in New Hampshire to
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
to put a little time into it and at
 
01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
least see if this is the right Avenue or
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
the right direction to do this yeah the
 
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
topic is really important the problem is
 
01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
that the cost is incredibly
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
huge representative fellows thank you um
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
I I like the idea of people getting more
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
child care Heth
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
um I it when I look at this to try to
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
put it together seems to me to be really
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
complicated because one of the things
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
representative Barry told us is that
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
um the people who qualify for the
 
01:57:41.950 --> 01:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
existing program which are like the
 
01:57:44.669 --> 01:57:44.679 align:start position:0%
vouchers that they get different amounts
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
of money depending on what their income
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
is and in the fiscal note it tells us
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
that they call that the child uh care
 
01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and that people in
 
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
that program can have an income up to
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
250% of the poverty limit so there are
 
01:58:09.149 --> 01:58:09.159 align:start position:0%
people already in that program that are
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
kind of like um aging out of it that
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're um voucher I'll
 
01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
call it a voucher it's
 
01:58:21.149 --> 01:58:21.159 align:start position:0%
shrinks so to try to put two different
 
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
sources feeding help for child care I
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
think that they're not going to be in
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
sync because the business is going to
 
01:58:34.109 --> 01:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
help with their people some of which
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
maybe are already there may be somebody
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
in in the existing program that's
 
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
getting close to that to say they're at
 
01:58:45.069 --> 01:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
200% of property so they're getting some
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
money and then they're going to fill in
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
different amounts for different
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
employees depending if they don't get
 
01:58:54.669 --> 01:58:54.679 align:start position:0%
any now and I think the whole thing to
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
try to meld the two together seems
 
01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.310 align:start position:0%
try to meld the two together seems
really

01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
complicated yeah and I agree with you
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
100% And and that was one of the areas
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
where when we put the two bills together
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh represent Swede and I were like we
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
got to fix this because this isn't what
 
01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
we intended and this is this is going to
 
01:59:13.149 --> 01:59:13.159 align:start position:0%
get real confusing and it did get
 
01:59:16.069 --> 01:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
confusing um I think I have something
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
that will cut that confusion U because
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
when we were again and we were you know
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
blame it on my rookie status you know I
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear on um some of the dates and
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
cut off lines and whatnot um but these
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
were all he he and I were communicating
 
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
and lo and behold the date the P the the
 
01:59:37.709 --> 01:59:37.719 align:start position:0%
the time passes and we you know we
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
missed it but you're absolutely right
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
100% when we heard the testimony when
 
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
you start mixing all these programs
 
01:59:46.069 --> 01:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
together it was this is far more
 
01:59:48.189 --> 01:59:48.199 align:start position:0%
confusing than I had ever intended and
 
01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
it's definit and it's more confusing
 
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
than he ever intended and we recognize
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
that uh that's why I think we can get
 
01:59:57.629 --> 01:59:57.639 align:start position:0%
something that would at least if we can
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
cut back some of the static if you will
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
and focus on on on what we're trying to
 
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
do here I think it will make more sense
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
and a little more time I think would
 
02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
would help with
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
that represent Aly yeah there's another
 
02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
problem here which is that page two is a
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
totally different program and expense
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
note the child care tax credit uh for
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
expenditures for maternity or paternity
 
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
leave greater than 12 weeks which is
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
another thing that the Democrats would
 
02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
like to have but um it's kind of does
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
this stay in there because it's
 
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
not the fiscal the school note didn't
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
seem to notice
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
it yeah that's that's a good question
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
that was not part of the work that I had
 
02:00:59.470 --> 02:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
initially brought forward as part of
 
02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
Representative Sweeny which again when
 
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it maternity and
 
02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
paternity leave as a as a small employer
 
02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
you know I can speak for a small
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
employer that's something that you'd
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
love to be able to to to provide and and
 
02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
and give but there's generally not a lot
 
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
left in the pot to to do that so we felt
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
that incentivizing this at the end of
 
02:01:25.709 --> 02:01:25.719 align:start position:0%
the day this this bill just incentivizes
 
02:01:29.790 --> 02:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
employers to to do certain things and um
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
and and hopefully there's some help to
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
do it um that's a good question that was
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
you know we can okay we can chew that up
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
I like the I when when he mentioned that
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
to me I like the idea again I think in
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
my business we've had six kids um you
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
know over the course of 15 years so not
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
my kids but uh employees kids but um you
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
know so I I can relate to that I
 
02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
understand that and I understand what
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
folks go through so um but you're right
 
02:01:58.830 --> 02:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
that wasn't part of the fiscal note I
 
02:02:01.069 --> 02:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
don't know why that was missed but uh
 
02:02:04.109 --> 02:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
but I think you know we can you know
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
that may or may not stay we can talk
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
about that and another thing which may
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
be or may not be complicating is that
 
02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:13.229 align:start position:0%
be or may not be complicating is that
the

02:02:13.229 --> 02:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:13.239 --> 02:02:15.069 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
on Community Development Loan Fund I
 
02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
think it's called I can't remember now
 
02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:23.870 align:start position:0%
think it's called I can't remember now
um

02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:25.629 align:start position:0%
um
they

02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:02:28.350 --> 02:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
on this has been going for a very long
 
02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
time and one of the things that it does
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
is to uh provide money to employers to
 
02:02:37.470 --> 02:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
build child care
 
02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
centers that could have people from
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
outside of the business but that are
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
basically for the business um that get
 
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
tax credits that they then have to go
 
02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
sell to people people in order to do it
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's done a lot of child
 
02:02:55.629 --> 02:02:55.639 align:start position:0%
care though yeah I
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
um if I may I we I looked at that we I
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
so there I think there was about 17
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
states around the country that do
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
something for child care and of course
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
we don't even income tax for for
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
individuals so a lot of those programs
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
were based on individual income tax some
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
of them were based on exactly what you
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
were talking about large employers
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
building things and I think you're right
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
you can buy tax credits for that but you
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
know aside from a few larger employers
 
02:03:24.629 --> 02:03:24.639 align:start position:0%
it's mostly small employers you know
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
that are paying business profit tax or
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise taxes um so you know
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
being creative on how to how to how to
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
work around that is where we you we
 
02:03:36.669 --> 02:03:36.679 align:start position:0%
targeted that but it's not a new idea
 
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's not a New Concept there's many
 
02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
states and I don't think any state is
 
02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
exactly the same everyone's doing it uh
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
differently and U you know so I think we
 
02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more hands we'll close
 
02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
1193 next up hb1 1470 establishing a
 
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
study committee on the feasibility and
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
impact of lowincome housing tax
 
02:04:12.270 --> 02:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
credit representative PL I just have
 
02:04:14.350 --> 02:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
questions what possible tax credit could
 
02:04:16.350 --> 02:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
there be that applies to low income
 
02:04:20.189 --> 02:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
that's a state tax uh swept they're
 
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
they're not paying that directly anyway
 
02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
if they're low income more likely
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
renting so I'm not sure what the study
 
02:04:27.149 --> 02:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
committee would come up with anything
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
but I'm not opposed to a study committee
 
02:04:29.679 --> 02:04:31.189 align:start position:0%
but I'm not opposed to a study committee
representative

02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:04:35.229 --> 02:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
Aly yes um I'm not sure where I stand on
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
this now because I really don't like tax
 
02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
credits but uh
 
02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
the the what they mean by a lowincome
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit is a tax credit for a
 
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
one or more on groups that are together
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
building a
 
02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.310 align:start position:0%
building a
lowincome

02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
lowincome
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
development not directly to lowincome
 
02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
people but of course don't need a tax
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
credit and the tax credit is applied to
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
what the BPT yeah it is something that
 
02:05:18.910 --> 02:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
is done in most places in the country
 
02:05:22.549 --> 02:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
the ones with income taxes or big sales
 
02:05:22.559 --> 02:05:24.310 align:start position:0%
the ones with income taxes or big sales
taxes

02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:26.950 align:start position:0%
taxes
um

02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
and but I personally don't understand
 
02:05:35.709 --> 02:05:35.719 align:start position:0%
what three people meeting together after
 
02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
they've been appointed by the speaker
 
02:05:41.229 --> 02:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
and the the president of the Senate are
 
02:05:44.229 --> 02:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.229 --> 02:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
with in a few
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
months represent of Fells so I I have
 
02:05:54.430 --> 02:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
you know um when the sponsor was here he
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
gave us a piece of paper with something
 
02:06:00.510 --> 02:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
written in to be an amendment but we
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a official Amendment do we no
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
but the only thing that he did was he he
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
said that they could also study other
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
tax incentives to increase the
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
production and affordability of housing
 
02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
legislation which it could do anyway but
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
November yes so so I I
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
would support
 
02:06:41.790 --> 02:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
this if we could get the amendment
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
except that I where where it says um the
 
02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
the addition and other tax incentives I
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
would just like to cross out the tax so
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
it could be they can study lowincome
 
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
housing tax credits
 
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
and other incentives to you know look at
 
02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
the possibly helping the situation just
 
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
not to be so restrictive that it's even
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
just tax incentives and I'm my
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
expectation would be that um whoever's
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the committee would be spending
 
02:07:19.709 --> 02:07:19.719 align:start position:0%
pretty much all of their time with New
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Authority and to
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%

place and seeing if they new the Housing
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
Authority has any recommendations on
 
02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.229 --> 02:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
useful um the Housing Authority is
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%

are the state's um administrator and
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
allocator of the federal low-income
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit which as
 
02:08:04.990 --> 02:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
representative Aly described is is an
 
02:08:07.629 --> 02:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
incentive for private Market developers
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
to do this sort of stuff um and it works
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
really well of the mic please and many
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
sorry many and many states do have a
 
02:08:18.669 --> 02:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
state uh low-income housing tax ta
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
credit uh we stand ready to uh help a
 
02:08:25.549 --> 02:08:25.559 align:start position:0%
study committee uh even if it is just
 
02:08:29.229 --> 02:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
three people uh to uh provide as much
 
02:08:31.549 --> 02:08:31.559 align:start position:0%
information as we possibly can on what
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
other states are doing and what might be
 
02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah um I sort of asked this
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
question last time
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't think it was answered
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
um and I did some exploring subsequently
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
my question relates to for States as
 
02:09:02.109 --> 02:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to the federal level um what
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
exactly are the taxes against which the
 
02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
credit is taken and um in New Hampshire
 
02:09:13.709 --> 02:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
as we all know there's no income tax or
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
nor a general sales tax um but but I did
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
find out that in some other states
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
um uh the credit is taken against well
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
in one case the insurance an insurance
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
tax another case a
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
business tax would' be some parallel to
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
our own business profits tax um and um I
 
02:09:40.109 --> 02:09:40.119 align:start position:0%
don't know whether you've got more
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
information on the because that's that's
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
something that stuck out of me we're
 
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
talking about tax credit tax credit
 
02:09:49.069 --> 02:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
against what we're
 
02:09:50.750 --> 02:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
where's the money coming from or coming
 
02:09:53.109 --> 02:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
out of what pot uh we really need to
 
02:09:55.069 --> 02:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
know that and so if you've got any
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
insights on that I'd appreciate it well
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
just off the cuff representative Ames I
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
I think the uh most likely uh taxes to
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
take a credit against would be the
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and the business
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax also the insurance
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
premiums tax uh th those are uh subject
 
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
to other tax credits uh already uh in
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
existence in New Hampshire
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
um we we would all obviously look at
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
others but you know those are the the
 
02:10:25.709 --> 02:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
big drivers and those are those are the
 
02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
ones where the uh businesses that might
 
02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:29.350 align:start position:0%
ones where the uh businesses that might
be

02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:10:33.069 --> 02:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
investors uh uh in this sort of um
 
02:10:42.510 --> 02:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
interest commenting on this um
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
this is uh the kind of matter that I
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
think we should seriously look at and
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
explore um I'm not sure we can afford
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
going very deep with such a tax credit
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
this kind of tax credit but let's look
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
at it and figure that out uh housing
 
02:11:08.350 --> 02:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
lowincome housing is uh we don't have
 
02:11:10.270 --> 02:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
enough of it I mean that's all I can say
 
02:11:13.549 --> 02:11:13.559 align:start position:0%
on that score by a long shot and uh so
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
why not let's explore it I would like to
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
see an amendment that added to the
 
02:11:20.189 --> 02:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
members of the commit membership of the
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee I think three is I'm not sure
 
02:11:25.629 --> 02:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
I've seen a a committee like this set up
 
02:11:28.709 --> 02:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
with just three people or maybe it's
 
02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
maybe it is a practice I don't know but
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh but it's it it gets to be very
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
difficult to organize meetings and uh
 
02:11:38.589 --> 02:11:38.599 align:start position:0%
you know to have the
 
02:11:42.030 --> 02:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
work uh force in the committee uh
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient to get the job done and to
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
have a range of points of view too and
 
02:11:48.990 --> 02:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
we definitely want to be sure that you
 
02:11:51.790 --> 02:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
know the range of viewpoints on this
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
kind of issue in the legislature is
 
02:11:55.470 --> 02:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
represented on the committee it's hard
 
02:11:57.390 --> 02:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
to do that with three
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:05.549 --> 02:12:05.559 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
02:12:09.549 --> 02:12:09.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question um it so what I hear
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
you saying is that other states have
 
02:12:15.549 --> 02:12:15.559 align:start position:0%
incentives in place is that correct that
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
is correct okay um it seems to me like
 
02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
what I hear people addressing is whether
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
they think a tax credit is a good idea
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
or not I don't think that's the question
 
02:12:28.750 --> 02:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
I think the question is precisely
 
02:12:31.870 --> 02:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
um to explore this right like that's
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
what a study committee does and I what I
 
02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
hear from business owners for example
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking like you know Main Street
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester you look and you're like are
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
there apartments above every single one
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
of these businesses and as it turns out
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
there aren't and why not because it's
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
super expensive right so are there ways
 
02:12:54.030 --> 02:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
that we can can support people who would
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:12:58.549 --> 02:12:58.559 align:start position:0%
invest in our main streets and you know
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
put in the sprinkler system or you know
 
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
could they do this floor and then that
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
floor it seems like basically what we're
 
02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
saying is do we want to help solve this
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
problem do we want to sit around a table
 
02:13:10.589 --> 02:13:10.599 align:start position:0%
and talk about you know what are other
 
02:13:12.390 --> 02:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
states doing what are other incentives
 
02:13:15.149 --> 02:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
Beyond tax incentives
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
and um I think it's true that people's
 
02:13:23.229 --> 02:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
really small um having attended the the
 
02:13:27.549 --> 02:13:27.559 align:start position:0%
uh big study on uh worldwide taxation I
 
02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
found it really helpful to invite
 
02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
experts in and here I feel like that's
 
02:13:35.149 --> 02:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
how we we grow and learn what's out
 
02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:37.599 align:start position:0%
there as possible and maybe even
 
02:13:39.549 --> 02:13:39.559 align:start position:0%
innovate as a state because I think we
 
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
are very Innovative and I think that
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
would it creates a space where we can
 
02:13:45.870 --> 02:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
think about this very very important
 
02:13:48.549 --> 02:13:48.559 align:start position:0%
issue so I'm in favor of this thanks
 
02:13:48.559 --> 02:13:50.990 align:start position:0%
issue so I'm in favor of this thanks
thank

02:13:50.990 --> 02:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:13:56.589 --> 02:13:56.599 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman Mr Frost
 
02:13:59.790 --> 02:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
are you aware of um programs through the
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
federal GSA the general Services
 
02:14:04.350 --> 02:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
Administration and Department of
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
Transportation where they are looking to
 
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
uh basically offload some of their
 
02:14:12.549 --> 02:14:12.559 align:start position:0%
buildings that they're not using anymore
 
02:14:15.549 --> 02:14:15.559 align:start position:0%
and I see that you are are there any
 
02:14:17.709 --> 02:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
unused Federal buildings in the state
 
02:14:17.719 --> 02:14:18.790 align:start position:0%
unused Federal buildings in the state
that

02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
some work could be applied
 
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
to thank you for that question and and I
 
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that GSA does have a process
 
02:14:29.549 --> 02:14:29.559 align:start position:0%
for Surplus um know Surplus Federal
 
02:14:32.669 --> 02:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
property uh I I've not looked into this
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
closely uh I I know that
 
02:14:37.950 --> 02:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
well I hesitate to bring it up but the
 
02:14:40.510 --> 02:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
McIntyre building in Portsmouth um is
 
02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
one such building uh that you know was
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
Federal property and and the city's
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what to do with it
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm sure there are others as well
 
02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to State Surplus property
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
yes uh there in fact there is a very um
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh effective process
 
02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
for state agencies to declare uh
 
02:15:06.669 --> 02:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
property that they control as Surplus to
 
02:15:09.149 --> 02:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
the needs of the state and that goes to
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
other agencies first to see if they have
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
the need for the property and can
 
02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
transfer it from one agency to another
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
and then if if that is not the case then
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
um then it gets put through a process
 
02:15:24.030 --> 02:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
where it's offered and depending upon
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
how the property was acquired by the
 
02:15:28.350 --> 02:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
state than it is offered to the
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
municipality in which it is situated and
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
or New Hampshire housing uh and in some
 
02:15:36.310 --> 02:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances we have a preemptive right
 
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
to acquire uh those properties if we
 
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
want to we have a great working
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
relationship with the Department of
 
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation and we're in negotiations
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
right now on several Parcels of property
 
02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:52.599 align:start position:0%
um I I was on a couple of Zoom calls
 
02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
with the GSA and the Federal Department
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
of Transportation at the end of last
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
year they are happy
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
to not give but help to give at
 
02:16:08.669 --> 02:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
incredibly low
 
02:16:13.149 --> 02:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
rates um including wonderful financing
 
02:16:16.510 --> 02:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
systems as bonds ra as as loans rather
 
02:16:18.589 --> 02:16:18.599 align:start position:0%
than as bonds
 
02:16:21.790 --> 02:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
um and I would hope that we are looking
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
at Federal
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
properties if there are any in the state
 
02:16:28.549 --> 02:16:28.559 align:start position:0%
I don't know enough about Federal
 
02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
properties in the state with your
 
02:16:33.389 --> 02:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
prompting I I suspect we will be please
 
02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
do and and uh I have they would they
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
would not do any recordings but I took
 
02:16:42.469 --> 02:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
02:16:47.549 --> 02:16:47.559 align:start position:0%
Rochford yes thank you Mr chairman just
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
I just got to I'm just looking back at
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
the bill here it's pretty open-ended I
 
02:16:53.870 --> 02:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
mean there's not really a lot of the
 
02:16:56.669 --> 02:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
objectives are not defined per se other
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
than it's to study a feasibility of
 
02:17:00.190 --> 02:17:00.200 align:start position:0%
low-income tax credit you may have said
 
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
this before is there some type of
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
Federal grant program behind this or is
 
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
this strictly what we can do as a state
 
02:17:11.230 --> 02:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
representative great question and I
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
think the answer is uh remains to be
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
seen I'm sorry that this yeah I know
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's part I get it every day
 
02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
um I think I can do that without
 
02:17:22.830 --> 02:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
unplugging it
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
um so in in other states uh there are uh
 
02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
state tax credits that work in alignment
 
02:17:34.990 --> 02:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
with the federal low-income housing tax
 
02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
credit and it's possible for New
 
02:17:39.150 --> 02:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to design something like that
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
to leverage uh the federal programs uh
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
also uh it it's possible to come up with
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
something that is is flexible and can do
 
02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
that leveraging Federal resources or
 
02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:54.519 align:start position:0%
that also works independently of federal
 
02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
resources in cases where the the federal
 
02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
programs don't work that well okay thank
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
you can I add I like my colleague here I
 
02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
I would support this um you know this is
 
02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
a need you know especially in
 
02:18:13.150 --> 02:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
my my part of the world uh housing is a
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
huge issue and and and I look at it you
 
02:18:18.669 --> 02:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
know we've got business that can't grow
 
02:18:20.349 --> 02:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
because they can't hire people and they
 
02:18:21.549 --> 02:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
can't hire people because they have no
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
place to put them um and we've got
 
02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
buildings on lanc on Main Street in
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
Lancaster that have Apartments the only
 
02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
way to get them is the companies to buy
 
02:18:33.150 --> 02:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
the buildings so uh to put these in
 
02:18:35.070 --> 02:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
there the only thing that I would
 
02:18:37.389 --> 02:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
actually perhaps put together as an
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
amendment is to change the spectrum of
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
the study is to look at uh lowincome and
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing uh because it's not
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
just low-income housing that we're
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
needing up north it's Workforce housing
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's people that you know have a skill
 
02:18:55.150 --> 02:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
have a trade U but even with that they
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
can't they can't find a place to live
 
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
and I personally as you couldn't tell I
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
like tax credits I've used them um you
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
know I think that they can be managed uh
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
but again this is an opportunity to to
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
study it I mean it's not we're not it's
 
02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
not costing us anything to take a look
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
at and at the end of the day we may find
 
02:19:16.349 --> 02:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
out that it's not works but I think uh I
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
could get behind this with a couple of
 
02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:21.790 align:start position:0%
could get behind this with a couple of
tweaks

02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
tweaks
 
02:19:25.309 --> 02:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
okay any yes
 
02:19:27.309 --> 02:19:27.319 align:start position:0%
representative I would just like to know
 
02:19:30.270 --> 02:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
is someone from this committee going to
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
stop by and see
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
the sponsor about making an amendment
 
02:19:39.629 --> 02:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to is that all right with you
 
02:19:41.549 --> 02:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman well the spon yeah the
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor doesn't have to make the
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
Amendments well I understand that I just
 
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
and follow up on
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
this instead of two members of the House
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
what would this committee think of a
 
02:20:00.670 --> 02:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
higher number like
 
02:20:14.429 --> 02:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
you said
 
02:20:16.359 --> 02:20:18.990 align:start position:0%
you said
Le

02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
Le
 
02:20:20.429 --> 02:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
all right so this would be one bill that
 
02:20:23.429 --> 02:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
we will so most likely not EXA tomorrow
 
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
because uh it sounds like some
 
02:20:29.070 --> 02:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
additional information is needed yes so
 
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
I would like to suggest um four house
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
members in specify that two are
 
02:20:36.390 --> 02:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
Democrats and two are
 
02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:37.630 align:start position:0%
Democrats and two are
[Music]

02:20:37.630 --> 02:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
Republicans just I'm thinking that
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
Republicans are really good at focusing
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
on on tax credits and I think the
 
02:20:47.389 --> 02:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
Democrats may have some other
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
perspectives you know I don't want to
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
get you know end up with only looking at
 
02:20:54.910 --> 02:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
tax credits cuz I think that there are
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
other opportunities
 
02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
too okay represent Aly yes um
 
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
I thank you I set up 12 years ago now a
 
02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee to try to do something about
 
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
the massive condominium problems and um
 
02:21:21.550 --> 02:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate took their second member off
 
02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
it and nobody added an extra House
 
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:33.910 --> 02:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
quorum well there'll be one
 
02:21:37.870 --> 02:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
Senator yeah yeah
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
sure you mean three house members and
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
one Senator that's what we
 
02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:45.910 align:start position:0%
one Senator that's what we
had

02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
four house one Senator that's five yeah
 
02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:56.670 align:start position:0%
four house one Senator that's five yeah
that's

02:21:56.670 --> 02:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
fine okay so it sounds like a couple
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
members are going to work uh together to
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
come up with a possible Amendment on
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
this um yeah and I just wanted to add
 
02:22:13.950 --> 02:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
something there a lot I'm not I don't
 
02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
think it's terribly been terribly
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
effective but a lot of work has been put
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
into Workforce housing
 
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
already um that the
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
lowincome has
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
had the the governor put a 100 million
 
02:22:33.070 --> 02:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
into it this last
 
02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
term um and was forced by the executive
 
02:22:40.910 --> 02:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
Council to add a little bit of lowincome
 
02:22:44.429 --> 02:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
housing in it uh I'm not sure how that's
 
02:22:44.439 --> 02:22:45.990 align:start position:0%
housing in it uh I'm not sure how that's
working

02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
but but but
 
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if it expanded into to
 
02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:55.670 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if it expanded into to
low

02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
low
 
02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
income lowi income is a very different
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
kind of animal
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
than than
 
02:23:07.950 --> 02:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce in my opinion at least uh but
 
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
it does include the workforce part that
 
02:23:13.070 --> 02:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
most people don't think of as Workforce
 
02:23:14.830 --> 02:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
which is all of the supporting
 
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
characters that keep keep a business
 
02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
working your cleaners
 
02:23:24.750 --> 02:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe the
 
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
secretaries if there are any left did
 
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
you have a response to that or U not
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
that you have to have one I was just I I
 
02:23:34.429 --> 02:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
I would note that uh Workforce housing
 
02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
has a
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
specific uh and precise definition under
 
02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law and that is found in
 
02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:42.070 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law and that is found in
RSA

02:23:42.070 --> 02:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
674 59 I believe um and it is housing
 
02:23:49.070 --> 02:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
rental housing that is Affordable to a
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
family of three that makes uh up to um
 
02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
60% of the area median
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
income uh and that's at a 30% cost
 
02:24:02.110 --> 02:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
burden that's paying no more than 30% of
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
their income or a um home for purchase
 
02:24:09.790 --> 02:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
that is Affordable at 100% of the median
 
02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
income uh area median income for a
 
02:24:15.710 --> 02:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
family of four so that it's very clear
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
what constitutes Workforce housing
 
02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:19.990 align:start position:0%
what constitutes Workforce housing
low-income

02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
low-income
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
housing um it depends on which
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
definition you're looking at and there
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
are multiple
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
definitions generally speaking it's on
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
the rental side it is close to the
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
definition of Workforce housing um so I
 
02:24:40.349 --> 02:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
think I think there would be no harm in
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
adding Workforce housing they in they
 
02:24:45.790 --> 02:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
are often times roughly equivalent
 
02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce and low-income housing where
 
02:24:50.269 --> 02:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
they differ is on the purchase side
 
02:24:52.510 --> 02:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't typically talk about
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
low income and purchase housing together
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay um representative elberger had her
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
hand thank you Mr chairman just pointing
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
out that in
 
02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
Nashua where we have just as many other
 
02:25:08.190 --> 02:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
communities a significant homeless
 
02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
population many of them are working two
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
jobs a couple I spoke with each of them
 
02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
was working two jobs and still could not
 
02:25:20.030 --> 02:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
afford a place to rent so I would
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
support the notion of adding Workforce
 
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
housing into this represent all me
 
02:25:28.429 --> 02:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
follow by fellows I'm not sure whether
 
02:25:33.950 --> 02:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
we Sorry whether we'd need to Define
 
02:25:37.150 --> 02:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce again within this bill if we
 
02:25:40.030 --> 02:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
include Workforce because the governor's
 
02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
program was definitely not focused on
 
02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
is there a definition of Workforce
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
housing in the rsas or
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
no yes that is
 
02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:02.150 align:start position:0%
no yes that is
67459

02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
67459
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay you could also on other levels of
 
02:26:09.870 --> 02:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
income you could make reference
 
02:26:13.230 --> 02:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
to RSA
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
204c colon 57 I believe believe uh which
 
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
is a subdivision in the um New Hampshire
 
02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:25.720 align:start position:0%

02:26:28.510 --> 02:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
deals with the affordable housing fund
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
and so there are different levels of
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
income that are very specific similar to
 
02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh the way Workforce housing is
 
02:26:40.349 --> 02:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
defined represent fellows so that last
 
02:26:42.670 --> 02:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
one you mentioned is that for buying a
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
house or is can is that for apartments
 
02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
that's either
 
02:26:50.830 --> 02:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
either well I think that's why we need
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
the study
 
02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%

this up
 
02:27:50.190 --> 02:27:50.200 align:start position:0%

finish that up before lunch no I'm
 
02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:53.680 align:start position:0%

and maybe I shouldn't because I'm
 
02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
getting but to me this is a no-brainer
 
02:28:14.190 --> 02:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
the pass because it's money that's
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
coming for uh for

02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
going into the general fund we should
 
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
put it in a trust fund for that purpose
 
02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
and it's got it says if it's not after
 
02:28:31.870 --> 02:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
used by after two years it could be
 
02:28:34.990 --> 02:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
moved uh and I think that's a good
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
idea representative
 
02:28:41.790 --> 02:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you um we discuss this a lot
 
02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
in caucus and there are a number of of
 
02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
problems with it that representative
 
02:28:53.309 --> 02:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
moose is already working on and we'd
 
02:28:56.590 --> 02:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
really like to give him the
 
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
time on to absorb all of of for instance
 
02:29:07.710 --> 02:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
um the the example he was using of
 
02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
contamination uh I forget what substance
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
it was but it was uh outlawed in the 70s
 
02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
and it was uh
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
was contaminating on land and they
 
02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
they've cleaned up the land but in the
 
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
process it went down into the waters we
 
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's any way to clean
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
up that
 
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
substance in the water in the water is
 
02:29:41.950 --> 02:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
very a very difficult thing and so the
 
02:29:44.269 --> 02:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
the money would just sit there for two
 
02:29:46.750 --> 02:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
years and then get put in these other
 
02:29:48.670 --> 02:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
and two years doesn't seem like quite
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
enough to figure out how we're going to
 
02:29:56.190 --> 02:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
handle this either uh so
 
02:29:56.200 --> 02:29:58.750 align:start position:0%
handle this either uh so
um

02:29:58.750 --> 02:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:01.469 --> 02:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
he's and it's obvious that it would only
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
be for smaller level contaminations
 
02:30:08.269 --> 02:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
because when it's past they're going to
 
02:30:11.269 --> 02:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
put it all in one one new
 
02:30:15.309 --> 02:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
section um so there could be quite a lot
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
of these little things things for a
 
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
while hanging around for two years
 
02:30:23.230 --> 02:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
before they go off into one of the two
 
02:30:23.240 --> 02:30:24.230 align:start position:0%
before they go off into one of the two
two

02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
funds and that isn't what they really
 
02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
meant to be
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
doing so he's he's work he'd already
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
realized some of this and he's working
 
02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
on it and um we're
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
communicating we'd like
 
02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to to put it off for a
 
02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:47.710 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to to put it off for a
later

02:30:47.710 --> 02:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:51.429 align:start position:0%

02:30:51.429 --> 02:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:51.439 --> 02:30:56.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%

repres
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
question see an amendment come back in
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
here yeah put it into a committee study
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
or something sub committee something
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
yeah he has a partial Amendment now but
 
02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
it was just his first draft that we all
 
02:31:12.429 --> 02:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
got well are you looking for a work
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
study on once his Amendment comes back
 
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
oh wait I meant I meant work session but
 
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%

02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
let's just recap on the ones that need
 
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
more time um obviously the one we just
 
02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:53.870 align:start position:0%
more time um obviously the one we just
discussed

02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
02:31:59.230 --> 02:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
1613 um sounds 1193 the child care tax
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
program um because this whole list is is
 
02:32:04.750 --> 02:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
the list for tomorrow to be potentially
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
exec along with 1254 which I see we have
 
02:32:09.910 --> 02:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment before
 
02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:12.309 align:start position:0%
an amendment before
us

02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:32:14.830 --> 02:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
um what other was there anything else
 
02:32:19.550 --> 02:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative du said spring an
 
02:32:24.070 --> 02:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
amendment on 1525 but we should have
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
that for
 
02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um representative PL you're
 
02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
going to have an amendment for
 
02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
1203 J for four puted in for me okay so
 
02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
you just have to make sure that we have
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
that for tomorrow
 
02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:39.710 align:start position:0%
that for tomorrow
yes

02:32:39.710 --> 02:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:32:43.230 --> 02:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
um so other than other than that it
 
02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
looks like um there's only two that were
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
holding off right now is that true 1193
 
02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
and 1613 or feel like there was one
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
missing yeah 12 that's representative PL
 
02:33:07.790 --> 02:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
is bringing
 
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
1470 oh right for uh right so 1470
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:29.950 --> 02:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
1389 that's the lottery one that
 
02:33:36.590 --> 02:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.349 --> 02:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
it to put back 35% no no no no no I
 
02:33:44.670 --> 02:33:44.680 align:start position:0%
think that was the anonymous yeah that
 
02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
we we found that had some
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
errors in it 1389 to me is an itl for
 
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
the moment the the the notes I have is
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
that we're either going to go itl or is
 
02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
on that um so I think we can do that
 
02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:59.510 align:start position:0%
on that um so I think we can do that
tomorrow

02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
just the one with the putting the 35% is
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:10.830 --> 02:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
1203 I'd to just mention that the
 
02:34:16.349 --> 02:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that I passed out um I the
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
first time read the two parts of it
 
02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
together and they don't make sense
 
02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
together uh there was one word uh that I
 
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
need to change on line 20 which is not
 
02:34:36.030 --> 02:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
the 800 uh 184 days of the uh meals and
 
02:34:38.910 --> 02:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
rooms tax requirement uh microphone
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
please oh sorry
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
on I we need to change just one thing uh
 
02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
online 20 chain um the amendment 124
 
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
1254 yeah that we didn't discuss what
 
02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
does that have to change to uh to 30
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
because it's 30 above so 184 changes to
 
02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
30 yeah okay it would be much different
 
02:35:04.110 --> 02:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
limit can you make sure that we have
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
that first than the rooms and meals
 
02:35:12.670 --> 02:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
tax which by the way is 184 days okay so
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
you can get that can you I didn't I
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
didn't catch that so line so the
 
02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have for 1254 line
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
20 it says 184 days that's going to
 
02:35:27.269 --> 02:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
change to 30 and and I'll go get that as
 
02:35:29.469 --> 02:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
soon as we've had our other
 
02:35:32.070 --> 02:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
meeting do we have two
 
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
amendments I just have one it's uh
 
02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
1254 the amendment uh Amendment uh
 
02:35:40.389 --> 02:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
where's line
 
02:35:44.309 --> 02:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
20 here's mine only goes to 11 you got
 
02:35:45.550 --> 02:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
the short hand version you got the
 
02:35:49.630 --> 02:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
original one I put one on your in your
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
place it's Aly Buco it's a joint
 
02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:56.469 align:start position:0%
place it's Aly Buco it's a joint
Amendment

02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right I think um so so really
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's the last three that we will not
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
take up tomorrow
 
02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:05.670 align:start position:0%
take up tomorrow
1193

02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
1193
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
1470 and
 
02:36:11.230 --> 02:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
1613 the rest of them we will take up
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow plus 12:54 and representative
 
02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
Al is going to get a um an update to
 
02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
line 20 all right I don't have anything
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
else um let me just look at the
 
02:36:28.230 --> 02:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
schedule for next week so we'll all um
 
02:36:31.150 --> 02:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
we'll see you uh tomorrow at 10 o'clock
 
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
for the exec session and then next the
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:40.590 --> 02:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
um actually the following week Happ
 
02:36:43.230 --> 02:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
what's that it's going to be it's not
 
02:36:45.150 --> 02:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
Monday's a holiday so we are not meeting
 
02:36:48.429 --> 02:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
Monday uh we will meet Tuesday I haven't
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
put that together yet as to what that
 
02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
might be a combination of public
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
hearings I think there's there's either
 
02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
three or four new bills that we have in
 
02:36:59.389 --> 02:36:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
um uh I I don't know I just I looked
 
02:37:04.349 --> 02:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
before we started there was 18 bills in
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
our committee we had I'm not sure it was
 
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
28 or 29 a few days ago so we
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
dispatched I believe 11 of them so that
 
02:37:17.630 --> 02:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
I think there's four new ones so so um
 
02:37:19.990 --> 02:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
between So the plan is to meet Tuesday
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
and Wednesday next week I don't can't
 
02:37:25.230 --> 02:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
tell you exactly what that'll be yet it
 
02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
probably be a combination of work
 
02:37:30.309 --> 02:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
session public hearing and U possibly
 
02:37:33.910 --> 02:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
EXA just one day um I don't know yet
 
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
because it kind of depends what happens
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:41.790 --> 02:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
so what's
 
02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:44.269 align:start position:0%
so what's
that

02:37:44.269 --> 02:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
I've been kind of sticking with 10 I
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
mean I but you know that's subject to
 
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
change until this goes in tomorrow but
 
02:37:56.590 --> 02:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be any earlier than 9:30 do
 
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:06.990 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:38:06.990 --> 02:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:08.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
um okay so you'd rather start at 10: on
 
02:38:13.349 --> 02:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
Tuesday for that reason okay yeah I knew
 
02:38:15.790 --> 02:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
there was something okay so it's
 
02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
Wednesday that potentially could start
 
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
at 9:30 if we have U if we have a need
 
02:38:25.870 --> 02:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
for that all right that's all I have any
 
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's no questions then we will see
 
02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:39.030 align:start position:0%
there's no questions then we will see
you

02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow
