over when you're when you get my age you
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%

uh well wait a minute before I sorry
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
little bit of uh what how a work session
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
differs from a normal session a work
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
session is much more informal uh it's
 
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.869 align:start position:0%
session is much more informal uh it's
it's

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
discussion uh I'll recognize uh I'll try
 
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
to recognize as many people I will qu
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
questions don't have to come through the
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh I I'm a lot
 
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.430 align:start position:0%
chair uh I I'm a lot
more

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh Lucy lot more informal
 
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
yeah you even didn't even wear a tie so
 
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh with that why don't we uh start with
 
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
the just start with the first one the
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
easiest one uh House Bill 186 and uh
 
00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
Veil good morning um and thank you uh Mr
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
chair I spoke with the sponsor of the
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
bill yesterday at length and um so
 
00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:30.919 align:start position:0%
in House Bill
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
186 this bill was filed um The graft and
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
taxpayers were paying 25% of their
 
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
County budget um secondary to a
 
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
relationship with the sewer company that
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
has been really difficult um we we heard
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
the bill we heard there were many flaws
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
with the bill and people brought out
 
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
some that are substantial that
 
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
would help us to realize that this bill
 
00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
needs a lot of work no one has um
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
stepped up to do that work and get those
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
amendment in and uh the sponsors weren't
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
able to get that done and would like the
 
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring this back having
 
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
considered all of the feedback and the
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
responses and Impressions that they got
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
chair so is uh What uh what is he
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
looking to uh he wants to be able to
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
come back so he wants us to itl it yes
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
that's what we could do and if if
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
um when we do the executive session um
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's the plan we will itl the bill and
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
they will be able to re re examine the
 
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
situation and see what can come further
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
for a better Bill
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay by the way there is uh we this is a
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
this is a work session we are not going
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
to exec anything we're just just going
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
to be find out where we stand and uh if
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
there what is we feel as a uh as a
 
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
committee needs uh we we need additional
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
information to make a final judgment so
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
there will be no exing today uh
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
so that is there anybody who has any
 
00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959 align:start position:0%
questions or uh any uh any thoughts on
 
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
how we might proceed do you have do you
 
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
so I think I'll just look for a
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
consensus uh that when we come
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
back uh and I'm looking at maybe the 1
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
of November or an executive session on
 
00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
these on the bills that we have to uh
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
that there's no additional work on on
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
necessary on this bill and we all are
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
ready to uh make a a decision
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
and uh just I'll just look for a
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
consensus that will be look will we be
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about an
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
itl generally
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
and I won't bother taking a vote on it I
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
just uh let the record show that uh this
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
the uh these all seem to be in a
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
consensus and there's no additional
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
information needed uh why don't we move
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
on to uh House Bill
 
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
194 uh relative to requiring the
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
director of the division of archives and
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
Records management to compile and
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
maintain a list of
 
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.870 align:start position:0%
maintain a list of
public

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
monuments the uh I
 
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
recall uh
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
this when we last had this bill
 
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh we we were split the committee was
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
split down the middle on uh uh on uh on
 
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.310 align:start position:0%
split down the middle on uh uh on uh on
passing

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
passing
 
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
or we were we're 10 to 10 on the bill
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
for on to to approve it to pass it uh
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
with that we decided to retain it
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
and because most of the concern seem to
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
be around the scope of the build and uh
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
that's really where where we uh want to
 
00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:34.389 align:start position:0%
that's really where where we uh want to
start

00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
or I mean I I'll I'll I'll kind of as
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
one of the people who voted
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh not not to
 
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
approve uh my concern was
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
that I couldn't I didn't understand the
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
scope how much
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
information we were we would have to the
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
this bill talks about and we have to be
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
processed uh
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
there there are little there's inform
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
there's we just don't know uh who where
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
the where the money would come from I
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
can't uh don't know what the uh actual
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
work product would would really be
 
00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't get uh a handle around that I
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
think that's where that's where I stand
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anybody else wish to
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
speak about it
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair um I I
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
maybe we could hear from the agency
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative because it it looks like
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
um new hampshire. goov already has a
 
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
website the list of markers I'm looking
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
at right now and so I I don't see
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
why was there a problem that this bill
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
is seeking to um remedy uh I don't think
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
I we ever had that clear so um we could
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
hear about that that would be good thank
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.189 align:start position:0%

that it was really helpful for high
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
to um either know more about their state
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
but also then they could do do um their
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
own trips or you know go to those places
 
00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:05.759 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so it made sense to
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
me that it'd be something we should do
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I and I feel like we'd heard from
 
00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:11.759 align:start position:0%
the administrator who would take this on
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
that um he would be able to uh do this
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
work without too much trouble so it
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
seemed to me like it um it would help
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
our help our young people and wouldn't
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
be a ton of extra work I I think because
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
they have a website already and it would
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
be adding to it and it's actually not as
 
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:34.519 align:start position:0%
complicated as it sounds or as timec
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
consuming maybe um so I would love to
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
hear if that is still the case from it
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
looks like the sponsor has worked on
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
some new language to see how that new
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
language came about I'd love to hear
 
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:49.959 align:start position:0%
that thanks repres representative
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
Brun just to give some history on this
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
bill I remember seeing it um come before
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
us says the LSR it was from freshman rep
 
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative gero jamana from Keen
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative Jana is a history
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
professor at Keen state college so I
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
look at this as something that if he
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
thinks it's important it is um but the
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
flaw with the bill as it was originally
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
submitted is that it delegated this um
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the department uh the
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
division of archives and Records
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
management and I at that time I called
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
representative jamao and Jama and I said
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
I think this is more appropriate to go
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
with the division of historical and
 
00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
cultural resources which we already have
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
in place and I talked to Ben Wilson this
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
is back probably a year ago and he said
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
oh yeah this is something we could
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
easily do we interact with town and City
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
historical societies anyway we could
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
compile this information and once every
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
10 years just circle back with them and
 
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
make sure if there's any new markers or
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
new monuments we could and compile them
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
um and after that conversation he said
 
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
that there would be no fiscal note that
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
we already have this um because when it
 
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
came with the fiscal note initially it
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
was because it was going to a department
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
that didn't already have this
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility so it's going to the
 
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate division at no extra costs
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
every 10 years they have to compile this
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
list to make it publicly available um
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
there are many things the state can miss
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
from their website because it may be
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
held by a local local Historical Society
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
I know that in miramac we have really
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
fostered um our historical society and I
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
don't think it would really come to
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
their mind to submit that to division of
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
historical resources so I think having a
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
system in here where every 10 years that
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
can be reviewed would be a positive for
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
our state and not just for our students
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
but I think all members of the public
 
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
would appreciate knowing that historical
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
richness of our state and this would be
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
a One-Stop shop to get those kinds that
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
kind of information so I I support the
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
bill as
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
amended where it goes into the
 
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.870 align:start position:0%
amended where it goes into the
appropriate

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
Department any other anoun on
 
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.470 align:start position:0%
Department any other anoun on
representative

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
gold I think that's a good point that uh
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know if there's no cost that was my
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
concern seemed like a big cost for this
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
but with another division taking care of
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
it that sounds good and I was thinking
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
maybe the kids wouldn't be going to
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
these volums but you know how people go
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
to um covered bridges and things like
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
that maybe they could add going to The
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
Monuments but if there's no cost and
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
it's in the division that can do it for
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
free I don't see why can be done I think
 
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
we have to discuss costs that's was one
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the one of the issues when we uh uh
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
when we first saw this bill okay so that
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
I think is going to to be part of our
 
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.510 align:start position:0%
I think is going to to be part of our
discussion

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
because okay let is repres
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns is this physical
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
markers would it
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
include Town
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
boundaries the reason I ask is that
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
towns are required to do
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
perambulations uh every seven years uh
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
where they're supposed to go around and
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
verified their property lines uh which
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
are usually mocked by a strange set of
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
boundaries for example in Farmington we
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
have a point where there's a pile of
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
rocks with initials on it where Five
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
Towns come together only place in the
 
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
state that happens a few yards in one of
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
the markers is a big boulder and this is
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
how it's defined in the in the records
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh from 18 something uh big boulder four
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
rocks on top lift the rocks and there's
 
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.310 align:start position:0%
rocks on top lift the rocks and there's
a

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
date this is how it's described that's
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for and I can tell
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
you as of a couple of years ago that's
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
there would that be something that would
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
be included in physical markers and have
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
the towns actually done the uh the every
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
sevene check of their boundaries I'm not
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
sure about that see that is not of
 
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.750 align:start position:0%
sure about that see that is not of
itself

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.310 align:start position:0%
itself
see

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe I shouldn't respond to that
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
but that's a
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
question that is a question of the bill
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
is the spe specificity around what
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
you're actually going to be including in
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
the in the data and how
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
many how many points of data are we
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
talking 10 100 there's 22 was it
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
221 towns 10 counties 13 cities and 25
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
unincorporated areas in the state of New
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if all if every one of them
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
puts in 10 the 10 10 monuments and I
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
know there's just 10 monuments within
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
within within 300 feet of this of this
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
room uh what there could be the heck of
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of data and I think we have to
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
Veil thank you Mr chair um I just think
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is a really powerful way to
 
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
keep history alive in New Hampshire and
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
also that it's um important because it
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
brings the study of history and the
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge of history in
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the state which we know
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
is very valuable and we always try to
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
preserve um outside the classroom where
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
everyone has access and I I really
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
support this kind of database what I
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
know about software is that once you get
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
the program running it really doesn't
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
matter how much data that you are
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
putting into it except for the the fact
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
that you may have technological
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
limitations so I have full faith that
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
this can be done um and it can be done
 
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.549 align:start position:0%
this can be done um and it can be done
in

00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
expensively if it's if there's any
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
expense thank you anyone who has spoken
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
you oh I'm sorry I didn't
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
see Mr chair I just have a concerns
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
about the word all it says all monuments
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
all I mean who who holds people
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
accountable for every single Monument I
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
mean is I think it's a great idea I
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
think it's a great um asset it will be a
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
great asset to us but when we start with
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
all I'm not sure how that's regulated or
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
how that works it's an overwhelming word
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
to me that's very good
 
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.070 align:start position:0%
to me that's very good
point

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
representative uh is someone else no oh
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
representative har for first for our
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
first time thank you Mr chair um I also
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
have concerns about the extent and the
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
definitions of what will be um
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
accumulated by the division of
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
historical resources and I certainly
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
would like to see a letter or something
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
from them confirming there's no
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
additional cost because I find that a
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
little hard to believe that there's not
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
some cost to it um so the fiscal note
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear from the historical
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
resources maybe they can tweak what
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
they're already doing
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe limit um somewhat or Define
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
what they would want to categorize thank
 
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.510 align:start position:0%
what they would want to categorize thank
you

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
time har bull for a second for a second
 
00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
time thank you for your Indulgence um I
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
I agree with my colleague down there
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
about some of the language and and I'm
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know just to just to reiterate I'm
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
perfectly I think this a great
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
program and I think the wayf finding and
 
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
the markers and having a list of the
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
markers is definitely worthwhile as I
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
said there is already somebody is
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
already doing it I'd like to so if you
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
go on the website it says um there's the
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
list of the markers and it says that uh
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
that somebody is is there's a highway
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
marker program and it's administered by
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh Amy Dixon um in coordination with the
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
do it's called the historic Highway
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
marker program it says it's jointly
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
managed by the New Hampshire division of
 
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
historical resources and New Hampshire
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation am I to I just have a
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
question am I to understand that they no
 
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
longer want to administer this it what's
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
going on with the transfer because
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
clearly it's already being administered
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
and managed managed formally and we
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from those people so I
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
think it would be worthwhile to kind of
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
reach out and see what's going on as far
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
you reprentative Simpson for a second
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
time thank you um so it's my
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that that list is only
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
Highway markers though and doesn't
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
include monuments so I'm not sure um if
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's a list of monuments
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
um already on that site but my my
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
feeling is
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
administratively that it would be a way
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
to have all the monuments in the same
 
00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
way that this that the highway markers
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
are um but my uh I would like to ask the
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor if we can talk to him in a
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
minute I I think that's a great question
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
to ask him um but the other thing I
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to say is that I don't get the
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
feeling that this bill is in any way
 
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
meant to be be punitive there are no um
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
there are no sort of consequences
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
written into the bill if somebody were
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
to miss a monument in terms of all
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
monuments I think a I think that um it's
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
not necessarily if if your Historical
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
Society were to forget to add a monument
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
in a in a conversation with the cultural
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
resource's office I don't think that
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
somebody would be punished for that I
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
think it's a a good faith attempt to
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that every 10 years we would
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
update the list to show to reflect any
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
new monuments um I'm just sort of
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
imagining how that works administrative
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
I I didn't take that to be I didn't take
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
that to be punitive I just talk took it
 
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
as what you know what's what does this
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
what does this Encompass there I mean we
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
call gravestones
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
monuments uh and I don't know if that uh
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
does this
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
cover cemeteries uh things like things
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
like that there's all there's so much
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
you could put into something like this
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
especially if the the we because his
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
history by itself is Broad you'd like to
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
be able to get all information and what
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
information are you going to put into
 
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
this uh that's yeah representative ghoul
 
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
for a second you could even add the
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
railroad markers along the rail
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
as you say we don't know what this
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
encompasses there are markers along the
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
so representative Darby for the first
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
start thank thank you Mr chair just I
 
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
mean just reading the amendment um in
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
particular because I think that's that's
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
really where the clarity is it does say
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
maintained by state and local
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
authorities so it's it's not it's not as
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
broad as we're we're talking about here
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's the it's um the set that um you
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
know municipalities and the state is
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
already responsible for and so they can
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
reach right out to these municipalities
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's not wandering around the fields and
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
things like
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
that response to that I just heard
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
historical societies well they're not
 
00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
part of the towns or the well I'm
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
telling say what the amendment says the
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
amendment says um exactly so you're not
 
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
going to do put historical
 
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
societies I mean I would put his IAL
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
sociey in there myself we're doing I
 
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
know it's that that's kind of the that's
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
kind thing really why we're here is the
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's fine but I just I I just was
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
thinking that we could scope it to
 
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
what's in this amendment yeah okay we
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
could do that but we we'll again
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
we'll what be because uh we're well
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
let's see how far we get today but I I
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
think uh uh we probably might want to
 
00:28:56.679 --> 00:28:58.350 align:start position:0%
think uh uh we probably might want to
consider

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh I've been been considering it and I I
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
can do it establish a uh a subcommittee
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
to spend additional time and try to try
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
to rework the bill if it's
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
possible uh anyone else from the on the
 
00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:17.590 align:start position:0%
possible uh anyone else from the on the
committee

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
with for the first time was that um it
 
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
seems to me that it's not a big ask of a
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
division of historical
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
resources to do an inventory every 10
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
years um mean what else does the
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
division do
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
except to to do this kind of work and I
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
think the big component is to include um
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
the Outreach to Educators in the state
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
every 10 years to let them know what's
 
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.430 align:start position:0%
every 10 years to let them know what's
out

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
there so I don't see why it seems that
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
division representative rung for the
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative L Montaine
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
echoed what I was going to say we have a
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources what
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
are they doing if they're not compiling
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
a list of our historical resources but
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're going around and around and I know
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
that the director wasn't able to be here
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
today but I know he's going to be
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
available next week is this something
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
that we can put on agenda for next week
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
because it seems like all of our
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
questions are ones that he can be the he
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
can answer have someone from
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
the you are here for the for to talk
 
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.669 align:start position:0%
the you are here for the for to talk
about

about
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
huh oh okay okay okay so you're not okay
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
I I
 
00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:50.590 align:start position:0%
I I
misunderstood

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstood
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
yes but uh we we could uh well again
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
talk about a uh putting a subcommittee
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
together to be able to really Bor borrow
 
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
down into this
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
and representative Darby and then I'm
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%

00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
that under the Department of Natural and
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
historic sites and there is a chief
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the bureau um for these so

La montin was saying you know we could
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
speak to that uh Chief supervisor we
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
could understand the um the definition
 
00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
of uh how he would interpret how they
 
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry how they would interpret uh
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
these monuments being maintained by
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
state and local authorities and the
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
impact of uh of accumulating these once
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
every 10 years and that's uh EST
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
a10d I'm seeing no one else with a
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%

uh I know is there anyone else who is
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%

if it doesn't operate we can we have a
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
so said should I ask him to sit in uh
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%

summarizing

00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
summarizing
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh I want to
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
thank representative rung for
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
summarizing the history of how this bill
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
came to be I was a brand new legislator
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
when I introduced it uh and not knowing
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
which departments were appropriate I'm a
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
historian so to me I think archives
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
right and so that's kind of where my
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
mind went but fortunately with some help
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
from representative rung uh and some
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
others kind of made the right
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
connections and and ended up speaking
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
with Ben Wilson about uh you this
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
fitting appropriately in in what the
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
Department of uh historical and cultural
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
resources does I also want to uh thank
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative veale for for her
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
comments in particular about the idea of
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
of keeping history alive that's
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
obviously something I care a great deal
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
about I think probably all of us do uh
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know monuments are very often in our
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
towns things we pass by every day
 
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
without really reflecting on them right
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
and one of my interests as a historian
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
is you know how we can make history
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
something which we engage with regularly
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
and and and think about especially in a
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
a state with uh such a long and great
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
history as as New
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I also have have learned in
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
my first term as a rep and I I think I
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
understand why right we don't like to
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
have days for particular people or
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
particular events right you know those
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
kind of have the governor make a
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
proclamation and um uh and I understand
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
that and and you know some folks from my
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
part of the state for example we wanted
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
to have a granny D Day right that was
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that we voted on I
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
understand the the reasons for not
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
wanting to to have all of these days but
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
one of the responses that we often hear
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
which I think is a valid one is well
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
look that should be kind of done at the
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
local level right so if you want to
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
celebrate granny D it would be a lot
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
more meaningful to have a celebration in
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
chesher County she was from
 
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
Peterboro or to have a marker of some
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
kind in chesher County right that that
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
would actually be a lot more meaningful
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
than a Proclamation signed by the
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
governor I completely agree with that so
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this bill would
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
do would be
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
through specifically through schools I'm
 
00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
thinking about middle school high school
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
but I also think through historical
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
societies is hopefully kind of generate
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
conversations I would absolutely love to
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
have a group of middle school or high
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
school students have history projects
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
for their County or their their Town
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
based on uh the the markers that are out
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
there and to say well who could we add a
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
marker to right so somebody like granny
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
d and if you had students who then went
 
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
to town hall or came here and made an
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
argument about why a certain person is
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
worthy of having a monument or a marker
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh in their town so that that was part
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
of my thinking about how this could fit
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
in particular we're also talking a lot
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
about Civics education right a new
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
Civics textbook that we're helping to
 
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
fund to me it goes hand inand teaching
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
local history with our students with our
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
objective in terms of a a more robust
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
Civics education
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
I do think that a lot of the questions
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
that you've asked regarding the work of
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
the department absolutely Ben Wilson uh
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
director Wilson is the best person to be
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
able to answer those questions I can
 
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
tell you that I drafted the wording that
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
is in the amendment with director Wilson
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
right so uh all of the for example as as
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative Darby pointed out
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
specifically focusing on that word
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
maintain by local or state authorities
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
right so the mile markers that's already
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
there right because it's maintained by
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
the state the state already has that but
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
a locality will have a list of
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
maintained markers um and in terms of
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
whether you're talking about working
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
with the the the local government or
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
historical societies again at the
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
direction of of the director that was
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
left vague because it was not to kind of
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
prescribe to them the manner in which
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
they would work with Folks at the local
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
level in order to get that information
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
right so it it was intentionally not to
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
name specific groups that they would
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
work with as I said at the director's
 
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
request because again they have those
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
relationships already uh and this allows
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
them more flexibility in terms of of
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
information so those are my uh
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
initial uh thoughts in response to some
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
of the thoughtful questions you all have
 
00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:57.309 align:start position:0%
of the thoughtful questions you all have
asked

00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of again the expense
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
obviously the director is the person to
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
answer that question when I spoke with
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
him about this again he said he used the
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
the mile Highway mile marker as a good
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
example he said look this is what we
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
want to do we are actually actively
 
00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
trying to uh reflect on our state's
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
history and our cultural heritage and
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
have that represented uh and he s sees
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
this and again he can speak to but then
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
maybe if he speaks to a subcommittee he
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
sees this as going hand inand with what
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
they are doing right so that that mile
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
marker program is part of a proactive
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
program by the department to do exactly
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
what I hoping that this bill will
 
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
accomplish and so he sees it working
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
with the work the the department is
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
history

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
REO he rebooted okay good all right uh
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
just couple of things that that jumped
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
this we have a whole lot of now there do
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
you talk about mile markers are you
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
referring to the signs that say uh this
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
is the birth that that we they put up
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
this that actually
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh repres director
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
Wilson's uh area uh his uh his
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
department is is responsible for the
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
business of the the signs that uh here
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
on this this is the birthplace of so and
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
so it was it was recently in in the in
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
the news concerning the the Communist
 
00:40:57.839 --> 00:40:58.630 align:start position:0%
the news concerning the the Communist
who

00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
was put the her uh
 
00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
that uh that sign was was later taken
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
down I think uh but it's that kind of
 
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
thing these are all over the state is
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
that what what he mean by markers or is
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
that me mile marker is yes I apologize I
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
should not have used the word mile
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
markers they are historical markers
 
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
along their Highway markers but correct
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
I misspoke when I said mile markers okay
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
I mean there's one right in front of the
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
front of the the uh the several yeah the
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh the libraries are different markers I
 
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.150 align:start position:0%
uh the libraries are different markers I
prefer

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
historical and so you're looking for
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
stuff like that how
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
monuments Civil War
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
monuments uh Hall of flags has uh as are
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
all kinds of markers we
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
have markers of of plaques of throughout
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of the those who
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
lost their lives in the various wars
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
Civil War the especially the especially
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
World War I and World War II you have
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
you have those markers are all those
 
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.549 align:start position:0%
you have those markers are all those
considered

00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
be uh it's that's where the scope comes
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
in I I was doing some looking
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
online and uh on cannons you realize how
 
00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:34.839 align:start position:0%
many cannons there are in the state of
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I know the in nasua they
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
they've got three around the uh the the
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
monument the the Civil War Monument that
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
big tall thing at the top of Library
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
Hill yeah top of Library Hill there's
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
three there's not only there's three
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
there there's also from World War I
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
there's a German Howitzer later on in
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
the park so I of from World War I all of
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
those I would assume are monuments you'd
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
be surprised there are
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
tanks that are monuments that in front
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
of the V various vfw's are they going to
 
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.549 align:start position:0%
of the V various vfw's are they going to
be

00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
part yeah if I may first of all I would
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
say that if they are maintained by local
 
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
authorities first of all uh there was
 
00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:21.079 align:start position:0%
somebody in that town who already has a
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
list because they are being maintained
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
so it's a matter of a list which is
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
being sent from from local authority to
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of historical and
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
cultural resources and then put on a
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
website but I would also say uh Mr chair
 
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
that the examples that you just gave are
 
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
a great example everybody should know
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state should know what
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
those monuments are that they're there
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
right I mean how many monuments do we
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
know in our own towns because we live
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
there and we don't know the richness of
 
00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:49.559 align:start position:0%
the state's history because we don't
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
know much of anything about monuments in
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
other parts of the state that are part
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
of our our history so I would argue that
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
the examples you just gave are actually
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
an argument in favor of this bill
 
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
because everyone should know they're
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
there I I don't I don't disagree I
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
mean I I love history I I got got a
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
website here that's artill artillery and
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
armor in the USA New Hampshire so it's
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
got and if if you want to know which if
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
you tell me your town I'll tell you
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
which guns are in
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.910 align:start position:0%
which guns are in
it

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
mortars so that's I mean Bristol in the
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
Amherst and all so there and there there
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
is history all over and I don't but it's
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
the the scope of what we're talking
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
about is what I'm concerned with because
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have my hands around it and we
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
talk about dealing with the
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
locals it it's one thing if we get into
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
that the there is such a thing as 91a if
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
we ask for it we got to pay for
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
it so they have to be a we have to get
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
worked into the bill
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
that it's the information that that you
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
receive you you it's they're giving it
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
to to uh to the state they're not giving
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
it to us at the demand of the
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
state because once you ask for if you
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
say you got to we need this at this data
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
they'll say okay it's going to cost us
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
this amount of money to be able to go
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
and check stuff out
 
00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's one of the issues the
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
other issue I think uh is getting data
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
into the this say about we do this once
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
every 10 years do you just accumulate
 
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.910 align:start position:0%
every 10 years do you just accumulate
the

00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
stuff new any new stuff or do you just
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
send out a call and it's say okay one
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
year get it all in and if you don't get
 
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.470 align:start position:0%
year get it all in and if you don't get
it

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
in well see it 10 years from now well
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
could could I speak to that well I
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
imagine and again the director would be
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
the the best person to ask about that
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
but exactly so what I imagine would
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
happen is right every nine years right
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
or so every 10 years right the uh the
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
department would send out this request
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
to the local authorities with whom they
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
have relationships and basically then
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's updating the list right I mean
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
there's at that point there the amount
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
of work that would be done to update a
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
list after its initial creation would be
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
minimal because a locality would only be
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
reporting if any new monuments had been
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh placed uh during that period of 10
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
years so the maintenance of the list
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
would be really really minimal
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
and finally they let it go ask others to
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
to ask their
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
questions I and if if uh Mr Mr Wilson
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
were here it' be aimed at him but you're
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
here so uh
 
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's and I think it was
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh why don't I
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
just what
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
what would the what would the the quote
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
List look like would it be a database
 
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
where you have and how much information
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
will be put into this
 
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
list uh it it it it's it's one thing if
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're making a Excel spreadsheet and
 
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
that's it and you got couple you know
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
one sentence and and this is what it is
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
and forget about it or do you have some
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
kind of database which
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
you look I do do you envision the type
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
of where somebody could click on well I
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
want to see what this looks like and
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
boom it takes you to a to another file
 
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
that file comes up and says this is what
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
this this this is that's that's a really
 
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
a research tool other than that um it's
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
more the list is just a
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
list so but anyway that's my uh
 
00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.829 align:start position:0%
list so but anyway that's my uh
representative

00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you Mr chair um yeah I think
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
I i' point to DN uh the division of
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
flest and lands keeps a list of rare
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
plant species they have to mandate
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
they're mandated to to track it every
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
five years that that list I mean that's
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
just an Excel spreadsheet i' assume
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
something like that would be appropriate
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
um and it is just a Excel spreadsheet
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
but you can look up your town and watch
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
for airplants are there and all that
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
information if yeah if I may also yeah
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
exact exactly I mean for for the
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
purposes of this bill uh it it is just
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
keeping that kind of list uh for the
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
state and and you know if if the
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
department had the resources and the
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
time to be able to make it a research
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
tool as as you were just describing I
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
think that would be great but I also
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
think it's unlikely uh so in this case
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
it is the purpose of the list is to make
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
all of that information publicly
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
available again I I return to the the
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
the good examples uh that that you gave
 
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago right so that having I
 
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
I would say a list is not just a list a
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
list indicates to people that something
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
is there that they may not have known
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
was there uh and that I think can have
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
tremendous value for you know teachers
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
and schools particularly again around
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
Civics and New Hampshire history so yes
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
I I Envision it as being simply a a list
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
comparable to what is currently uh
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
online as representative Harvey bolia
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
pointed out with regard to the uh
 
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
Highway way markers um that is
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
accessible in a similar kind of format
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
but uh that's the best I can can answer
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
that question and certainly uh the
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
depth would you consider um including
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.230 align:start position:0%
depth would you consider um including
cemeteries

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
cemeteries
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
um it seems there are a lot of uh old
 
00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:31.799 align:start position:0%
cemeteries that may have started out as
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
private or family cemeteries that are
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
abandoned but eventually they can be
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
taken over by the city or town um and
 
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:42.799 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
included yeah thank you for that
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
question I know cemeteries came up
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
earlier um and we actually we have some
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
of our students in Keen State too who do
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
research um on local history using
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
cemeteries in in the Reg
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
and again uh we already have processes
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
right whereby cemeteries can be um uh
 
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
searching for the right word for this
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
but can be acknowledged to have
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
historical significance right and we
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
have probably all of us in our towns
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
historic cemeteries uh and they have uh
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
they're recognized by towns and and so
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
bottom line is you know uh not all
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
cemeteries presumably would fall into
 
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
this category but there are categories
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
that we all there are cemeteries that we
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
all have in our communities that are
 
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledged as of historic significance
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
so again I also want to emphasize that
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh and it was a point that was made by
 
00:51:39.309 --> 00:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson uh you know that
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
this obviously is not punitive but where
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
I want to go with that is to say the the
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
point is to get the best information we
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
possibly can have right so uh this
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
question about and I hear that uh there
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
was a concern about the question of all
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
monuments I'm not sure what word you
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
would substitute in in a bill right
 
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
you'd say some most uh but the point is
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
to do the best that we can do right in
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
terms of providing as comprehensive a
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
list as possible right so I don't
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
imagine that this is going to cover
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely everything that everybody
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
would regard as being of historical
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
significance and again to representative
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
Derby's Point that's why the the the
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
specific reference to maintained by
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
local or state authorities because that
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
narrows the range
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
um speaking also to the Chairman's
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about the scope that narrows
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
the scope of what we're talking about
 
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
right because without that I think we
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
are talking about well what is a
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
historical monument uh and we can get
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
into a gray area about that so
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
cemeteries I think uh that are
 
00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
acknowledged by towns as being of
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
historic significance would absolutely
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
fall into that and and towns would have
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.069 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
my question's been answered thank
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
you I just want to say thank you very
 
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
much for clearing up some information
 
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:07.470 align:start position:0%
much for clearing up some information
for

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
me okay when you talk about the
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
cemeteries um that's that's what when
 
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
the chair speaks about the scope um the
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
cemetery for Veterans Day this year we
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
went out and did the flags like we
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
always do
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
um the historical society was there and
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
the veterans were there and my wife was
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
there and she said why aren't you
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
putting flags on the the graves that
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
have G on them and they said well what's
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
g mean they Historical Society didn't
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
know veterans didn't know it's the Grand
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
Army of the Republic they were the
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
original army so are those historical
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
monuments are those all going to have to
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
be marked that's where I where I have
 
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
the problem with the scope um my wife
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
also sits on the historical society and
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
the historical Commission of
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
town they have a very hard time filling
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
those positions they're voluntary so it
 
00:54:06.789 --> 00:54:06.799 align:start position:0%
should be more voluntary for the town to
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
do these um historical commissions are
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
mandated by LSR but commissions are not
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
so when you deal with this their their
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
lists may be good they they not be
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive so there cannot be any
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
punitive if something misses that's the
 
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
big thing so you may not be get it so it
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
almost should be vol to the towns to be
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
all yeah and if I may I appreciate that
 
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
and I did not know that so thank you um
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
what I would say however is those are
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
not I am assuming publicly maintained
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
right so again that reference to public
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance limits the scope of of what
 
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about actually that
 
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
cemetery is public mainten well then
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
then it would be if it's publicly well
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
the cemetery right being publicly
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
maintained so then it is but it's not
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
publicly maintained as probably as a
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
historic site but again it depends on uh
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
the town would be the one to report that
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
right and so it would go on the list if
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
the the town reports it on the voluntary
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
side of things again because there is
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
nothing punitive
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
right in essence that's what we're
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
talking about right because the the
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
department is not going to expend a
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
great deal of Labor tracking down people
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
who don't report right and there's no
 
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism to enforce that on purpose so
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
I mean effectively it is voluntary but I
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
think we we all know even with limited
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
resources I I was on the board of our
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
Historical Society for a few
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
years I I imagine that most would be
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
really eager you know the Historical
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
Society folks are generally really
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
really eager to get this uh kind of
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
information out there but to your point
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
which I think is an excellent one
 
00:55:47.549 --> 00:55:47.559 align:start position:0%
effectively we're talking about
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
something that's voluntary because
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's no enforcement mechanism and nor
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:10.710 align:start position:0%
 
be

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
did it again uh so I'd like toh set up a
 
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.789 align:start position:0%
did it again uh so I'd like toh set up a
uh

00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:17.799 --> 00:56:19.510 align:start position:0%
uh
subcommittee

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
of I'll ask for volunteers but it's got
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%

00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
got to have for every it's got to be

possible we can agree with to be able
 
00:58:41.549 --> 00:58:41.559 align:start position:0%
to to to get the job
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
there that
 
00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
it Mr chair would it be okay to schedule
 
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee um maybe after before
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
the one we have already scheduled on the
 
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
18th uh I know that date was conveni
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
vent for Mr
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
Wilson uh what the uh 18th
 
00:59:03.069 --> 00:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
yeah uh that might not be a bad
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
idea uh but
 
00:59:06.839 --> 00:59:10.150 align:start position:0%
idea uh but
remember

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just looking
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh on that I've already uh we'll have to
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
we'll have we'll have to be at a
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
different time
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
because you are
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
you would be on this you would be on
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
both committees right now uh both
 
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
subcomittees I haven't I haven't put
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
anybody on yet but you already know I've
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
already asked you about that that's
 
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
right but we wouldn't schedule them to
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
meet all at the same time no no it's but
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
just just realize that
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
maybe uh I think that that one is
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 10
 
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.309 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 10
o'clock

00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
check I think that's yes 398 39 398 is
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
at 10
 
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.470 align:start position:0%
at 10
o'

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
o'
 
01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.990 align:start position:0%
o'
so

01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.000 align:start position:0%

18th night okay very good I'd like to
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank the chair and thank all of you for
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
conversation this
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
morning hopefully we're not as long on
 
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
the the next
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
two all
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
along hope we're not we spent almost an
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
hour on that one uh 430 434 relative to
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
flying drones and state
 
01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.750 align:start position:0%
flying drones and state
parks

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
parks
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh repres yeah why don't we I don't is
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
that is that operable
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay where did uh
 
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
we we kind of vot V well we just just
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
put this into
 
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh four no House Bill
 
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.109 align:start position:0%
uh four no House Bill
434

01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
434
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
I think we the uh the there's amendment
 
01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
that I guess is coming
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
forward uh could uh you wish to speak to
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh for the record representative Lisa
 
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
post from lineboro uh thank you for um
 
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
letting me speak this morning uh this is
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
um an amendment to HB
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
434 um we removed some
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
language and what we did that made a
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
significant difference is um line 16 and
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
17 which allows the commissioner to
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
adopt rules under 541a to implement the
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
restrictions in paragraph 1 any other
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
limitations on drone use and state parks
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
and criteria to wave any of these
 
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions so this will will allow the
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
parks to set the boundaries um instead
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
of us you know asking for something
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
specifically um and I think that would
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
make it easier to work with the um the
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
parks department to get it done with
 
01:03:15.549 --> 01:03:15.559 align:start position:0%
that language um and we already have
 
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions on there so um we're
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
willing to take some of those
 
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions that and work with them to
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
get this done
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
it in our state parks is there someone
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
from the uh parks department
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
all have they been uh have they been
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
provided a copy of this
 
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment this proposed
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
amendment so the the parks no not not at
 
01:03:56.269 --> 01:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
this time we we just got this done so um
 
01:03:59.230 --> 01:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
kind of late late uh to the game on it
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
but we were just trying to come up with
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
some um uh Solutions um because we were
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
kind of at a standstill with the parks
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
department um the last time we spoke
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
with them so uh this is to you know try
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
to get this through um with the
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
cooperation of the parks department um I
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
in looking up um some other
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh states that have done this um
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
California if you look at California
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
they do it in the Parks and uh at the
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
beaches and um they have many um many
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
areas that they can go to and they have
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions on them in some things and
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
there is also local control in towns um
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
so they have the ability to do that so
 
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
so some of the rules that you know we
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
could put on this working with the parks
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
department um would provide um
 
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
assurances that people aren't um you
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
know surveilling other people and things
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
like that and um California has um some
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
really good restrictions that we could
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
use as a basis for um you know putting
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
in there any questions uh representative
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
ghoul I think I was still during the
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
original hearing but my question is some
 
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
state parks are quite large like be
 
01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
Brook for example or uh pck away and you
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
could be hiking way out away from your
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
parking lot and a drone goes by how
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
would you know who's doing that if they
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
bother you
 
01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.390 align:start position:0%
bother you
somehow

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
01:05:52.029 --> 01:05:52.039 align:start position:0%
so um I think
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
what whoops um thank you uh so what
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is establish a place
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
to launch and a a place to come back so
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
a person um would have to um with with
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions have to be in a certain
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
area right and um as we had it before
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
where it was on the trail system now
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
this is in the Parks and we're hoping
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
what we can do with this bill is to
 
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
designate certain areas and E there may
 
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
even be we could do certain times of the
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
year I mean I think there's a lot to
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
look at and unpack with this um
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
regarding rules around it to make it
 
01:06:38.359 --> 01:06:39.309 align:start position:0%
regarding rules around it to make it
safe

01:06:39.309 --> 01:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
safe
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
for people who are on the Trails um or
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
not on the trails excuse me in the state
 
01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
parks hiking and things like that so I
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
think we could work together with the
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
department and and you know try to make
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
the best
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
possible um and start allowing you know
 
01:07:00.029 --> 01:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
drones to be in certain areas and maybe
 
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
we can build on it maybe we can start
 
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
small pick certain Parks
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
think representative Ron thank you Mr
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you representative post
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
for the amendment but um I I'm looking
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
back at my notes from the public hearing
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
and um I I still see these issues
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
haven't been resolved and they were
 
01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
brought up by U Miss uh Trisha Lambert
 
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
she's with the Bureau of Aeronautics at
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
do and she had said that drones are not
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA so I don't see a
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
definition here the and that the
 
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
Aerospace is regulated by the FAA that
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
the state can't do that there is no
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for
 
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
insurance RSA 644 already covers privacy
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
and that charging for flight is a per
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
rview of the FAA can only charge for
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
takeoff and Landing but emergency
 
01:08:01.269 --> 01:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
landing should be allowed so I wish I
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
took a little more detailed notes but I
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
don't see how the the B the big thing
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
that I see with this is that um that air
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
space is regulated by FAA so how do we
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
get around that like so actually um
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
that's already in in law so we don't
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
have to worry about that because once it
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
it takes off it's in that airspace and
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
there okay so the FAA allows that they
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
do oh okay and then um it's it's just
 
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
the takeoff and the landing that's the
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
issue okay and and do you know is are
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
are drones um defined in statutes
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere other than this
 
01:08:50.349 --> 01:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
chapter well I do know I I don't know
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
for the um for our state and and perhaps
 
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
uh Drew Melman who this is um a
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
constituent bill would he be able to
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
come and address
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
that when now her question oh
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah this is that this is an an
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
open this type of hearing uh work
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
session anyone is can speak yeah I'm not
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
aware of where it's def find in statute
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
but I know there was uh some work that
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
was done on that within the past couple
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
years I don't know if it actually got
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
passed um as far
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
as I'm sorry what was the other part of
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
the question uh it was really about the
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
definition I know we've worked on
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
several watercraft bills over the years
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
and it is important to Define because
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
they may come out with a drone next year
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's monstrous and maybe but if if we
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't Define like the size and the um
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
mechanics of the
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
Drone anything could then be defined by
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
a as and and be called a drone and be
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
put in so I think it is good having a
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
definition of what we are regulating
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
here what we are allowing whatever that
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
definition would be would mimic
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
something that's already in place in the
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
fars Federal Aviation regulations and
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
they do have a definition of of what
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
that would be um so if we do have a
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
definition adopted we would probably
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
mimic what's already in place for
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
federal law and then you also had a
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
point about um this bill having maybe
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
overlap with federal laws and Trisha
 
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
Lambert's concerned with that in this
 
01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
amend we actually took out um some
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
mention of the flight aspect and this
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill right now as it stands only deals
 
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
with takeoff and landing and that's
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
something really only under our our
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
prview that's the only thing we can
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
regulate okay that sounds good I I would
 
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
like to um try and get a definition in
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
you know or have this this um Bill
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
reference a definition in New Hampshire
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
statutes so it doesn't leave it
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
open-ended so not anybody can Define it
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
statute and I just want to mention um
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
doing some lookup while I was in the
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
back there um there are new drone laws
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
in um the United States now and looking
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
through these I can send them all to to
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
you so it's it's actually kind of
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
informative but it's also inclusive of
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
drone use okay thank you yeah and they
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair just um just to
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Rong um she
 
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
did specifically say to use the
 
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
definitions in RSA 422 that's what she's
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
recommended not drone so that's what um
 
01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
if to to get Mr Lambert's uh you know to
 
01:11:49.229 --> 01:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
align with what Miss Lambert was
 
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting I would look at the
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
definitions in RSA 422 and I do think
 
01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
that there are still a couple of wording
 
01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
challenges here in terms of you know for
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
example in um where's the use here yeah
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
so line 17 it says limitations on drone
 
01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
use in state parks you know I think you
 
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
really want to limit that to take off in
 
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
Landings explicitly like you like you're
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
suggesting um and the
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah and I and I there's one other
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
small tweak which is that the
 
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
um the existing um I on page two at line
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
one it said the commissioner shall adopt
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
rules only for the uh assessment and
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
payment of fees and that sort of
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
contradicts the new Clause that you put
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
in about adopting rules so I think
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
there and she also is excuse me that is
 
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
actually for the commercial use we're
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
only looking at Hobby use um I'm I'm
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
amendment oh if you're talking about RSA
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
422 so this is um RSA 541a only for the
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
assessment and payment of fees for
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
operators of small unmanned aircraft for
 
01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.430 align:start position:0%
operators of small unmanned aircraft for
commercial

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
purposes okay but um it the the problem
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
I had is it says shall adopt rules only
 
01:13:27.629 --> 01:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
so that seemed to contradict the um
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
Clause to which said shall be able to
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
adopt rules to implement the
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions yeah I'll check on that
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
like I think if you just get rid of only
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
there that'd be fine
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
you and and she did just um as a
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
reminder the insurance thing also came
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
up from Miss Lambert so I think there's
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
a a piece there that needs to be
 
01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.350 align:start position:0%
a a piece there that needs to be
reconciled

01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
reconciled
 
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.590 align:start position:0%
reconciled
thanks

01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
the insurance requirement is not
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
something I'm aware of in other states
 
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:06.679 align:start position:0%
requirement representative done that's
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
actually one of my questions is who is
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
responsible is the state responsible if
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
somebody comes on the property and one
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
of these drones hits somebody that's
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
hiking who has the
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility if someone's
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
injured um as far as violations of
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
airspace rules that would have to go to
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
the FAA so there's a whole um reporting
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
procedure that state parks would have to
 
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
go through and local police are doing
 
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
this already um they would have to
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
report incidences to the the FAA but if
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
there is property damage or damage to
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
the state parks on the grounds then then
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
there is some some overlap how much of a
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
burden is that going to put on the state
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
parks right now if they have to report
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
all these
 
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
incidents and I don't know if you could
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
put a a number on that but like you
 
01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
already do have the ability to fly in
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
the airace above state parks that's
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
something that's currently permitted and
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
um this perhaps puts in processes in
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
place to help Streamlight that and um
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
have a better capability of dealing with
 
01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
situations and also just
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
um to confirm that um you can you can
 
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
stand at the edge of a road on the
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
outside of the park right and you can
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
set you know launch and and land the
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
Drone there um so those things already
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
happen um this is to give people a safe
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
area to be in and be able to you know
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
use some of the beauty of you know our
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire resources and and take
 
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
pictures and use them for many different
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
things but it's more as a hobby than
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
um the commercial use so that's the
 
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
distinction between the two um with
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
where the rules get set up for um
 
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
hobbyists as opposed to there's already
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
commercial um laws in place for that I
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
was just concerned about the liability
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
like if we if we say they're they're
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
allowed in this Zone and somebody gets
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
hurt in that zone with a drone is the
 
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.350 align:start position:0%
hurt in that zone with a drone is the
state

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
responsible question I believe that's
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
already in the bill like there is a
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
clause somewhere in here about um
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
assuming all liability for the
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
went I see that so does the state have a
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
vetting process for the insurance
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
because what if the person doesn't have
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
insurance I mean that's just not a
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
common requirement most people don't
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
carry insurance for this type of stuff I
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
mean it would um just we don't require
 
01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
insurance for driving a car a vehicle um
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
and this is recreational use you you
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
could a you know children 17 year olds
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
my my nephew
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
flies this
 
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh these these uh unmanned aerial
 
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
aircraft so I I believe the technical
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
term that representative post is looking
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
for his recreational use um and I I
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
think it's uh worth looking at this bill
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit more closely and seeing if
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
we can get something that's uh um still
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
has a lot of restrictions when it's you
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
know as it's new and we'll look at
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
California and uh and see if we can
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
start small maybe
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
and and test it out yeah uh the state
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
would not be liable for any of this it's
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
just like it's just like anything else
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
um if you're driving a bike in the the
 
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
park or uh had any other sort of
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
accident on the state park there's
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I still have the
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
same concern concerns that I had when we
 
01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
heard the bill
 
01:18:05.719 --> 01:18:07.310 align:start position:0%
heard the bill
originally

01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
um some of them have already been
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
covered drones not being defined as
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
drones I mean they're unmanned vehicles
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
and we were told that we need to use the
 
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.910 align:start position:0%
and we were told that we need to use the
right

01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
terminology but I'm wondering like we
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
have unmanned state Parks they're not
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
manned all year round who's handing out
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
waivers that say that the state's not
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
responsible if you hit somebody with
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
your drone um and I think yeah you're in
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
federal airspace right up until you
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
impact something or somebody so we're
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
asking you know we're asking the person
 
01:18:48.669 --> 01:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
who's doing this to be able to do
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
everything that they can do for their
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
drone that would make it safe but we
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
don't have a way to um leverage that
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
kind of safety like we would with an
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
insurance policy and really clear
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
outlined um really clear outlined
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
um about um sorry I was sudden it went
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
out of my head um what we want to do is
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to be sure that our
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
state parks can handle this and that the
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
people can handle this and that all of
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
the unmanned vehicle operators
 
01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
are liable and they're they they know we
 
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
make statute every day about Recreation
 
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
um recreational vehicles and we do want
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
to know what's going to happen when they
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
impact people and we really need to know
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen when something
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
goes wrong so I I think that sums up
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying in the last sentence
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's like so what happens when
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
something's goes wrong and there's just
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
so much about this that we are new to um
 
01:19:57.629 --> 01:19:57.639 align:start position:0%
but I'm continuing to look at this and
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
to see some of these ideas that we could
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
try I do think that Statute in other
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
states is a good place to look I don't
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
know if we'll find a fit for this bill
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but there's no problem
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
else um Mr
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
chair is $25 a day for commercial use of
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
Business I'm asking I don't know my
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
thought is my thought is that is just a
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
lot of money if I'm a commercial
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
photographer or um whatever you know
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
$25 I think they're going to fly every
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
single day I think they I'm uh I've I've
 
01:21:05.229 --> 01:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
actually uh got my uas at one point it's
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
expired now but um I think probably they
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
may fly for a week at a time and take
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
their photos during a season a certain
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
season or whatnot and maybe uh maybe it
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
is I'm not sure I can't answer that one
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
but just um about the Civil liability
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
again um it's the same as if you bring a
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
dog into a park that injures somebody we
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't require Insurance on your animals
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
that you bring in it's handled in small
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
claims court if there are problems but
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's also one of the reasons for the
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
permits H it's um educational and um and
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
also to to know who's in the park and in
 
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
filming but and then the third thing is
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
um and you get that um sorry I lost my
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
trying of thought with that one um you
 
01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:58.189 align:start position:0%
trying of thought with that one um you
get

01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:21:58.199 --> 01:21:59.910 align:start position:0%
get
your

01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
educational point and then um you know
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
we don't uh require people can fly
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
through the park already I mean that's
 
01:22:12.189 --> 01:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
once they're up in the air we don't
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's no way to require Insurance of
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
these people who are flying over the
 
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:19.719 align:start position:0%
park as well so it's I'm sure I know
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
people have flown in the Parks um but
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that part about the
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
Civil liability thanks maybe maybe
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative post can talk about our
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
um the uh the person who put forth the
 
01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
$25 I don't think it's too prohibitive
 
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
and I think um the original intent and
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
at least one of the original versions of
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
the bill was that you could
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
retroactively pay that $25 like let's
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
say you go flying a day and then um you
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
might end up using the pictures
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
commercially you could go back and pay
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
the $25 to the state when you actually
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
end up using the photos for commercial
 
01:23:00.159 --> 01:23:01.830 align:start position:0%
end up using the photos for commercial
purpose

01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
um there's one other thing that I lost
 
01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.629 align:start position:0%
um there's one other thing that I lost
my

01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
thought any did you get your question
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
answer representative Derby and
 
01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
representative R definitely we've heard
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
a few times here that it's already
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
permitted to fly over Parks so I'm just
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
all this would allow us to launch and
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
take off within the parks and that could
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
potentially um help alleviate some of
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
the safety concerns like instead of
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
launching from a more dangerous place
 
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
and flying miles away over to the park
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
you could be in a safer place to launch
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
and land um it would also give greater
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
access to um more interesting places to
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
fly um and one other point that I'm
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
going to make is people are doing this
 
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
already like like they're not even
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
paying attention to any of those rules
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
if you go on YouTube right now you can
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
see amazing drone videos of Crawford
 
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
Notch and um Franconia Notch State Park
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
people are doing this already so I think
 
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
it's a lot smarter if we have some rules
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
in place to better regulate that and
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
better be equipped or to be better
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
situations and i' just like to add if if
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
we put permitting on here people have to
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
fill out a form and so all their
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
information will be on there so if
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
someone gets injured we'll know who has
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
been there I'm sure we would have time
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
in timeout that type of thing so it's
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
all about putting rules in place to make
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
it safer for both people who are in the
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
Parks and for the people who are landing
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
Landing representative R thank you um
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things um
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
that concerns me still though is a
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
letter we received from um Mr Brian
 
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
Wilson from he's the uh director of the
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
division of Parks and Recreation have
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
you seen a copy of
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
that um representative did you ever
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
getet I'll get copies made this is where
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
I still have a concern though he
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
mentions in his letter and he this was
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
submitted during his testimony at the um
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing but he said we are very
 
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
concerned with the impact that bill
 
01:25:24.189 --> 01:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
would have on the recreational
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
experience of our visitors in state
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
parks campgrounds and trails including
 
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
those trails that cross private land
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
protecting the quality of that
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
experience is one of the purposes of our
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and he goes into
 
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
more detail I don't know if you if
 
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
you've seen this letter so yes that was
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
from the previous and I think that was
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
his previous testimony here as well um
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
we have had meetings with him about it
 
01:25:50.189 --> 01:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
um I thought he was sending someone here
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
today but um anyway anyway uh with that
 
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
um the fact
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
that he was talking about trails and
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
things like this this eliminates the
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
trails this is just simply in the park
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
system for a launch and
 
01:26:11.550 --> 01:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
land so that's the differentiation from
 
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
the last bill How It Was Written okay
 
01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:21.189 align:start position:0%
the last bill How It Was Written okay
thank

01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:22.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about forms and
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
documentation what about all of our
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
unman Parks who takes care of that who
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for generating those
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
forms where do they
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
go I mean I hike all the time and I
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
never see that would be the parks
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
department so if you think about it when
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
you if you want to have a fire you know
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
in the fall or sometime seasonally or
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
get a a a a permit for um the whole
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
season to be able to burn it it is the
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
same thing I think it's $2 uh they
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
charge for a seasonal um burn permit so
 
01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
questions that
 
01:27:18.109 --> 01:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
it um I noticed that you in your new
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment you took out the first um
 
01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.830 align:start position:0%
Amendment you took out the first um
exception

01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
exception
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
that um originally you had there could
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
be an exception to this if the manner of
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
a flight intentionally interferes with
 
01:27:34.109 --> 01:27:34.119 align:start position:0%
the reasonable use and enjoyment of the
 
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:37.400 align:start position:0%
park by other Park users which for
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
me I think the primary purpose of the
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
park is for people to enjoy the natural
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
world and I don't I I can see that
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
drones are in interference with that
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
and so why did you take it
 
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
out I mean I like the wording of that as
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
well but again this was going back to
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
Trisha Lambert's point about having
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
Federal overlap she actually wanted that
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
to be removed because she doesn't want
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
to have um any inkling that we're trying
 
01:28:10.109 --> 01:28:10.119 align:start position:0%
to supersede federal law and we're only
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with takeoff and Landing but I
 
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
sentiment and actually I mean the
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
enjoyment is
 
01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
putting putting restrictions on it
 
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
number one um could limit it to certain
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
months maybe that people aren't using it
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
or as much and and or you know certain
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
Parks you start with that um but again
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's someone who's as a hobbyist is
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to the parks they're using it in
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
the same way um to for
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
enjoyment to to be able to go and so um
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
the the parks everybody can have
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
 
have

01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'm if we're all done I mean we just
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
take this uh information that we have uh
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
could you uh mail me copy of this
 
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
amendment I sent it to the whole
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee okay when
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
but I do do you want me to make the
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
Amendments um from what some of the
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
things we discuss here today or any any
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that you're going to submit or
 
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
even if uh or if you're looking because
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
that we're going to eventually get the
 
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
point and uh of uh executing this
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
so you'll there will have to so there
 
01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
may be an amendment will be taken up but
 
01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
I think I would like to be able to get
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
any any Amendment that's going to be
 
01:29:58.510 --> 01:29:58.520 align:start position:0%

already discuss it but I'd like to get
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
them and amend it to this and some of
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
the changes that were suggested by
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative Darby I agree with the
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
about the the use on that line 17 and
 
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:30.040 align:start position:0%

good yes uh Trisha Lambert's behind me I
 
01:31:36.189 --> 01:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
don't know if you guys have any
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions about how drones are divined
 
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
in Statue but she'd be able to answer
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
that if she wants to speak on anything
 
01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:44.470 align:start position:0%
that if she wants to speak on anything
know

01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.950 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
was that who who would ask the question
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative Darby well I mean I um so
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
you I believe you were the one at least
 
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
according to my notes and representative
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
Run's notes that brought up the
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
insurance and brought up RSA 422 for the
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
definition of UA U's so you know I guess
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see if you still uh agree
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
language so so just I um yes I I'll
 
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
address that I just want to be clear
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
like we're just here to deal with the
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
airspace um as far as landing and
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
takeoff it's completely up to the parks
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
so just for the for the record and again
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
I'm Trisha Lambert with the Bureau of
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%

01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%

01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
in our Bureau so there is in statute
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
under 422 um um definitions for unmanned
 
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
aircrafts systems and small small s so
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
we would definitely prefer that be used
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
I think the FAA is already starting to
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
to morph into um uncrewed um so that
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
would probably need to be addressed but
 
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
the I don't I do not believe that there
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
is a definition for drone so yes that
 
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
would need to
 
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
be um changed in my opinion um to just
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
align it with those
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
definitions was there a second part to
 
01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.550 align:start position:0%
definitions was there a second part to
your

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
question um my my notes had said
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
originally that sorry while I just
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
looked this up um that you know you were
 
01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
one of the uh initial concerns you had
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
was that there was no requirement for
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
insurance and um can you speak to
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
that um so I'm not sure if I remember it
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
that way um uh maybe there was some
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
confusion but currently as it sits for
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
for for aircraft there is no requirement
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
for insurance
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm not quite sure what I said at the
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
time I'd have to go look at it but I
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't see that there would be insurance
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
for this because it is an aircraft based
 
01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
upon the definition both for RSA and
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
with the federal government so therefore
 
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
I don't you know it's certainly up to
 
01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature but they had repealed um
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
they had repealed insurance for all
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
aircraft so I would think that that
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
would be so now you'd have it for drones
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
but not for a man aircraft so that would
 
01:34:20.109 --> 01:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
be up to the legislature but currently
 
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
it sits right now there is no
 
01:34:25.109 --> 01:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
um Insurance
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
requirement apologize if I had said
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
something incorrect or it was some
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
confusion no that's great thanks one
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
other um minor thing that you had said
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
was um emergency landage should be
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
permitted without risk of fines you know
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
the $25 or
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
something um we would not want to
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
penalize anybody who was who was trying
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
to operate as the pilot in command of
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
that aircraft to land it in a safe
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
manner um and to add a penalty I would
 
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:57.030 align:start position:0%
feel that that would
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:58.430 align:start position:0%
feel that that would
[Music]

01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
be they would try to make a different
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
decision when the safest decision may
 
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
have been to land it in that spot which
 
01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
would be in the State Park or wherever
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
that would be so we actually um I do not
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that Amendment but um we
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
would we would want to see something
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
where that would be Exempted out um
 
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:26.149 align:start position:0%
where that would be Exempted out um
thanks

01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:35:27.199 --> 01:35:31.950 align:start position:0%
is that
it

01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just trying to clarify in my
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
head we already have Federal drone laws
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um to fly as a
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
commercial pilot as a hobbyist um if it
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
weighs more than a certain amount you
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
have to get a $5 permit um can we just
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
take that those laws and just those
 
01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
rules and just apply it to take off and
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
landing in the Parks instead of
 
01:35:59.229 --> 01:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
recreating and instead of Reinventing
 
01:35:59.239 --> 01:36:08.550 align:start position:0%
recreating and instead of Reinventing
the

01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:12.550 align:start position:0%
 
wheel

01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm just asking I don't I feel like
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking about so many
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
different things like do we have
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
insurance that the Federal don't require
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
any of that um they have to be within
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
your site you can't be that far away
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
from you
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
um there there are already so many rules
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
can we just take those rules and just
 
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
apply them to take off and landing in
 
01:36:36.199 --> 01:36:38.629 align:start position:0%
apply them to take off and landing in
our

01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
Parks if I can answer I think I'll try
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
to answer that so two different things I
 
01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
think the the premise of this bill in my
 
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation is simply to allow the
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
takeoff and
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
Landing the air space piece is already
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
in RSA 422 where if you would break
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
federal law you would break state law so
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
that already covers all those other
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
things in in my opinion um and that's
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
um it's in you know between the
 
01:37:07.149 --> 01:37:07.159 align:start position:0%
definitions and the duties of for the
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
Transportation um that is where we put
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
it um in when we added the uas
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
definitions to cover make sure that was
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
covered so that was also added so I
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
think that covers most of it so it just
 
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
comes down to whether the state parks
 
01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
would be per would it would be
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
permissible for them to allow landing
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
off okay all right I think we've got
 
01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
all much as we can on this
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
01:37:43.119 --> 01:37:44.790 align:start position:0%
and there's
any

01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
there we've gotten this additional
 
01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:49.430 align:start position:0%
there we've gotten this additional
information

01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
so don't look on any additional meetings
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
until uh until the 1 where we
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
executive or does
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
somebody expect any or would like to do
 
01:38:05.199 --> 01:38:06.030 align:start position:0%
somebody expect any or would like to do
any

01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
discussion I think
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're there may
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
be I may if I hear if I hear from
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
folks schedule some kind of discussion
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
before the the executive
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
session uh if we if we
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
wish some kind of some kind of formal
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
hearing but if
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
not we will be just going
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
in uh into the
 
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
executive session with the data we
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
have all right with that thank you uh
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
for the testimony and 434 now going now
 
01:38:48.199 --> 01:38:50.109 align:start position:0%
for the testimony and 434 now going now
to

01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:38:50.119 --> 01:38:51.830 align:start position:0%
to
472

01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
472
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
the relative to the replacement of
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
temporary docks
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative rung you have an
 
01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
amendment yes um you should have at your
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:11.390 align:start position:0%
 
2023-24

01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
2023-24
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
H um while you're looking at that I'll
 
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
just give you some background about the
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
work that's been done on this um over
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
the summer representative Darby and I um
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
talk to different stakeholders about it
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor representative
 
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
Crawford and I met with Harry vogle at
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
the lon
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
conservation uh commission or committee
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
and um we discussed it he rais some
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
concerns with having um a set amount of
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
feed he said sometimes Lon nests can be
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
endangered we don't have oh you don't
 
01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.199 --> 01:39:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
copies

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
copies
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.109 --> 01:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
it where did it did they stop what's
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
one know they stop
 
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
here oh whoops ah here they are never
 
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
got past
 
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
me never got past me stop I got we got
 
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
it never got past
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
me ah hey you know that's what happens
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
when you're walking and try to chew gum
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
at the same time thank you so what
 
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see with the amendment is we were
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
going round and round with the original
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
bill but there's already a statute in
 
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
place that gives the commissioner off
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game the
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
power um and you'll see it's um it's uh
 
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
um it's in uh RSA 212 a colon 2 but if
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
you look on the amendment line number 10
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
this is already in statute it says the
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
executive director May adopt and enforce
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
rules temporarily restricting boat
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
traffic on any Waters of the state as
 
01:41:03.589 --> 01:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
the executive director deems necessary
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
to protect any threatened or endangered
 
01:41:07.589 --> 01:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
species of wildlife in the earliest
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
stages of life so we already do that for
 
01:41:16.589 --> 01:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
boats so it would meet the intent of the
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill just to also include with boats
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
temporary docks or
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
Inflatables so if someone's putting
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
something in the water whether it be a
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
boat dock or inflatable and it's
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
threatening the nesting site of an
 
01:41:33.119 --> 01:41:34.350 align:start position:0%
threatening the nesting site of an
endangered

01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
endangered
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
species the fish and game um executive
 
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
director does have the power to go in
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
there and restrict it maybe it's a week
 
01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it's two weeks whether it's a
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
month I don't know how long that nesting
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
period would be so instead of creating a
 
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
new statute we just the amendment is
 
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
just to add temporary docks and
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
Inflatables to what's already there um I
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
met with um Harry vogle yesterday I had
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
a phone call with him he's the the
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
director of The Loon preservation
 
01:42:14.189 --> 01:42:14.199 align:start position:0%
committee he's happy with this um he
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
said there's only maybe one or two calls
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
they get a year that um we're someone is
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
calling because a loon Nest is
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
threatened so it's not like it's not
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
adding work to fish and game um and
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
those one or two calls actually are
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
really important because if a loon loses
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
its nest um because of an inflatable or
 
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
a temporary dock or a boat it won't
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
return and um because of their
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
endangered status we have to do whatever
 
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
we can to protect the the continuation
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:51.390 align:start position:0%
of those
nests

01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
nests
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
so um I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
um representative Darby worked really
 
01:42:59.669 --> 01:42:59.679 align:start position:0%
hard on this too all summer so I presume
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative Darby should have been on
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
here other than repres well I don't know
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
how your name got on there Mr chair but
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
you should be proud that that our names
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
are together but I don't know how it got
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
I think our names are next to each other
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:22.229 align:start position:0%
 
me

01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
anyway any questions or comments anyway
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
what do you think is does it does it do
 
01:43:29.199 --> 01:43:31.629 align:start position:0%
what do you think is does it does it do
the

01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.830 --> 01:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
job I fully support this amendment as
 
01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
it's written um and I really appreciate
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
the time and attention that's been taken
 
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this comes out to
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
everyone's liking I think it's a good
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
sign that your name is on the
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah I didn't scare anybody
 
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
off did
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
I not so far not so far well
 
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
representative Derby and I just like to
 
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
point out I think representative rung
 
01:44:03.629 --> 01:44:03.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned this but this does address the
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
the large concern of the original um
 
01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
bill that it was overly Broad in terms
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
of um you know endangered uh species and
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
that um that would have been it would
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
have been hard to enforce and there was
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
no way to actually um for those
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
temporary dock um people seeking temp
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
temporary dock permits to even determine
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
if they were within that restricted area
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
so this really puts the burden on
 
01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately the the people that want to
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
protect the loons and there and thereby
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
an uh informing fishing game and and um
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
changes the the whole Dynamics to make
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
this much more much more straightforward
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
to um to enforce I
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:52.990 align:start position:0%
to um to enforce I
think

01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone else have any any comments
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
the only comment I might have on that
 
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
just just that is that so long as
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't uh
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner is because there's
 
01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:12.679 align:start position:0%
one it it it seems to
 
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
say he has the right
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
to uh enforce restricted boat traffic or
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
the use of the docks any
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
Waters it's really we're only talking a
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
small section of water and I don't want
 
01:45:26.719 --> 01:45:27.830 align:start position:0%
small section of water and I don't want
any

01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
confusion then that means that
 
01:45:34.109 --> 01:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
oh one there's one one dock that's got a
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
loon problem we're going to shut we're
 
01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
going to take all docks off of that Lake
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to give that kind of
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
authority but if it's if it's
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
even it's even anything to worry about I
 
01:45:50.189 --> 01:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
don't think it is Mr chair because um
 
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
that language was boat so it originally
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
read temporary restricting boat traffic
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
on any Waters of the state so it's
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
really on any lakes or Rivers so it
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean like the whole lake or the
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
whole river it's just you know so if
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's a temporary seasonal dock on a
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
river that's interfering with an
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
endangered nesting site it it's so it's
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
not just exclusive intent there just
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know I don't want to give
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
this people can read it read it the way
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
they want them times you a I could I
 
01:46:25.149 --> 01:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
could shut this whole thing down uh
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative Dar I I I can understand
 
01:46:31.149 --> 01:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
the perspective I think that because
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
this uh this language uh allows the um
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner to adopt rules and they
 
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
already have adopted rules we can look
 
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
at how they've um how they've uh
 
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
interpreted it and and I think we can
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
assume that they would interpret it
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:51.189 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:46:51.199 --> 01:46:52.870 align:start position:0%
good
anyone

01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
else are we okay I will by the way I'm
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
going to send this I'll send a copy of
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
this to Darlene forc who does the uh uh
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
docs and make certain that she uh bues
 
01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.910 align:start position:0%
docs and make certain that she uh bues
into

01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
it she's she's important as far as this
 
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:14.709 align:start position:0%
it she's she's important as far as this
this

01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
issue but down
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
that we all set I think we're all set oh
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
wait one one thing on uh on the on the
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
meeting we're going to have on uh
 
01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.669 align:start position:0%
meeting we're going to have on uh
three

01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
398 Pete we I
 
01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:38.470 align:start position:0%
398 Pete we I
need

01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
what is well you have a concern on what
 
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
we just had yes all right
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.390 align:start position:0%
 
up

01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm Dan burger and
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief of the wildlife division
 
01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:55.639 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
01:47:58.109 --> 01:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
department um we we did have an
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see um the proposed
 
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
language for this amendment and we we do
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
have some concerns about that um I'm not
 
01:48:08.109 --> 01:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
aware that we have ever adopted rules to
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
restrict the boat traffic um in this
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
section um we have some concerns about
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
certainly the broadness of what um the
 
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
anchored seasonal platforms are um which
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
which if you look at the definition
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
could be anything the way I read it is
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
to even a a moing ball in a lake um we
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how exactly we would
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
enforce this um we do so RSA 2112a which
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
is our Endangered Species Act um already
 
01:48:42.669 --> 01:48:42.679 align:start position:0%
does allow us to um it it prevents the
 
01:48:44.669 --> 01:48:44.679 align:start position:0%
take of any threatened or endangered
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
species um so that alone I think may be
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
enough here um so if someone were to put
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
in a you know anything really or any any
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
practice that they might do whether it
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
be a seasonal dock um you know if if any
 
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
of those result in the take of an
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
threatened or endangered species then we
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
can we can step in there and there's
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
some enforcement ability already
 
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
um because of the broadness of this
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment um I'm not exactly sure how I
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
I suppose it would be if someone um if
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
someone if something resulted in a take
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
we would be informed of that in which
 
01:49:27.149 --> 01:49:27.159 align:start position:0%
case RSL RSA 2 2112a already already
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
gives us that ability without this
 
01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.950 align:start position:0%
gives us that ability without this
additional

01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.870 align:start position:0%
additional
language

01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:35.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
R um if if you're concerned about the
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
addition of temporary seasonal docks and
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
anchored seasonal
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
platforms um what what are you doing now
 
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
because it's already in statute about
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
restricting boat traffic when they're
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
threatening um endangered species
 
01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:55.639 align:start position:0%
nesting grounds um it doesn't say
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
anything about taking it's just it only
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
specifically um their nesting locations
 
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
in their earliest stages of Life yeah I
 
01:50:07.149 --> 01:50:07.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not sure as though there's
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
ever been a scenario where we've where
 
01:50:10.109 --> 01:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
we've done that and I don't believe we
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
have any rules in place specific to the
 
01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:13.550 align:start position:0%
have any rules in place specific to the
boat

01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
boat
 
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
traffic okay so but we have the RSA in
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
place just rul support but there's no
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
there's no rules to support that okay
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
y then
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
Darby this is a bit strange to me
 
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
because I've been on uh Lake winnisquam
 
01:50:31.950 --> 01:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
before up in the very Northern section
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
and there's a and I've canoed on that
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
and there's clearly markers that look
 
01:50:41.229 --> 01:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
like they are um you know the same types
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
of markers that you'd see in no wake
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
zones or something like that that says
 
01:50:49.709 --> 01:50:49.719 align:start position:0%
uh no access no boat access Lun nesting
 
01:50:49.719 --> 01:50:50.550 align:start position:0%
uh no access no boat access Lun nesting
area

01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
so I so somehow those those markers got
 
01:50:55.709 --> 01:50:55.719 align:start position:0%
put there yeah I my assumption would be
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
that those are probably um safety areas
 
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
LPC The Loon preservation um committee
 
01:51:09.069 --> 01:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
under what uh under what
 
01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
Authority I'm not sure I I'm not aware
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
that our department puts those signs up
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
it it's LPC them up it is LPC that puts
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
them up the Loon preservation committee
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
are they authorized by
 
01:51:27.149 --> 01:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
Statute not that I'm aware of I think we
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
would be talking about that at this
 
01:51:31.149 --> 01:51:31.159 align:start position:0%
point it sounds like a it sounds like a
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh maybe a private public partnership is
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
going on in this area um but uh I wonder
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
if it's appropriate
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
to um let me ask you would it be
 
01:51:45.149 --> 01:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to add a line that
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
invited your your um folks to develop
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
rules around this
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
this in in this amendment or in this
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah like if we added I'm just
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
saying if the if the sort of will of the
 
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
committee and the will of the
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
legislature were to do enforcement
 
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
preventative enforcement as opposed to
 
01:52:10.589 --> 01:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
just post killing takings like if we
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to do preventative enforcement um
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
could we encourage rulemaking by by
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
including in this piece um not just the
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
temporary seasonal Docks but also
 
01:52:28.589 --> 01:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
um uh the department shall make rules to
 
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
allow for the preventative protection of
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
um well I it's difficult to say I think
 
01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
without speaking to our non-game people
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
on that specifically
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know currently and I think you'd
 
01:52:54.430 --> 01:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
referen that LPC referenced that they
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
might get one or two calls a year on
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
these um so I'm not sure that that that
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislation would even be necessary um
 
01:53:06.990 --> 01:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
given what's already in Statute in
 
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.310 align:start position:0%
given what's already in Statute in
212a

01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
212a
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
um sure um okay thank you that's helpful
 
01:53:17.069 --> 01:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
no in your work in your division is
 
01:53:23.550 --> 01:53:23.560 align:start position:0%
there there's no problem with the LPC
 
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
protecting these no we work very closely
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
with them no absolutely we work very
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
else well is it possible that the LPC
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
can only put up those protective
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
barriers with permission from the Lake
 
01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
Association that's why this legislation
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
might help uh if they can't get
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
permission yeah I I I I can't speak to
 
01:54:01.870 --> 01:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
that because I'm not sure specifically
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
the scenarios when those are put up um
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
we had when the when the bill was
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
originally introduced we had proposed
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
some um some amendments you know our
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
concern initially was um with the
 
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
initial language of the bill pardon me I
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
me find
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
it um was that it had referenced impacts
 
01:54:23.709 --> 01:54:23.719 align:start position:0%
to any Wildlife which which was very
 
01:54:26.910 --> 01:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
broad we had proposed some legis um some
 
01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
changes to the wording um that would
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
have you know focused it on unthreatened
 
01:54:33.629 --> 01:54:33.639 align:start position:0%
and endangered species and put it in
 
01:54:35.229 --> 01:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
line with some of the other existing
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
language um in our endangered species um
 
01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
statutes the
 
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
um again I I I guess we we're not clear
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
how this would operate
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
um um we're not a permitting agency Dees
 
01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
is a permitting agency so when we go
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
through that process like with the
 
01:55:00.510 --> 01:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
existing wording in in in the bill um
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to issue the permit um so you
 
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
know with the original wording uh there
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
might be something like you know uh like
 
01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
an nhb check that would I that would
 
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
help someone know that they were in some
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
sort of proximity to a Lon nest for
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
example um or or any feature that was
 
01:55:20.069 --> 01:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
associated with threatened or endangered
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
species but um um the the proposed
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
amendment seems seems somewhat broad um
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
and we're not I'm not quite sure how how
 
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
that would work um unless it was you
 
01:55:37.069 --> 01:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
know um already after the result of a
 
01:55:38.669 --> 01:55:38.679 align:start position:0%
take regardless and again in which case
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
there's wording in RSA 2112a that that
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
allows us to address that
 
01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
already um but I I think the whole point
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
of this bill was not to let it get to
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
the point where there's a take that um
 
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
we really want to prevent the loss of
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
the nest yeah I and I I agree with that
 
01:56:03.550 --> 01:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm not sure how this
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment would do that though
 
01:56:10.109 --> 01:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
um unless there was some mechanism for
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
us to be aware that something was going
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
to happen prior to it happening which
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
which in my mind would would require um
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
some sort of system for people to
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
contact us to let us know and we'd have
 
01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
to set up a whole new permitting system
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
which which quite frankly we're not
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
really um we don't have the the funding
 
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
or the Staffing to to set that up at
 
01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:39.229 align:start position:0%
or the Staffing to to set that up at
this

01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
time um note that this um this amendment
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
completely you know differs from the
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
original bill which was involving
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
permitting this is no longer involving
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
permitting at all there's no there's no
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
permanent yeah I get that right and one
 
01:56:53.709 --> 01:56:53.719 align:start position:0%
of the problems honestly with the
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
original bill was that it was only when
 
01:56:58.830 --> 01:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
the original um permit was applied would
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
it um would it have come into uh effect
 
01:57:05.229 --> 01:57:05.239 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes you know Nest loons are
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
made after the fact for example on a
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
lake that I'm on on Lake monomac um we
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
have a little island Sailing Club uh
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
Sailing Association owns it and the
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
loons decided luckily to take up a nest
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
on it and actually had a successful
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
hatch this year we're very happy but
 
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
that's a perfect example because they
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
actually had um a dock on that now
 
01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
because it's a Sailing Association the
 
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
Len preservation committee talked to the
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
saling Association and said please don't
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
use your Dock and they were more than
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
happy to oblige but that's not always
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
the case um and so um the um to your
 
01:57:42.669 --> 01:57:42.679 align:start position:0%
question about how it would how they
 
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
would be notified the lon preservation
 
01:57:46.270 --> 01:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
committee knows because they have
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
monitors across the state where the um
 
01:57:52.270 --> 01:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
uh where these loon nests are before as
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
they're building the nests before the
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
before the um eggs are laid um and
 
01:58:00.189 --> 01:58:00.199 align:start position:0%
before this disturbance can can occur so
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's a clear very clear point
 
01:58:07.629 --> 01:58:07.639 align:start position:0%
in time when it can uh when um the um
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
when the notification can take place and
 
01:58:14.149 --> 01:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
then um I would claim that it's um up
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
because fishing game is responsible for
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
um non-game and protecting species like
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
loons um it would be up to them to work
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
with most likely uh Department of Safety
 
01:58:27.069 --> 01:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
or something to to actually um to do
 
01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
that enforcement um I I'm really
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
interested though on the broadness
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
though the terms that are used in this
 
01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
um in this uh uh Amendment are exactly
 
01:58:39.629 --> 01:58:39.639 align:start position:0%
taken from existing statute where there
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
are not only um uh you know definitions
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
and statute about it but also um rules
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
drafted by department of safety for so
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
the terms are actually very clear so I
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm concerned about the use of
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
broadness because this is not a broad
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill at all it's very narrowly scoped no
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm thinking more of a
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
scenario where where the temporary dock
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
was you know not an existing structure
 
01:59:04.830 --> 01:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
that's already there um I'm I'm thinking
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
more along the lines of a you know
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
because the original part of this bill
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
was the temporary seasonal docks so if
 
01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%
if one of those was going to be put out
 
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
um or constructed
 
01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
um you know how that would How would how
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
would we know about that prior to an
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
individual doing it um and again LPC
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
does monitor these but but I could
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
certainly see scenarios um for example
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
the I think the situation where where
 
01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
this bill came from was obviously a
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
missed thank you Mr chair I'm a little
 
01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:46.229 align:start position:0%
missed thank you Mr chair I'm a little
confused

01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
confused
 
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
about what this this is about protecting
 
01:59:54.990 --> 01:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
Nest the fishing game already May adopt
 
01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
and enforce rules okay so that the rules
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
are already in the statute that would
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
temporarily restrict boat traffic so if
 
02:00:08.430 --> 02:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
there if the LPC discovers oh there's a
 
02:00:10.030 --> 02:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
there's a camp that's putting in all
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
these big
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
Inflatables um but they know it's it's
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
near a new loon nest and let's say the
 
02:00:19.629 --> 02:00:19.639 align:start position:0%
operator didn't you know wasn't going to
 
02:00:19.639 --> 02:00:20.870 align:start position:0%
operator didn't you know wasn't going to
restrict

02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
restrict
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
activity the the LPC would then put up
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
those kind of those buoys that they have
 
02:00:29.310 --> 02:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
to limit boat traffic just say but
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
they'd have to do that in conjunction
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
with fish and game because that's
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
already that that's being done now for
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
boat traffic you said you work in
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
partnership with LPC to have them
 
02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:42.679 align:start position:0%
protect these Nest while during that
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
nesting cycle so what would be the
 
02:00:49.629 --> 02:00:49.639 align:start position:0%
difference if we're providing that same
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
protection when there are these very
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
specific temporary structures placed in
 
02:00:59.870 --> 02:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
water wouldn't we want LPC to be able to
 
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
restrict activity around there until the
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
nesting cycle is
 
02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:09.639 align:start position:0%
over um yes um again I think part of our
 
02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
concern was was particularly the
 
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
um um and I guess maybe it boils down to
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
the specifics of the rules that are
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
written in in conjunction with this but
 
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
um again those uh I think it was the
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
temporary seasonal platforms which which
 
02:01:29.069 --> 02:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
again could even be just a moing ball um
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
um I suppose we would certainly be happy
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
to um to have further discussion and and
 
02:01:39.870 --> 02:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh um um perhaps there's um perhaps some
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
some further discussion would um and
 
02:01:44.589 --> 02:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
maybe the potential for what rules might
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
look like would would make us feel a
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
little more comfortable with it yeah
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
because we do have words and there the
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
the important word is as the executive
 
02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
director of fishing game deems necessary
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not going to just be
 
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
any uh temporary dock even near a
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
nesting would have to be necessary to
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
protect that Nest um what Mr vogle was
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
explaining to representative Crawford
 
02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
and me is sometimes you can have a
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
temporary dock within 50 feet of a
 
02:02:15.149 --> 02:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
nesting of a nest and it's not going to
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
disturb the nest sometimes it could be
 
02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
300 feet away so it's important to
 
02:02:23.470 --> 02:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
understand what's what's deemed
 
02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:25.719 align:start position:0%
necessary so I
 
02:02:28.109 --> 02:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
think the wording that was used in the
 
02:02:30.069 --> 02:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
original statute and then this amendment
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
is just adding those two items is is
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
really leaving it up to the
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
professionalism of fishing game to
 
02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
determine if if a nest is at risk or not
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
and then giving fishing game the
 
02:02:47.229 --> 02:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
authority to provide um to temporarily
 
02:02:51.149 --> 02:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
restrict um so i' I'd be you know and it
 
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
does talk about rules and enforcement so
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
I I I think this is just all about
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
protecting that nest and allowing
 
02:02:59.229 --> 02:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
fishing game to take that necessary
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
steps to protect that Nest during that
 
02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
nesting cycle and I think we get away
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
from all of the issues that an an owner
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
would have with a do temporary dog
 
02:03:12.669 --> 02:03:12.679 align:start position:0%
permit I mean there there was so many
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
holes in the original bill that we
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
discovered upon public hearing and I
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
think this really gets to the Crux of
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
what that legislative intent is um and
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
provides a great balance for fishing
 
02:03:26.669 --> 02:03:26.679 align:start position:0%
game to construct those rules to
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
specifically protect nests of endangered
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
species in
 
02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:33.430 align:start position:0%
species in
water

02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
water
 
02:03:36.510 --> 02:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
so I I just wanted to clarify that okay
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:55.069 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:03:55.069 --> 02:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
all right the uh 472 we're
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh that's it on that we'll uh I think
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're in good shape on
 
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
that uh the uh one one additional thing
 
02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
that uh the uh one one additional thing
on

02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
398 uh haven't
 
02:04:19.229 --> 02:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
actually formally uh determined the
 
02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
people who the will be on three 398
