uh the design of this bill
 
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
is to counteract income tax avoidance by
 
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:39.380 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
via a profit shifting to tax Havens and
 
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
foreign jurisdictions
 
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
my concern is that
 
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not treat all
 
00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
multinational taxpayers equitably with
 
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
domestic taxpayers and that the unitary
 
00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge method grants an
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional advantage
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
to foreign-based multinationals
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
operating our state
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
understand that I'm not opposed to
 
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
foreign Acquisitions of New Hampshire
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
companies what I'm opposed to is foreign
 
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
corporations operating in New Hampshire
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
that pays zero or minimal minimal
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
corporate income taxes
 
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
this house bill 102 would reform our New
 
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire BPT tax
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
accounting method from Water's Edge to
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting method that
 
00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
when mandate companies include their U.S
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
profits held in offshore tax Haven
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
accounts when calculating their taxes
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
this profit shifting is accomplished
 
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.670 align:start position:0%
this profit shifting is accomplished
through

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
basically inter-company transactions via
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing at supposedly an arm's
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
length when dealing with a subsidiary it
 
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:53.060 align:start position:0%
would be like company a
 
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
owns subsidiary Company B and instead of
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
doing what they would do with most
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
companies that are out in the public
 
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.990 align:start position:0%
companies that are out in the public
uh

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
they supposedly are saying we are
 
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
dealing with an arm's length when we ask
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
for a price for we want to buy this from
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
them just like we would do with somebody
 
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.829 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
transactions basically are treated as if
 
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
unrelated and not affiliated and in my
 
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
research with the GAO the IRS and even
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire uh
 
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
the Supreme New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
had mentioned in a case in 1999
 
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
we point out that the water's edge
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
method was adopted for the benefit of
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
foreign businesses and this has brought
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
me now to why I reintroduced this bill
 
00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.290 align:start position:0%
me now to why I reintroduced this bill
um

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
what this does is it causes domestic
 
00:09:59.650 --> 00:09:59.660 align:start position:0%
companies that do not have multinational
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
Affiliates to pay a higher effective tax
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
rate than their multinational
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
competitors or domestic
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
competitors I would like to
 
00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:11.810 align:start position:0%
competitors I would like to
uh

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
that this Ways and Means Committee
 
00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:20.459 align:start position:0%
hopefully vote to retain this bill
 
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
so that it weighs a means study
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee can delve into all the aspects
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the worldwide combined reporting
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
versus unitary Waters Edge accounting
 
00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:31.019 align:start position:0%
method and that all members would be
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
able to attend
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.490 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
consideration

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony with
 
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
representative Schoenberg questions of
 
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:43.700 align:start position:0%
Representative Schoenberg
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
let me get my
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I don't I don't
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
really have specific questions I'm quite
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with this from last term
 
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
um and I think we've decided last term
 
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
that we we definitely needed to study
 
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
this thoroughly before we acted on any
 
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
any bill that would change the way we
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
treated the water's edge companies
 
00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:17.269 align:start position:0%
treated the water's edge companies
so

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I I would support I would support uh
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
us taking a look at it more if anything
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
just an educational thing
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
um I think the dra is willing to also uh
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
support uh being involved
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
um because it's been such a long time
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
since we've that even the dra has looked
 
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
at this issue I mean going back a couple
 
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
of decades I think
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh I view this more as educational for
 
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
everybody and I I would support a motion
 
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
to uh retain and study thank you
 
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.550 align:start position:0%
to uh retain and study thank you
okay

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.090 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.329 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:11:59.329 --> 00:11:59.339 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and
 
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schanberg for
 
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
your extraordinary work on this
 
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
really really important subject and
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
really really complicated and hard to
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
understand subject
 
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
so much appreciated
 
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
um and I share representative abrami's
 
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
view that this merits close attention by
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
the committee and it can't be done in
 
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
the rush of uh getting bills
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh through to be considered by the full
 
00:12:37.329 --> 00:12:37.339 align:start position:0%
house right now but it could be
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
well considered uh if retained
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
um and my question to you representative
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
Schamberg is a request that you spell
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
out a little bit more
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
how this transfer pricing works
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
um how is it that
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
a multinational transnational
 
00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:01.490 align:start position:0%
a multinational transnational
Corporation

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
Corporation
 
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.449 align:start position:0%
Corporation
um

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
um through being viewed as a Water's
 
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:10.820 align:start position:0%
Edge company
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
manipulate prices in effect
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
so that what we see here in New
 
00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:19.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or what the United States is
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
more broadly as the attributable
 
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
property to
 
00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:28.339 align:start position:0%
this country or this state
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
is much less than what it really should
 
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.030 align:start position:0%
is much less than what it really should
be

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
the answer though can you speak to that
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
I can speak to it in a general
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
proposition uh
 
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.389 align:start position:0%
proposition uh
the

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
foreign parent groups with U.S
 
00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:47.210 align:start position:0%
foreign parent groups with U.S
subsidiaries

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh like all multinational corporations
 
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.329 align:start position:0%
uh like all multinational corporations
uh

00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:53.339 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
as stated by the GAO and the IRS
 
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
May engage in income shifting to
 
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
low-tech jurisdictions in order to evade
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
not only New Hampshire Texas but to
 
00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
evade U.S taxes
 
00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:10.670 align:start position:0%
evade U.S taxes
um

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.610 align:start position:0%
um
multi

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
multi
 
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
National corporate group whether it's
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
U.S owned or foreign owned may have
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries in countries outside the
 
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
United States
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
or corporate tax rates may be lower and
 
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
or corporate tax rates may be lower and
uh

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
can provide a scope for
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
income shifting through practices such
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
as manipulation of the transfer price
 
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.870 align:start position:0%
as manipulation of the transfer price
from

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
a subsidiary of theirs
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
that as I was saying earlier that maybe
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
sells it to a non-affiliated company at
 
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
ten dollars
 
00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:56.339 align:start position:0%
would sell or transfer the price to
 
00:14:56.339 --> 00:14:57.769 align:start position:0%
would sell or transfer the price to
maybe

00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars between each other and
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
this is that arm's length approach that
 
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
that is concerning
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
is that we're not seeing the actual real
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
profits that could be taxed
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:21.430 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
um

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
I I guess that's the best I can do with
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
that right now representative Ames if I
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
could do a follow-up
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.829 align:start position:0%
follow up
um

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
so I I've seen examples of how this
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
plays out where a subsidiary in a low
 
00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
tax jurisdiction outside of the United
 
00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:41.750 align:start position:0%
tax jurisdiction outside of the United
States

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.129 align:start position:0%
States
um

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:43.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:46.019 align:start position:0%
is uh reporting
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
taxable profits to that jurisdiction
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
that are greater than the gross national
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
product of that jurisdiction
 
00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.449 align:start position:0%
product of that jurisdiction
um

00:15:58.449 --> 00:15:58.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
reflecting the phenomenon that you're
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
trying to describe have you seen
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
examples like that
 
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.410 align:start position:0%
examples like that
oh

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
I don't have any particular
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh information other than articles that
 
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
publishing tax notes one of the most
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
recent ones
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
is what um
 
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.769 align:start position:0%
is what um
Coca-Cola

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
Coca-Cola
 
00:16:31.569 --> 00:16:31.579 align:start position:0%
has recently been charged
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
with uh profit shifting uh
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
that they had originally had approval
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
from the IRS but it's like you said they
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
went to a uh it was a royalty charge
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
and they were
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
almost three billion dollars that the
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
IRS is finally
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
been able to hopefully recoup for the
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
United States
 
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
I'd have to go into my research and my
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
papers to find you some examples
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
fine thank you
 
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.970 align:start position:0%
fine thank you
okay

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
um I do have something to say on this is
 
00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:05.929 align:start position:0%
um I do have something to say on this is
that

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
I did talk
 
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
with the era on this
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
and they said it is a extremely
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
complicated issue
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
and it would take the dra a lot of time
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
to get up to speed on this because the
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
last time
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
it was present in New Hampshire was in
 
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
the 80s
 
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
and hasn't been used since then
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
to retain it
 
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
and see if we can work for the dra so
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we can all understand what this
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
really is
 
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.610 align:start position:0%
really is
so

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:48.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm sorry representation
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
just a little follow-up
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
the state of Virginia
 
00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
is revisiting combined reporting that
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
they've turned over to a study committee
 
00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.610 align:start position:0%
they've turned over to a study committee
also

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:03.620 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
we do have someone within the
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
continental United States now that is
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tucker
 
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh yes I I must say that last year when
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
the topic came up I was afraid that I
 
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.909 align:start position:0%
the topic came up I was afraid that I
would

00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
not be able to uh
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
follow the discussion
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
and but I think that the really the two
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
overriding points are that there's a
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
possibility that there are New Hampshire
 
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:41.780 align:start position:0%
companies that are being treated
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
inequitably to in
 
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
in regard to multinationals
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
and two that we could be missing out on
 
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
some tax income
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
that we should be getting
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
and it turned out that
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
there is enough available material
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
written for people who are not
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh phds and economics so that the
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
arguments can be followed and I hope
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
that we can support this retention idea
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
and have a good study I think we'll
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
learn a lot about the big picture of
 
00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire at the same
 
00:19:24.179 --> 00:19:25.370 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire at the same
time

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.789 align:start position:0%
time
representative

00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.049 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:19:32.049 --> 00:19:32.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
last year when we put this into interim
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
study it was for the same purposes
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
retained so that we could understand it
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
better and at that time
 
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
we thought that we would be able to do
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
it last summer last fall and instead we
 
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:54.539 align:start position:0%
had coveted on and
 
00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:57.059 align:start position:0%
in the fall when they finally got to the
 
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:00.140 align:start position:0%
point where we could meet as a committee
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
they had to have every single committee
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
meet as uh
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
in order to take care of their interim
 
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
study bills they told us we could only
 
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
have an hour and a half for both our
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
interim study bills the other one took
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
an hour during that hour and a half if I
 
00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:21.419 align:start position:0%
remember correctly uh and
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
so we
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
abandoned abandoned very reluctantly our
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
ability to do this as a full committee
 
00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:33.380 align:start position:0%
there were some of us that did meet
 
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
on on the Democratic side and we uh have
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
assembled a lot of of resources human
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
research-wise that I had hoped we would
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
be able to share by now but on
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
this session like the last one is being
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
so chaotic in many ways that on it's
 
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
very difficult under covet for the
 
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
legislature that on
 
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
it isn't quite finished yet but we will
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
have a kind of Guide to the literature
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
on from the people that are most
 
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
concerned with this issue and there is
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
one person in attendees
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
who I would have hoped my
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
my testify but you know apparently he
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
didn't put his hand up uh from that
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh from the sustainable uh business
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
on I forget exactly what the name of it
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
is but it's a very large uh Association
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
of businesses that do not operate
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
internationally and feel that they are
 
00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:51.539 align:start position:0%
being competed against
 
00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
um anybody else wish to comment attest
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
or ask questions if not
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
does the committee feel that we can
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
we have one person that signed up to
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
testify and I believe it might be the
 
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.970 align:start position:0%
testify and I believe it might be the
one

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:12.980 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
a David Morse
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
a member of the public who signed up to
 
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:24.980 align:start position:0%
testify and supported the bill
 
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
Mr David Morse
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
yes hello can you hear me yes
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
I am uh definitely here on uh on behalf
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
of myself this time however uh I wanted
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
to uh comment and support this uh
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
legislation worldwide combine on
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
specifically from a pro-business
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh just to give you a little
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
bit about who I am I've been working for
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
the last eight years
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
on with the expertise of small business
 
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
and other experts regarding the real
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
world consequences of Water's Edge style
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
legislation uh my primary focus is
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
usually on the federal level but we've
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
been focused also on the state level for
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
some time uh to be com completely
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
forthright I was also a minor
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
contributing author on the paper that
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
was mentioned by representative
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
Schamberg as credited by the tax Journal
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
tax notes
 
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
the reason why I support this
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislation is because the water's edge
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
is a product of a bygone era in
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
international relations
 
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
and in particular this references the
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
United Kingdom and Japan back in the 80s
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
when they were pressuring the United
 
00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:49.580 align:start position:0%
States government
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
now that entire system has shifted and
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
both of those countries along with many
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
others are more concerned about the tax
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
avoidance of the largest multinational
 
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.730 align:start position:0%
avoidance of the largest multinational
companies

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
than they are about protecting
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
their corporations from U.S taxes
 
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
now the effects that were described by
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg are very real
 
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
there's a tax differential is what it's
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
known as between Multinational
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprises and small domestic companies
 
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.570 align:start position:0%
Enterprises and small domestic companies
now

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
in the best example that I can give
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
for anecdote is probably the beer
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
industry where you have
 
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
Anheuser-Busch that has one of the most
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
complicated subsidiary structures in the
 
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.730 align:start position:0%
complicated subsidiary structures in the
world

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason that it developed that
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
way was so that they could gain a
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
competitive business advantage using
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
their subsidiaries uh Anheuser-Busch
 
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
inbev you know it's a big long name but
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
by this point it has management from
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
Brazil ownership from Europe and
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately has managed to avoid paying a
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
lot of taxes that are local craft
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
Brewers in the United States and in New
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire end up having to pay
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
now I will completely admit that New
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could not solve the entire
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
full tax disparity by itself uh but it
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
can remove its contribution to the
 
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
problem whenever a state finds itself in
 
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
a financial crunch there is inevitably
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
going to be discussion of raising tax
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
rates however if you have put the system
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
in effect where one group is paying a
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
lower percentage than the other
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
then when you raise the rates you're
 
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
raising and raising them inequitably
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
so you have to resolve that tax
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
disparity first between the rates before
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
you then move on
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
and raise the rates overall otherwise
 
00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:00.539 align:start position:0%
you're going to hurt more likely the
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
small businesses in your own State than
 
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
you are
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
to affect the overall the overall tax
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
base so that the difficulty is shared
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
equally amongst all the businesses
 
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.190 align:start position:0%
equally amongst all the businesses
now

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
I am very grateful for this moment to
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
discuss this with the committee and I
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
you may have for me
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:36.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
representative you want to unmute
 
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.769 align:start position:0%
representative you want to unmute
yourself

00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
could you have our guest please identify
 
00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
the group that he represents or belongs
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
to that uh representative Albany
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
but Mr Moss oh absolutely absolutely so
 
00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:03.419 align:start position:0%
I must State for the record that
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
um my I am here volunteering my my board
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
did not approve uh my attendance here as
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
part of the Coalition for a prosperous
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
America that's the group that I work for
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
as the tax policy director however this
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
is a matter under their discussion as to
 
00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
which whether or not they will be
 
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:24.539 align:start position:0%
getting involved more directly on this
 
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
issue specifically for New Hampshire
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
we primarily focus on the federal level
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
now the group that uh representative Ami
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
was trying to bring up is a group that I
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
am affiliated with I've worked with uh
 
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
although I'm not paid directly through
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm not being paid today and that
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
would be the American sustainable
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
Business Council
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
they are a one of the contributing
 
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.529 align:start position:0%
they are a one of the contributing
groups

00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:48.539 align:start position:0%
groups
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh regarding the paper that was
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier and additionally uh
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
there is a affiliate uh Coalition called
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
the salesfactor.org it is a group that
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
is sponsored by a gentleman by the name
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
of Mr Bill parks and miss and Mr Parks
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
is very dedicated to this issue as well
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
but uh these are all groups that I have
 
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
connections to and affiliations with uh
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
just for the record good that's what I
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr
 
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:31.669 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr
um

00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
um no you know you mentioned
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
Anheuser-Busch you know years a couple
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
years ago I dawned on me that the
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
Anheuser-Busch is no longer an American
 
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.850 align:start position:0%
Anheuser-Busch is no longer an American
company

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh that it's ownership changed hands
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure there's a lot of that going
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
on for other businesses as well
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
um but the real question I have is
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
although Anheuser-Busch does have a
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
pretty big footprint here in New
 
00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are modeling uh in New
 
00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:01.789 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are modeling uh in New
Hampshire

00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:29:01.799 --> 00:29:03.710 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
but

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.789 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of of other states
 
00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:08.750 align:start position:0%
in terms of of other states
um

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative Schoenberg mentioned
 
00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
Virginia is starting to look at this do
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
you know of given given your
 
00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
affiliations with these different
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
organizations do you know of other
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
states that are are even taking a peek
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
at this at the moment at the moment
 
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
there has been some consideration uh
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
specifically uh last year I believe it
 
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
was uh Montana and then there was some
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
discussion in Oregon as well uh there
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
the state of Alaska treats their uh
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
their oil Revenue under a single sales
 
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
Factor uh worldwide is my best
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of its practical
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
application already in existence
 
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.649 align:start position:0%
application already in existence
but

00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
the this has been considered a natural
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
replacement to what is known as a tax
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
Haven uh legislation uh in particular
 
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
Oregon and Montana had tax Haven
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
legislation where there was a blacklist
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
of tax Havens so these are low tax
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions where the
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
the tax rate of that jurisdiction is so
 
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
low that it is creating what is known as
 
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
an investment Hub it there that's the
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
polite way of saying they're taking the
 
00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
money and they're giving the best tax
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
rate possible even though they have so
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
few employees there that it doesn't make
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
any sense why that money would be stored
 
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.049 align:start position:0%
any sense why that money would be stored
there

00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:39.059 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
but it these investment hubs are
 
00:30:42.539 --> 00:30:44.630 align:start position:0%
but it these investment hubs are
particularly

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.750 align:start position:0%
particularly
um

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
energized to go back to those States and
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
then try to uh lobby as to why they
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be considered uh part of the
 
00:30:57.769 --> 00:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
tax Haven list
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
um that has proven frustrating it was
 
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
particularly frustrating in Oregon so
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
they have uh revised and reviewed how
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
they're going to do this but they
 
00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:07.490 align:start position:0%
they're going to do this but they
haven't

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:09.299 align:start position:0%
um they haven't decided fully how
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to tackle the water's edge
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
um there are other states just to
 
00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
mention other states on ways that they
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
plan to deal with this the biggest Focus
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
has been on what is known as digital
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
service taxes or uh digital advertising
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
taxes these uh Maryland just passed one
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
of these um however
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
many academics uh include
 
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
that I know of believe that it will not
 
00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
pass constitutional muster unlike the
 
00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299 align:start position:0%
procedure that would involve getting rid
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the water's edge which has in fact
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
been proven to uh
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has ruled on it in the
 
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
past that the states have the ability to
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh get rid of their Water's Edge if they
 
00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
so choose so it's got a stronger base to
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
work from than digital service taxes
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
which is one of the reasons why I prefer
 
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.490 align:start position:0%
which is one of the reasons why I prefer
it

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Mr Lewis I I
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
want to know because the even the
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh motion is to retain this
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh how long does your organization
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
need and and others like it to come up
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
with a bill uh sponsored by anybody here
 
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.090 align:start position:0%
with a bill uh sponsored by anybody here
uh

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:40.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
get rid of this problem of the water's
 
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.190 align:start position:0%
get rid of this problem of the water's
edge

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
edge
 
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.510 align:start position:0%
edge
um

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
so do you have a time
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
frame here that you would like to see a
 
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass and how long will
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.529 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:00.539 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
this is difficult because it is my
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
subjective view versus my objective view
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
but I will say in all honesty
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
subjectively we Water's Edge would have
 
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
been gone yesterday uh however reality
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
being what it is it makes absolute sense
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
that uh there would be some sort of
 
00:33:18.179 --> 00:33:19.310 align:start position:0%
that uh there would be some sort of
study

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
um specifically to the state because it
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
is important to know what kind of
 
00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
Revenue would be raised from such a
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
thing but it is important also to note
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
that without it any uh attempts to
 
00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.210 align:start position:0%
that without it any uh attempts to
um

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
move towards say single sales factor
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
which I also personally support uh will
 
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
mean that you usually lose Revenue so
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
you definitely need to be considering
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
this issue when you're trying to balance
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
how much uh Revenue would be lost versus
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
gained in
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
um as you the state of New Hampshire
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
decides what it's going to do about
 
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor
 
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
um any state that abandons the
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
three-factor model needs to know that
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is probably going to be a revenue
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
loss unless there is a uh
 
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
abandonment of the water's edge election
 
00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.990 align:start position:0%
abandonment of the water's edge election
and

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
instead using worldwide combined
 
00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:18.899 align:start position:0%
reporting so
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
if we could have it
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
um sooner the better that but I can't
 
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.250 align:start position:0%
um sooner the better that but I can't
testify

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
um in all honesty
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
that we have a exact timeline written
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
down we've been
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
taking a look at what the landscape
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
looks like in New Hampshire right now
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
um and as I think uh representative
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
balmy might have mentioned earlier it
 
00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:49.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
not thank you Mr Morris there are four
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
other people that signed up north Norm I
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
did have a question
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
is the gentleman still there I'm still
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
here if you can hear me yeah you
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned single sales Factor
 
00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.770 align:start position:0%
mentioned single sales Factor
um

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
this chamber the how uh the house is is
 
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
against moving quickly to single sales
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
Factor but the Senate seems to want to
 
00:35:20.569 --> 00:35:20.579 align:start position:0%
move forward and it's in law right now
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
did I hear you correctly by saying that
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
uh Water's Edge companies would benefit
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
uh if we move forward with single sales
 
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
factor is the state
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
yes it by its very definition uh
 
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
especially in smaller States uh it is
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
more beneficial
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
to have a Water's Edge with single sales
 
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
factor for a company that can
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
use these techniques and what is known
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
as being tax aggressive tax planning
 
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
aggressive what you're saying is that
 
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
your your opinion is that this would be
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
a negative of revenues to New Hampshire
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
if this move forward
 
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
without being able to look at the data I
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
can't uh
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
guarantee it but it that's been my
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
experience if that's the result uh when
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
we do the modeling in other states okay
 
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you good question uh
 
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley
 
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.089 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley
okay

00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:20.099 --> 00:36:21.530 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's there's one more attendee David
 
00:36:28.329 --> 00:36:28.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay yes all right we'll bring them in
 
00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:35.099 align:start position:0%
before I announce the ones in opposition
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay Mr Juve
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
give him one second to get there
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
committee I trust you can hear me okay
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you for allowing me the
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify I did sign up in
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill but I didn't do
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
it soon enough to show up on your list
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
of uh people wanting to verbally testify
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Dave Juve I'm
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
a senior vice president with the
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association and we
 
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
had reached out to representative
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
Schomburg late last year I think or
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps in January to uh meet with bia's
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy committee to discuss this
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and we were able to have a
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
good and productive conversation and I
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
appreciate the representative for making
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
himself available
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
however the committee discussion
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
afterwards seemed to indicate there were
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
more questions about this uh proposal
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
than than answers so even though Bia was
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill I do encourage uh
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider are retaining
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
this although I have to express a
 
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
concern with that too and my concern is
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
this is such a complicated issue and
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
there are limits to uh committee
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
activity in terms of a retained bill to
 
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
me this would represent as big a change
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
in tax policy for the state as moving to
 
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing or moving to
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor both of those issues
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
had a full-blown commission which gave
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
the legislature time to really do a deep
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
dive into the issue it also allowed them
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
to plan for expert testimony and also to
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
have expertise on the commission from
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
people who had experience in those
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
issues and I recognize that
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
changing this to a commission
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
where you can do a deep dive and have a
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
little more time than having to report
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
out sometime in the fall has its
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
limitations to one is uh we're we're not
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
sure how the Senate would respond to
 
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
that and obviously you don't need Senate
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
support for a retained uh
 
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
um a retained Bill all that is to say is
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
I would support uh the committee doing
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh much more additional work on this
 
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
legislation and would certainly support
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
a commission as opposed to retained
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
study just to give more chance for
 
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
expertise testimony and more time to to
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
make the right decision thank you Mr
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
chair I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:26.569 align:start position:0%
chair I'd be happy to answer any
questions

00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Jimmy
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr duvet
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
saying none there's one more hand raised
 
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
in the attendees
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh GBA is all it says
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
hold on one second oh it's gone oh nope
 
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:52.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
we have to be careful because there are
 
00:39:58.930 --> 00:39:58.940 align:start position:0%
people who know how to work the system
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
yeah the last minute after listening to
 
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.530 align:start position:0%
yeah the last minute after listening to
everybody

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
they jump in
 
00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:07.130 align:start position:0%
they jump in
so

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
and they lowered their hand so okay
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
we have four people that signed up
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
to oppose the bill
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
but they're not going to testify
 
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
and they say they're all members of the
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
public and representing themselves such
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
as David Matthew did
 
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh David Morris and these four people
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
are Alexander Manila
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
Elliot axelman
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:49.460 align:start position:0%
anybody else listens
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
justify for or support the bill if not
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
do you think we have enough information
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
let me know if not then maybe
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
representative Schoenberg might want to
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
make a motion we're going we're going to
 
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:18.300 align:start position:0%

Schoenberg
 
00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.170 align:start position:0%
Schoenberg
uh

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg would like to
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
make a motion to
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
retain this bill House Bill 102 in ways
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
and means
 
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:44.050 align:start position:0%
and means
seconds

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative Sandberg made the motion
 
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
to retain the bill second by
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley any further
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
discussion on this
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
00:41:59.930 --> 00:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
I see none uh Mr chairman
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to ask that we managed to
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
put considerable time into this if if we
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
retain it on we do I really would like
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
to see it retained but to make sure that
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
that on whoever is really interested in
 
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
following this up can can meet several
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
times in the the late summer or fall
 
00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
well my feeling is is that
 
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
they will be meeting a few times but
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
they will not it will not be enough and
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
that they would recommend legislation to
 
00:42:38.329 --> 00:42:38.339 align:start position:0%
form a commission
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
so it can be adequately studied with
 
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
sufficient time
 
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
that would be excellent
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh any further discussion on the motion
 
00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.020 align:start position:0%

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh see this bill be retained
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot a lot of work needs to
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
be done uh as we talked this bill
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
through there were more and more federal
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
tax codes
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
that came into play as to which of the
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
which of the Charities would fall under
 
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
this raffle bill
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
um we need to need to clarify all that
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
not enough time now to do it so let's
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
let's retain it and uh and do it right
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
I think if we limit the number my my
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
personal feeling is that I I don't have
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
a problem with certain Charities being
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
able to play raffle Raffles but uh we
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
just if the Bill's not ready and uh and
 
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think uh representative ulery
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
felt he had enough time to to fix the
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%

um yeah so I am I am representative
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
Donovan Fenton I represent Keane
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
um here today to talk to you about HB
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
252 which is creating a committee to
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
study the creation of a program giving
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
employers tax credits on business taxes
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
in exchange for providing statements for
 
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
child care needs to employees and that
 
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
is a mouthful so I will keep this brief
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
um because we're talking about study
 
01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
committee uh the reason for this bill um
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
I came up with this um because I lost
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
employees during covid-19 we have a
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
family business and I'm proud to say we
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
didn't lose anyone because business was
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
slow and we need to get rid of them but
 
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
because we lost them uh because they had
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
to stay at home and take care of their
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
kids who were out of school
 
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
um daycares clothes schools closed so
 
01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
one parent had to stay home uh you know
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
this pandemic has really changed how we
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
look at everything you know parents are
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
home now and so are kids uh they can't
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
juggle being on a zoom call while trying
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
to get their child bogged onto their
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
math class and so we need to get them
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
back to work you know they're the
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
backbone of New Hampshire's economy
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
um you know options for funding Child
 
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
Care Limited which is why business tax
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
credits could be a potential Avenue for
 
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
bolstering this field I know several
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
credits already exists for the BBT such
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
as cdfa Investments non-profits
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
scholarships so this could fall in line
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
um you know this would be a study
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
committee uh to study this issue to see
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
if it's feasible to implement and with
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
that I'll take any questions questions
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
or yeah
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
Fenton did you consider any other way
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
than uh cutting further into our
 
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
business taxes to do this
 
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
through studying how much it would cost
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
to do it yeah absolutely and
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
question so the reason I chose kind of
 
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
the business tax is um you know the the
 
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
way I look at it is you know the
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
marginal rate of the BPT is now what's
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
affecting our economy right now I think
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
Child Care remote learning is what the
 
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
issue is you know and I think it will
 
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:52.940 align:start position:0%
just pay itself forward if we have
 
01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
employers who can hire more uh employees
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
you know because a lot of people can't
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
work right now because of their children
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
and I think New Hampshire has the 12th
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
highest child care costs in the nation
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
so I think this would really supplement
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for your
 
01:03:19.319 --> 01:03:20.390 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for your
testimony

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
um do you know of any New Hampshire
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
companies that are doing this
 
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.609 align:start position:0%
companies that are doing this
voluntarily

01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
question uh no I don't um and I think I
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
stated this earlier you know I have a
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
family business we actually employ 200
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
full-time and part-time people uh and we
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually looked into this before and we
 
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
just you know we can't make it feasible
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
because the exuberant costs of child
 
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
care right now and it's more difficult
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
with parents at home
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
um who sometimes need to hire a
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
babysitter and you know I'm not saying
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
that babysitting should be part of this
 
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:53.339 align:start position:0%
program but that's why a study committee
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
would be fantastic to see if it's
 
01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:56.579 align:start position:0%
feasible for someone who is zooming at
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
home you know to hire a babysitter and
 
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:13.130 align:start position:0%
any further questions
representative

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
my question is I want to get this
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
correct now we give the employer uh tax
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
credits and the employer a page for
 
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
babysitting is that correct
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative Elliot thanks for the
 
01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
question uh yes and no
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
um couch if so I used babysitting as
 
01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
just an example but that wouldn't
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily be part of this program I
 
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
was more stating that you know uh
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
working has changed since the pandemic
 
01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
so you know some some parents are
 
01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
working from home and unfortunately they
 
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
can't uh bring their child to daycare
 
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
because a lot of them aren't operating
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
right now and some might need to hire a
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
babysitter for you know 30 minutes while
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
they're on a zoom call presenting a bill
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
per se
 
01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
um but you know that that could be a
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
feasible option not babysitting but more
 
01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
online of uh for child care needs for
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
school needs
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative yes I I'm very interested
 
01:05:31.609 --> 01:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
that someone has come up with um
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
a bill addresses a very current problem
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
but it seems to be rather narrowly
 
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.589 align:start position:0%
but it seems to be rather narrowly
constructed

01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
as I think representative almie pointed
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
out that it just talked about a credit
 
01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:47.990 align:start position:0%
out that it just talked about a credit
arrangement

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
arrangement
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
would you be interested in broadening
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
the wording so that this could also take
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
on the study of what has happened from
 
01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
this pandemic who has been affected what
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
kind of businesses and what kind of
 
01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.690 align:start position:0%
kind of businesses and what kind of
employees

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:04.700 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
particularly gender related uh where I
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
gather there's more of a problem
 
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.589 align:start position:0%
gather there's more of a problem
and

01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
then see where it comes out
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
rather than coming up with a particular
 
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
solution to what has turned out to be a
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
major problem
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker yes absolutely
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
um and I I would absolutely be open to
 
01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
broadening this bill I think I really
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
want to get across so the main reason
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
for this is I want this bill to be
 
01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:37.619 align:start position:0%
advantageous for both the employer and
 
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
the employee you know we're asking
 
01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
um you know the employers to step up but
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
we need help with an investment from
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
that tax credit so the reason I chose
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
that was because I always wanted to make
 
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
it so that businesses weren't being hurt
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
but I absolutely agree that you know we
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
could broaden this bill
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
great well I'm sure there are lots of
 
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
people who could help you who have been
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
deeply involved in this obviously you
 
01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
have too with your family business but I
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
I hope that you can do that because I I
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
really think that having uh while we all
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
remember what it's been like you know a
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
year or two from now it will the
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic will fade in our memories
 
01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:23.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
is there a question about no okay
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
further questions yeah Mr chair I have
 
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
one I'm unable to raise my hand
 
01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.349 align:start position:0%
one I'm unable to raise my hand
digitally

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
digitally
 
01:07:33.359 --> 01:07:36.109 align:start position:0%
digitally
okay

01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for visiting our
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
committee today representative currently
 
01:07:44.089 --> 01:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
if a business elects to give a stipend
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
to an employee they get that as a tax
 
01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:48.410 align:start position:0%
to an employee they get that as a tax
deduction

01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
and what what you're what you want to
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
study a little bit more in depth is
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
elevating that deduction to a credit is
 
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:08:00.049 --> 01:08:00.059 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you for it so
 
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
yeah as you said that you are correct a
 
01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
stipend would be
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
um as it stands now is a deductible but
 
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
was changed to a credit
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
but again this is a study committee that
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
can be changed and as uh representative
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
Tucker said earlier you know we have the
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
send none of them is going to call upon
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
a will Stewart who's a lobbyist
 
01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:41.420 align:start position:0%
and representing Statewide New Hampshire
 
01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:45.020 align:start position:0%
and he supports the bill
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
Mr Stewart thank you Mr chairman members
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh my name again is
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
Will Stewart I'm the executive director
 
01:08:55.849 --> 01:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
of stay work play New Hampshire which if
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
you're not familiar with it is a
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide non-profit whose mission is to
 
01:09:02.329 --> 01:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
attract and retain more young people
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and uh we are as
 
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in support of this bill
 
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
you know because we believe that you
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
know more options for creating you know
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
more child care availability
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
um is critical to attracting and
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
retaining more young people here in the
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
state and that is very much necessary
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and critical to the future of the
 
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
state right now as you might be aware
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the second oldest state
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
in the country with one of the lowest
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates even you know during
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
covid on top of this we're the number
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
one exporter of high school graduates
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
seeking a four-year degree with some 62
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
percent of these young people leaving
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
the state every year some of them come
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
back but many of them don't
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
um you know in short New Hampshire needs
 
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
all the people we can get in general and
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
all the young people we can get in
 
01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
particular our businesses need workers
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
and customers our towns need volunteer
 
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
board members and our non-profits
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
churches and Civic clubs all need
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
volunteers to accomplish their vital
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
missions without which our communities
 
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
just can't function
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
and you know about three years ago State
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
play We commissioned this survey to
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
collect data on why young people stay in
 
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
and leave New Hampshire and one of the
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
reasons we found was uh you know Child
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
Care available your lack of child care
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
availability and affordability
 
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
um you know as uh representative Fenton

representative
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr Stewart on
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
have this this bill focuses only on tax
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
credits we currently the situation that
 
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
we have is that the finance committee
 
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
puts in the budget uh not enough money
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
to help with the child care situation in
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
the state but it does put some money in
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be better if this
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
committee broadened itself out to
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the most efficient way for
 
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
the state of of on doing more for the
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
child care crisis that we have
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
rather than just focusing on reducing
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
the uh general fund money that can be
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
used for things like child care but also
 
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
substance abuse and a lot of other
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
things that businesses need thank you
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the uh for
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
the question and uh you know I will say
 
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
that you know I think that uh the state
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
should be you know there are lots of
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
things that can and should you know be
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
done to address this issue you this uh
 
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
proposal to study is is one of those you
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
know there's there's no Silver Bullet
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's a uh a complex issue uh to be sure
 
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
if there were an easy fix it would have
 
01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
been fixed a long time ago right
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
um I think this is you know one
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
potential option uh there are certainly
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
others and I would encourage uh the
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
legislature to explore all such Avenues
 
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
to address this uh this very real
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman yes
 
01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
I would like permission to to try to
 
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
Fashion an amendment that would make
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
this a study of the most efficient way
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
of dealing with this problem
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.430 align:start position:0%

um okay
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
what is your study Amendment going to be
 
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
that'll be different from this this is
 
01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:49.729 align:start position:0%
that'll be different from this this is
creating

01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
creating
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's creating a committee only to look
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
at tax credits on the business taxes in
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
order to to promote Child Care needs to
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
employees I do not know and I think
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
people on the finance committee could
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
help us figure out on
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
which way that way or the way they're
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
doing now or some other way that the
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
child care people can think of on would
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
be the the best way to direct funding
 
01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:29.420 align:start position:0%
towards this really important need
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
and uh why don't you go ahead and get
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%

make our government efficient enough to
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
live with low taxes we have to look at
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%

may be worth more than a thousand words
 
01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:42.530 align:start position:0%
may be worth more than a thousand words
but

01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:43.490 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna assume you've looked
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
at my testimony and you may recall the
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
that that graphic that I'll now describe
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
you know it it basically shows that
 
01:29:58.850 --> 01:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
under the current law we have uh two
 
01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
streams of money that are flowing
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
directly into uh our dedicated funds for
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence programs uh the two
 
01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
are a well-established stream from the
 
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
marriage licenses which seems to be a a
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
pretty predictable Revenue stream
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
although it's not cut in stone it's it's
 
01:30:22.729 --> 01:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
got a a historical behavior that looks
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
to add about three hundred and sixty
 
01:30:27.169 --> 01:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh in the next budget
 
01:30:27.179 --> 01:30:29.090 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh in the next budget
the

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
um New stream is from the marriage
 
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
officiate license that we passed last
 
01:30:37.729 --> 01:30:37.739 align:start position:0%
term and because it's new we don't
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
really have a history with it but upon
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
looking at other states around us and
 
01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
and and how those streams have come in
 
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
we've had smart people put together
 
01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:51.900 align:start position:0%
their best guesstimate that a hundred
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
and twenty two thousand will be brought
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
from that so if you take the 360 for
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
marriage license and accept 122 is a
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
good estimate for
 
01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.950 align:start position:0%
good estimate for
um

01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
um the marriage officiate uh that that
 
01:31:09.729 --> 01:31:09.739 align:start position:0%
comes in at
 
01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
482 thousand dollars that's the amount
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
that the governor's budget
 
01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.410 align:start position:0%
that the governor's budget
reflects

01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
reflects
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
um I provided an abstract of the
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
governor's budget in my written
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
testimony as well so that those of you
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
who like to see hard things have it in
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
front of you when you want to look at it
 
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
so what my bill does and more
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
importantly my amendment I really want
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
you to focus on my Amendment and not the
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
underlying bill because the amendment
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
improves it so much
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
what it does is it takes the uncertainty
 
01:31:49.729 --> 01:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
out of the funding stream that goes into
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund it takes the
 
01:31:55.689 --> 01:31:55.699 align:start position:0%
uncertainty out because
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
I'm committing to you that the general
 
01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
fund will put that full 482 thousand
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
dollars that's reflected in the
 
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
governor's budget into the dedicated
 
01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:08.689 align:start position:0%
governor's budget into the dedicated
fund

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:11.699 align:start position:0%
and the money that comes from the
 
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
license fees will instead go to the
 
01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
general fund so for the purposes of the
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
general fund it's a wash
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
and and and why is it wash a wash or why
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
is it worth doing the wash
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
I I think it's worth doing the wash
 
01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
because we have solid we have dirtied
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
the the reputation of the institution of
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
marriage because we have a state policy
 
01:32:39.239 --> 01:32:40.370 align:start position:0%
marriage because we have a state policy
we've

01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
pretended that the act of marriage
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
creates a or has a Nexus to the creation
 
01:32:51.169 --> 01:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
of additional domestic violence
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
and I think that Nexus that Assumption
 
01:32:58.689 --> 01:32:58.699 align:start position:0%
of a Nexus is wrong and it's insulting
 
01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:02.219 align:start position:0%
uh and that the better way to go is to
 
01:33:06.649 --> 01:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
find a more relevant more correct Nexus
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
for a set of special funds to be
 
01:33:09.719 --> 01:33:11.209 align:start position:0%
for a set of special funds to be
dedicated

01:33:11.209 --> 01:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
so what I would like us to do is to take
 
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
this two-year budget as a transition
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
that is the chair of division three
 
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
Finance I have some influence over
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
ensuring that this domestic violence
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
fund is fully paid for that's my
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
commitment to you it's a commitment in
 
01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
writing it's a commitment to to you
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
personally that I will hold
 
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget request of 482
 
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
000 that money will go under the
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund and for people who want
 
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
to know why this dedicated fund funding
 
01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
is so important it's because
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
General funds lapse at the end of every
 
01:33:58.570 --> 01:33:58.580 align:start position:0%
budget the dedicated fund is a
 
01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing account and by putting money
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
into this non-lapsing account it will
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
give the managers of the domestic
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
violence program the more flexibility to
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
ensure continuous flow of the contracts
 
01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
right now as I understand it there are
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
very few contracts that this money pays
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
for I believe it may be just one uh to a
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
particular uh organization here in New
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I want to assure the
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
leadership of that Coalition that I am
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
committing here to make sure that that
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund is fully funded
 
01:34:36.239 --> 01:34:37.610 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund is fully funded
so

01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:39.169 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:34:39.169 --> 01:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
I think those are my key points uh I say
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
a lot more in my written testimony so I
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
would commend that to you one one thing
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
I would add is I I've also been
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
appointed to the governor's Commission
 
01:34:56.330 --> 01:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
on alcohol and drug abuse prevention
 
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
treatment and recovery and as I'm
 
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
getting up to speed on what that
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
committee does one of the things it does
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
is it recommends the authorizations of
 
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
funds under RSA 12 dash Juliet colon 3.
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
and it authorizes the fund to invest in
 
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
recovery services for individuals and
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
families affected by alcohol and drug
 
01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:21.770 align:start position:0%
families affected by alcohol and drug
abuse

01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
I believe that that may be a much more
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate long-term place to to find
 
01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:30.659 align:start position:0%
the funding into long into the future
 
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
for the domestic violence program
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund
 
01:35:35.639 --> 01:35:36.830 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund
so

01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'll I'll take questions
 
01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
if there are any well thank you for your
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Edwards the
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um it's always
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
good to hear from you
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm actually glad you did this but I
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I understand
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
um did you have any
 
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
um influence in on the governor and him
 
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
putting this in his budget this way
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
I would love to pretend the governor
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
calls me and and asks for my advice but
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
he he forgot to call me on this one sir
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay so but you know the straight answer
 
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
is no no sir I didn't make sure I
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
understand then
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
um you're saying that uh so the budget
 
01:36:34.729 --> 01:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
the the the budget that was forwarded to
 
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
the to finance from the governor doesn't
 
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
have does not have this money in it or
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
or does it have this money in it already
 
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
it absolutely does and that's why I
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
included the abstract in your written
 
01:36:49.729 --> 01:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
testimony that I provided it shows the
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh the the cut out of the governor's
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
budget and and in the governor's budget
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
you'll see 482
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
000 and change like something like 650
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
bucks four four eight two six five two
 
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
something like that that's the
 
01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:10.340 align:start position:0%
governor's projection for
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds and there are only two
 
01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
sources of dedicated funds one is the
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
marriage officiate license excuse me the
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
marriage license where if you look at it
 
01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
historically it's it it brings in
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
anywhere from three hundred and fifty
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to to 365
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
000 and and so I just for estimation
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
personal purposes I put 360. and so that
 
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
means that the balance from the
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate and
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
um and historical is about a hundred and
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
twenty two thousand which I assume is
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
related to their estimates for the
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
marriage officiate uh slice of the
 
01:37:54.239 --> 01:37:55.070 align:start position:0%
marriage officiate uh slice of the
license

01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:37:58.370 --> 01:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
okay just a follow-up please follow up
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
so so okay so I follow what's going on
 
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
and basically instead of the
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh these well first of all let's start
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
with the marriage license fifty dollar
 
01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
marriage license the clerk of the Town
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
clerkeeps seven dollars the rest was
 
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
um the special fund
 
01:38:16.729 --> 01:38:16.739 align:start position:0%
instead it's going to go to the general
 
01:38:16.739 --> 01:38:17.810 align:start position:0%
instead it's going to go to the general
fund

01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
and then the thing we passed last year
 
01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:22.139 align:start position:0%
the special officiant license which is
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
85 dollars for out of state people
 
01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
coming in to officiate a marriage
 
01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:29.179 align:start position:0%
of which five dollars still goes to the
 
01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State but the remainder
 
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
goes and now instead of the special fund
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
it goes into the general fund is that
 
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.350 align:start position:0%
it goes into the general fund is that
correct

01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
this is your Amendment that's under
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
current law yes sir
 
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
and my recommendation is to have that
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
money put into the general fund directly
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
your amendment has both of those now
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
instead of going to the Department of
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
Human Services special fund
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 173 B15 it goes into the general
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
fund of both of those the the 43 dollars
 
01:39:00.530 --> 01:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
per marriage license goes into the
 
01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
general fund and the
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh eighty dollar eighty dollars for the
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
special officiant goes into the uh
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
general fund so basically it's it's it's
 
01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
going to the general fund
 
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
and and then what what what has to what
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying is for finance is going to
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
have to rely you're gonna have to rely
 
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
on finance every budget cycle to make
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
sure it continues to fund
 
01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:26.689 align:start position:0%
sure it continues to fund
this

01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
um domestic violence is that correct I
 
01:39:31.729 --> 01:39:31.739 align:start position:0%
want to uh explore your use of the word
 
01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
every budget cycle every I am saying uh
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
this this is a bridge to use General
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
funds for this next budget
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
but I will come back in August to OLS so
 
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
that we can look at it in January I will
 
01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
find a better source of dedicated funds
 
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
and so I'll be back next year I hope
 
01:39:59.810 --> 01:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
with another bill to identify a source
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
of dedicated funds so that we no longer
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
rely on this the Nexus of marriage but
 
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
we rely on a different Nexus and right
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
now my
 
01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
best guess is to use alcohol commission
 
01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
money in the budget years that follow
 
01:40:19.370 --> 01:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
the one we're about to to do
 
01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:22.139 align:start position:0%
so so I need a bridge
 
01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
of one budget to to get us in the
 
01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
long-term position and I would ask that
 
01:40:32.209 --> 01:40:32.219 align:start position:0%
you trust that I mean I really intend to
 
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
do this okay so thank you I'll let
 
01:40:37.450 --> 01:40:37.460 align:start position:0%
others uh that's now thank you
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative software uh thank you Mr
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:43.790 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
um could you say a little bit more about
 
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
the power of your Amendment
 
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
um the reason I ask is my experience is
 
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
once things get to finance it gets very
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
tricky about what gets cut what gets
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
approved and so on and I really want
 
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:01.739 align:start position:0%
certainty for domestic violence programs
 
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
and that's what they've had of course in
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
the past so it's hard for me to kind of
 
01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
trust in a broad sense uh what might
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
happen in the future thank you
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question and it's I
 
01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a fair one
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
um so far Finance has received four
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
bills that uh were explicitly intended
 
01:41:29.090 --> 01:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
to have money from the general fund
 
01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
appropriated to a range of different
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
um activities and uh the approach of the
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
finance committee has been to discuss
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
them we view them all fairly positively
 
01:41:45.649 --> 01:41:45.659 align:start position:0%
in general I think but and we're going
 
01:41:47.209 --> 01:41:47.219 align:start position:0%
to retain them we're going to retain
 
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
them so that we can see what ways and
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
means you may know that Ways and Means
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
has to provide us with the with the
 
01:41:55.330 --> 01:41:55.340 align:start position:0%
revenue estimate
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
and so when we get the revenue estimate
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
we can start taking a look at the
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and hb2 much more
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
closely to determine how much room we
 
01:42:10.010 --> 01:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
have to maneuver but I'm I'm I I
 
01:42:13.129 --> 01:42:13.139 align:start position:0%
understand that as the chair of division
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
three Finance
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
which controls the DHHS budget as a
 
01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
component Committee of Finance overall I
 
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
understand that historically
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
the the chair of that division three has
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
had a lot of influence on making sure
 
01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
that some funds are are protected and
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
others may be not protected and I am
 
01:42:41.050 --> 01:42:41.060 align:start position:0%
giving you 100 percent my commitment
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Southward that I will
 
01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
protect the general funds sourcing of
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
the total amount of the governor's
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
budget into this dedicated fund you have
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
that as my deepest most solemn promise
 
01:42:59.930 --> 01:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
that may not mean much to you but it
 
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question sir
 
01:43:08.109 --> 01:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
you're on mute
 
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I
 
01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
I just again really want to know more
 
01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.570 align:start position:0%
I just again really want to know more
about

01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
um the power of an amendment like this
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
in finance and I think you know it
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
really depends on what's happening with
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
the economy and a lot of other factors
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
from my perspective and I don't really
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
want domestic violence uh funding at
 
01:43:30.649 --> 01:43:30.659 align:start position:0%
risk because of what's happening in
 
01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
other areas thank you yes sir if I could
 
01:43:35.930 --> 01:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
just um Mr chair could I just add
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
something on to that sure
 
01:43:42.169 --> 01:43:42.179 align:start position:0%
um okay given that this is a wash
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
through the general funds meaning that
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
under current law the the the 482
 
01:43:49.729 --> 01:43:49.739 align:start position:0%
000 approximately was intended to go
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
direct directly to the direct the
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund given that in my
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm just saying let's put that
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
money into the general funds and have
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
the general funds do the appropriation
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
from there I I think that's a very solid
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
argument that most people in finance
 
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
would go okay well it's new money going
 
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
to an Old Source you know let's let's
 
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
let's let's keep the governor's promise
 
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
Susan you you're murdered
 
01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:29.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.619 --> 01:44:36.050 align:start position:0%
 
somebody

01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
completely muted me
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
um well we were gone
 
01:44:40.739 --> 01:44:41.570 align:start position:0%
um well we were gone
um

01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I understand I I
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
fully believe in your
 
01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
assumption that your assumption is that
 
01:44:55.370 --> 01:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
you can control this process in finance
 
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
and in Senate Finance on I have seen a
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
lot of cases when a division Chief has
 
01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
been overruled by the uh
 
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
the head of Finance because of the needs
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
of of the state elsewhere
 
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.669 align:start position:0%
of of the state elsewhere
on

01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I have certainly and you you have
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
too seen times when the Senate Finance
 
01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.010 align:start position:0%
too seen times when the Senate Finance
rearranged

01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
rearranged
 
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
the deck chairs and then just sat on
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
them and said we're not moving
 
01:45:34.199 --> 01:45:35.870 align:start position:0%
them and said we're not moving
so

01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:38.689 --> 01:45:38.699 align:start position:0%
I am very concerned the reason that it
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
is a dedicated fund was to provide
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
certainty for domestic violence when
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
they had been getting less and more and
 
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
less and more on at at different times
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it does support as you know and I
 
01:45:55.129 --> 01:45:55.139 align:start position:0%
know that you have been following
 
01:45:59.689 --> 01:45:59.699 align:start position:0%
domestic violence problems on that on
 
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of agencies depending on
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
this and a lot of people depending on
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
those agencies around the state
 
01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:08.629 align:start position:0%
those agencies around the state
on

01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
I also am worried as to if you protected
 
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
this and the governor put in his budget
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
the money that was estimated for the
 
01:46:20.209 --> 01:46:20.219 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund to come from the
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund so on I'm worried that
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
you might in order to protect this have
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the child care allocation
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
which we've just been talking about how
 
01:46:35.209 --> 01:46:35.219 align:start position:0%
important Child Care is to the economy
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
of the state on or a number of other
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
things that that
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
we take care of
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm also worried because on we could
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
have a relapse because of covet variance
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
into another recession that the governor
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
would have to be cutting and last time
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
he cut every new program in order to
 
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
produce the Surplus that he got
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
or reduce the deficit quite a lot
 
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:11.330 align:start position:0%
or reduce the deficit quite a lot
so

01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm quite worried about taking this
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
out of dedicated fund status I know that
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
you have a major
 
01:47:24.410 --> 01:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
personal moral objection to this the way
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
it is funded
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
now but I wish that you could
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
delay a little and come with your
 
01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:36.179 align:start position:0%
Alternate Source which if it is from the
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
alcohol commission is probably going to
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
take money away from substance abuse
 
01:47:44.689 --> 01:47:44.699 align:start position:0%
treatment and prevention which is at
 
01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
least has been the the
 
01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
reason for the alcohol Commission which
 
01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
has been going since then Senator Gordon
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
got it set up 20 years 25 years ago
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
something like that thank you
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
do you have what do you feel you really
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
feel that you can control us into the
 
01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:07.070 align:start position:0%
feel that you can control us into the
future

01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.510 align:start position:0%
future
so

01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
um I I will admit that I I don't know
 
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
what I don't know and I have not
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
experienced the opportunity to be on
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
finance or to be a chair of division
 
01:48:23.209 --> 01:48:23.219 align:start position:0%
three so this is very new I think your
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
concerns are are are are valid for the
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
most part I have had a couple of good
 
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
discussions with the chair of Finance to
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
let him know what I was doing and what I
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
was thinking and that I can assure you
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
that the chair of Finance is not
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
surprised by this and is a voiced
 
01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
support for this endeavor
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
um uh I I think I would go back to uh
 
01:48:51.530 --> 01:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
one thing you said about the alcohol
 
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
commission and I have so much to learn
 
01:48:56.209 --> 01:48:56.219 align:start position:0%
there but it's my understanding that uh
 
01:48:59.330 --> 01:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
five percent of the net profits were
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to go
 
01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
be available for a range of expenses and
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's in less than those five
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
percentage points have been brought over
 
01:49:15.410 --> 01:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
under the alcohol commission and that a
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
greater percentage of that five
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
percentage points is meant to come over
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
so it's like that fund is getting some
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
new money and I'm I am not
 
01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.590 align:start position:0%
new money and I'm I am not
um

01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
I would want to just point out to you
 
01:49:29.639 --> 01:49:31.310 align:start position:0%
I would want to just point out to you
that

01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:34.250 --> 01:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm not creating a new line or a new
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
justification to spend money from that
 
01:49:40.270 --> 01:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
commission RSA 12 dash Juliet colon 3
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
already says that money can be spent on
 
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
Recovery Services for individuals and
 
01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
families affected by alcohol and drug
 
01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:49.250 align:start position:0%
families affected by alcohol and drug
abuse

01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
so so the responding to the horrors of
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence with the
 
01:49:58.850 --> 01:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
alcohol money I think is perfectly in
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
line with the original intent and the
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
legislative words of that statute so so
 
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not a hard fight it's
 
01:50:09.530 --> 01:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
sir everything's a fight but I that's
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
not a hard one I don't think
 
01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:19.669 align:start position:0%
not a hard one I don't think
foreign

01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:21.169 --> 01:50:21.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:50:24.729 --> 01:50:24.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
know all the respect again
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
um why we why do we even have to deal
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
with this bill because it sounds like
 
01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
it's going to be an hb2
 
01:50:38.209 --> 01:50:38.219 align:start position:0%
uh it sounds like the governor in hb2 is
 
01:50:40.129 --> 01:50:40.139 align:start position:0%
making these proposals
 
01:50:42.410 --> 01:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh to have the money come out of the
 
01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
general fund and have these marriage
 
01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
license fees going into the general fund
 
01:50:52.609 --> 01:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
uh so even if we pass this bill
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
the Senate has to pass it to become law
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime you and finance have
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
to produce your budget by the first week
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
of April
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
so and you'll be voting on in the floor
 
01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
we'll be voting on the floor on on the
 
01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:11.570 align:start position:0%
we'll be voting on the floor on on the
budget

01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so I'm assuming that before this
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
becomes law it's going to be in the
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
budget that's going to we're going to be
 
01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
voting on
 
01:51:21.129 --> 01:51:21.139 align:start position:0%
so why do we need to act on this bill
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
in all the respect I'm really trying to
 
01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.410 align:start position:0%
in all the respect I'm really trying to
understand

01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
I appreciate what you're trying to do
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
here just so you know
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
um but this is more of a procedural
 
01:51:32.450 --> 01:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
question than anything else
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
so if I led you to believe that the
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
is going to say in hb2 that the these
 
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund sources for marriage will
 
01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:45.530 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund sources for marriage will
go

01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh to the general fund then I misspoke
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
we've not seen hp2 and I don't I have no
 
01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
reason to think that the governor will
 
01:51:59.930 --> 01:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
do what this amendment does okay then I
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
missed it totally I thought I'm sure I
 
01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:05.050 align:start position:0%
missed it totally I thought I'm sure I
miscommunicated

01:52:05.050 --> 01:52:05.060 align:start position:0%
miscommunicated
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
that the governor's budget the budget
 
01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:09.290 align:start position:0%
that the governor's budget the budget
hb1

01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
has 400 and whatever 82
 
01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:14.050 align:start position:0%
has 400 and whatever 82
000

01:52:14.050 --> 01:52:14.060 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:52:17.090 --> 01:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
in the general fund out of the general
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
fund to pay for domestic violence is
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
that was I mistaken in hearing that I I
 
01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
was mistaken if I said that I I to
 
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
clarify if you look at the abstract of
 
01:52:30.890 --> 01:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget it shows
 
01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:32.570 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget it shows
um

01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
let me call it up just to make sure I
 
01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:43.629 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:52:43.629 --> 01:52:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
item for agency income there is a number
 
01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:50.770 align:start position:0%
item for agency income there is a number
there

01:52:50.770 --> 01:52:50.780 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:52.750 align:start position:0%
there
482

01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
482
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
459 dollars for each of the two fiscal
 
01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:58.250 align:start position:0%
459 dollars for each of the two fiscal
years

01:52:58.250 --> 01:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
that is a number that I'm sure is made
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
up of two things I'm it's a guess but
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure
 
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
one is the long-standing historic
 
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
funding source from marriage licenses
 
01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.530 align:start position:0%
funding source from marriage licenses
Plus

01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
Plus
 
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
a guesstimate of how much money will
 
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
come in under the marriage officiate
 
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
Bill those are dedicated funds sources
 
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
under the governor's hb2 or it'll
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
probably be silent on it since it's
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
already existing law uh but but what I'm
 
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
proposing is to is to not go forward
 
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
under current law I want this amendment
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
to change the current law so that those
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
two sources go into the general fund and
 
01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:46.940 align:start position:0%
the general fund for one budget term
 
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
pays for
 
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
pays into that dedicated fund
 
01:53:56.209 --> 01:53:56.219 align:start position:0%
and that one budget will give me time to
 
01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
come back and say Here's a much better
 
01:53:58.380 --> 01:53:59.689 align:start position:0%
come back and say Here's a much better
source

01:53:59.689 --> 01:53:59.699 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
for funding this domestic violence uh
 
01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
appropriation as a as a childhood
 
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
Survivor of domestic violence I want
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
these accounts funded fully I think
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
these are vital programs
 
01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
but in our family the act of marriage
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
saved our family
 
01:54:23.689 --> 01:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
it was the abuse of alcohol that caused
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
the havoc and the chaos and so
 
01:54:29.209 --> 01:54:29.219 align:start position:0%
I react
 
01:54:29.219 --> 01:54:31.070 align:start position:0%
I react
probably

01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
more viscerally than most people when I
 
01:54:36.890 --> 01:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
look to see that as state policy
 
01:54:39.649 --> 01:54:39.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is in the position of
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
offending the institution of marriage
 
01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
while letting alcohol abuse off
 
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
scot-free and I want to fix that because
 
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
I believe the messages that we send as a
 
01:54:56.209 --> 01:54:56.219 align:start position:0%
state legislature at some level matter
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative Edwards I I you know
 
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
I agreed with you last term in the term
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
before on this issue uh but uh but I I'm
 
01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
just it's a procedural question we do
 
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
have the governor's budget uh person in
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
with us tomorrow
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
will Probe on this one to see what hit
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
the intention of the of the governor was
 
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
about the 482 million uh a thousand
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
dollars a year uh going forward over you
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
know for the next two years anyway
 
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
yes sir go from there I think we'll have
 
01:55:26.689 --> 01:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
a little more knowledge after tomorrow's
 
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
meeting with the governor's budget
 
01:55:30.729 --> 01:55:30.739 align:start position:0%
fellow uh director
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
represented an engine and
 
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
um representative Edwards in in
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
principle I uh this uh uh bill is new to
 
01:55:45.169 --> 01:55:45.179 align:start position:0%
me being new to Ways and Means so in
 
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
general I look at this I I agree with
 
01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to accomplish here it
 
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
makes sense not to make it look like
 
01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
marriage is is the offending situation
 
01:55:57.410 --> 01:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
in the alcohol fund does make sense to
 
01:55:57.420 --> 01:55:58.609 align:start position:0%
in the alcohol fund does make sense to
me

01:55:58.609 --> 01:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:56:01.490 --> 01:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
um why not to I've heard a lot of
 
01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:03.659 align:start position:0%
uncertainty expressed from different
 
01:56:03.659 --> 01:56:05.330 align:start position:0%
uncertainty expressed from different
Representatives

01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
um as and we none of us can predict the
 
01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
future so why not come back with an
 
01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
amendment on this where you where you
 
01:56:16.129 --> 01:56:16.139 align:start position:0%
introduce you know kind of swap out so
 
01:56:18.169 --> 01:56:18.179 align:start position:0%
to speak the marriage
 
01:56:22.010 --> 01:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
um fee with an alcohol fee and that way
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go through multiple
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
steps to get there and you can eliminate
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty that many are concerned
 
01:56:27.119 --> 01:56:28.609 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty that many are concerned
with

01:56:28.609 --> 01:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:56:30.649 --> 01:56:30.659 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
um because you were not in Ways and
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
Means last term you were spared the two
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
or three times where I I held forth on
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
this issue uh in a in front of a very
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
patient committee
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
um in August uh when we were had our
 
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
bill period opened
 
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I had no clue if I was going to get
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
reelected let alone uh get the
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
assignments that I've received so I put
 
01:56:59.450 --> 01:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
a bill in in August to keep this issue
 
01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:00.470 align:start position:0%
a bill in in August to keep this issue
alive

01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
alive
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
and it was after my assignments and
 
01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
after some committee meetings where I
 
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
thought oh man there's a lot cleaner way
 
01:57:13.129 --> 01:57:13.139 align:start position:0%
to do this than what my underlying Bill
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
36 346 did so I submitted an amendment
 
01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
that would make 346 cleaner and easier
 
01:57:24.649 --> 01:57:24.659 align:start position:0%
and get rid of an extraneous idea now
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
you're if you are as a committee uh
 
01:57:32.570 --> 01:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
wanting to kill 346 and the amendment
 
01:57:33.850 --> 01:57:33.860 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:57:37.129 --> 01:57:37.139 align:start position:0%
I'll just keep coming back I'll figure
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
out more I'll I I will work this until
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'm convinced that I've been able to
 
01:57:46.729 --> 01:57:46.739 align:start position:0%
convince enough people that this is a is
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
a good and right thing to do and that
 
01:57:54.530 --> 01:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:58.729 --> 01:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker
 
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
yes I I too find that the idea of fixing
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
something that's not broken
 
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
is very hard to understand what we do
 
01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
know is that it appears that the
 
01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
incidences of domestic violence have
 
01:58:21.050 --> 01:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
risen during the pandemic as people uh
 
01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
are forced to spend a lot more time with
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
each other which sometimes unfortunately
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
does lead to violence and abuse of
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
various kinds whether physical or verbal
 
01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.390 align:start position:0%
various kinds whether physical or verbal
psychological

01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
psychological
 
01:58:38.689 --> 01:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
this doesn't seem to be the time to be
 
01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.410 --> 01:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
into an unknown we know that domestic
 
01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
violence is a problem right now that
 
01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
it's a rising problem in the pandemic I
 
01:58:55.970 --> 01:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
don't believe this is the time to have a
 
01:58:58.250 --> 01:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
change let's leave well enough alone
 
01:59:01.370 --> 01:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
make sure that this program has funding
 
01:59:03.530 --> 01:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
that there's no temptation
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
once it's in the general fund not to
 
01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
spend it because
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
it we are facing many uncertainties
 
01:59:15.290 --> 01:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
let's leave certainty in the funding of
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
domestic violence if you're able to
 
01:59:21.609 --> 01:59:21.619 align:start position:0%
identify a better Source another year
 
01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
I think that's fine then we can just one
 
01:59:25.139 --> 01:59:27.050 align:start position:0%
I think that's fine then we can just one
question

01:59:27.050 --> 01:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
well I want to know how you react to
 
01:59:29.639 --> 01:59:30.649 align:start position:0%
well I want to know how you react to
that

01:59:30.649 --> 01:59:30.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:34.609 --> 01:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
I react by saying that a major part of
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
what you said in your question to me is
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
not relevant to the amendment I've put
 
01:59:45.010 --> 01:59:45.020 align:start position:0%
before you my Amendment fully 100
 
01:59:49.370 --> 01:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
funds domestic violence programs uh I
 
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
think in a way it's better than the
 
01:59:54.609 --> 01:59:54.619 align:start position:0%
current law because the current law
 
01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
assumes approximately 122 000 for
 
02:00:01.250 --> 02:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
marriage officiates uh licenses that we
 
02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's coming in and I'm
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
offering you a guarantee of fully
 
02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
funding this at the governor's level and
 
02:00:10.669 --> 02:00:10.679 align:start position:0%
so I just don't want anyone to miss here
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
and think that I want anything to do
 
02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
with cutting domestic violence programs
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
because I do not I want them fully
 
02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
funded so um so to your other point
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
though about it not being broken that's
 
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
a difference of value systems my value
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
system says it's broken yours does not
 
02:00:31.679 --> 02:00:32.330 align:start position:0%
system says it's broken yours does not
um

02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
and that's that's okay that's why you
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
know we all get elected to come
 
02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.570 --> 02:00:43.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.410 --> 02:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:46.490 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:49.340 align:start position:0%
good morning representative Edwards
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh so this question relates to the
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion that this program domestic
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
violence program
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh might better be funded from the
 
02:01:00.119 --> 02:01:02.030 align:start position:0%
uh might better be funded from the
alcohol

02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:03.410 align:start position:0%
alcohol
fund

02:01:03.410 --> 02:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
my question to you is
 
02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
is this do you have information on the
 
02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
proportion of domestic violence
 
02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:22.820 align:start position:0%
that is occasioned by
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse or more broadly substance
 
02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.729 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse or more broadly substance
abuse

02:01:28.729 --> 02:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
so so that's a great question and I
 
02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time on the national and
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
local websites trying to look for
 
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
statistics of different types in a
 
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
statistic I wanted to validate was what
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
I heard in Health and Human Services two
 
02:01:49.729 --> 02:01:49.739 align:start position:0%
terms ago that 70 percent seven zero
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
percent of all domestic violence occurs
 
02:01:55.129 --> 02:01:55.139 align:start position:0%
between unmarried Partners unfortunately
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
on the website they only use the term of
 
02:02:01.250 --> 02:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
our intimate partners and make no effort
 
02:02:05.410 --> 02:02:05.420 align:start position:0%
to distinguish between marriage and and
 
02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:07.270 align:start position:0%
to distinguish between marriage and and
unmarried

02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
unmarried
 
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
domesticated couples so so so that was
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
once that I really wanted to bring in
 
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
here that's kind of buried and not
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
exposed on the websites the the but to
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
your specific question uh I also was
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
looking to see
 
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
um if there was sort of a breakdown of
 
02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
factors that lead to domestic violence
 
02:02:31.490 --> 02:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know in my mind I was thinking well
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a pie chart out there
 
02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere that says you know X percent
 
02:02:39.649 --> 02:02:39.659 align:start position:0%
is related to drug abuse y percent is
 
02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
related to illegal drug abuse uh
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
another percent is related to
 
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
um you know couples not having good role
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
models to follow in in their teen years
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know I but but there are those I
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
can't find those statistics and when I I
 
02:03:02.209 --> 02:03:02.219 align:start position:0%
when I got called about two weeks ago
 
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
from a national lobbyist I asked her for
 
02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
help finding these statistics and she
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
said she'd call me back and and that
 
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
just hasn't happened yet so I I uh I
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
don't know I I can just tell you in my
 
02:03:19.250 --> 02:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
personal experience
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
um both as a young man and as a company
 
02:03:25.729 --> 02:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
commander in the army that the domestic
 
02:03:29.530 --> 02:03:29.540 align:start position:0%
violence that I've seen is
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
predominantly related to uh uh an
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
incident following alcohol abuse
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
and um and I don't have the stats to
 
02:03:42.649 --> 02:03:42.659 align:start position:0%
back it up other than life experience so
 
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
um so I'm sorry I can't do better than
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
that representative Banks
 
02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
okay let's leave it there thank you
 
02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:54.410 align:start position:0%
okay let's leave it there thank you
representative

02:03:54.410 --> 02:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative major I think you'd
 
02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for taking my
 
02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:59.810 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for taking my
questions

02:03:59.810 --> 02:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
um I do happen to have a pie chart of uh
 
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
victims relationships to their abuser uh
 
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
the the largest category is the spouse
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
category and
 
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
um I think we should acknowledge that
 
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
there are other relationships beside
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
besides intimate
 
02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.570 align:start position:0%
besides intimate
um

02:04:20.570 --> 02:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
where the abusers are not the intimate
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
partner they can be the father mother
 
02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
brother sister cousin
 
02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:29.089 align:start position:0%
brother sister cousin
roommate

02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
roommate
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah so there's a lot of different
 
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
categories but the largest category is
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
the spouse
 
02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:36.050 align:start position:0%
the spouse
um

02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
my question though is do you know of any
 
02:04:41.689 --> 02:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
complaints from people that are
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
purchasing their marriage license about
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
where they're forty three dollars is
 
02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:46.970 align:start position:0%
where they're forty three dollars is
going

02:04:46.970 --> 02:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
no but I think that's because people
 
02:04:52.609 --> 02:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
have no clue and I would love it if you
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
would please provide your statistics
 
02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
with me because I I'm telling you I have
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
been trying for a year to get my hands
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
on statistics that would I will answer
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
that I'll email that too it would be
 
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
great I'd also be interested in who
 
02:05:09.890 --> 02:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
emailed it to you but but that's the
 
02:05:12.169 --> 02:05:12.179 align:start position:0%
different issue well it's the
 
02:05:15.169 --> 02:05:15.179 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Coalition of domestic
 
02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
violence and I believe there's an
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
attendee that wants to speak as well
 
02:05:22.609 --> 02:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
maybe they could raise their hand
 
02:05:25.129 --> 02:05:25.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
so I would add that I've not been
 
02:05:30.530 --> 02:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
contacted by the Coalition and I did I
 
02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
did do an Outreach effort through a
 
02:05:34.729 --> 02:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
friend of a friend
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I I wanted to talk to them before
 
02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:38.030 align:start position:0%
um I I wanted to talk to them before
today

02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:41.990 align:start position:0%
today
okay

02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:44.930 --> 02:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
um representative element
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you on basically I just wanted to
 
02:05:51.649 --> 02:05:51.659 align:start position:0%
clarify something for representative
 
02:05:54.770 --> 02:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
abrami representative Edwards uh isn't
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
it true that in the governor's budget
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
that uh 500 and whatever 400 and
 
02:06:05.209 --> 02:06:05.219 align:start position:0%
whatever it is uh is uh going to show up
 
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
as other funds
 
02:06:10.609 --> 02:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
mainly that is coming from dedicated
 
02:06:13.010 --> 02:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
funds and his budget contains all
 
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
spending whether it's from dedicated
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
funds or other or the highway fund or
 
02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.109 align:start position:0%
funds or other or the highway fund or
whatever

02:06:20.109 --> 02:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:23.089 --> 02:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and I I've tried to agree with
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
that two or three times and the graphic
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
is posted in my written testimony
 
02:06:31.729 --> 02:06:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you I I know I just wanted to make
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
sure that uh it was understood by the
 
02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:36.229 align:start position:0%
sure that uh it was understood by the
committee

02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
any further questions for
 
02:06:42.770 --> 02:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
I don't see any thank you for
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
02:06:48.890 --> 02:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
chair and I will continue to listen in
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
case there are further questions for me
 
02:06:54.770 --> 02:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
later thank you okay the next is a
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
Sandra summer who is a member of the
 
02:07:00.649 --> 02:07:00.659 align:start position:0%
public who wishes to testify in our
 
02:07:00.659 --> 02:07:02.330 align:start position:0%
public who wishes to testify in our
position

02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
and I don't see a Sandra Plummer on the
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:10.910 align:start position:0%
 
however

02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:07:13.609 --> 02:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
I believe Pamela English
 
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
is an attendee and wanted to testify but
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
she'll have to raise her hand if that's
 
02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
the case
 
02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay you do not see a Sandra Plum I do
 
02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
not no
 
02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:30.470 align:start position:0%
not no
okay

02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.689 --> 02:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
the one who just mentioned uh she just
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
raised her hand her name is Pamela
 
02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
English and he's from the New Hampshire
 
02:07:40.850 --> 02:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh see you on the list
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
she was not on the list he raised her
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
hand oh boy okay Mr chairman
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
I think if you asked Pamela kalig she
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
would tell you that Sandra Plummer has
 
02:07:59.570 --> 02:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
had a emergency and could not come today
 
02:08:01.729 --> 02:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
and I believe that Pamela English is
 
02:08:01.739 --> 02:08:03.290 align:start position:0%
and I believe that Pamela English is
substituting

02:08:03.290 --> 02:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
substituting
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair uh this is Pamela

yes are you substituting for Sandra
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry but I'm not aware of who
 
02:08:23.330 --> 02:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
Sandra Plummer is I am substituting for
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
our executive director Lynn Chalet who
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
cannot be here today because her father
 
02:08:31.490 --> 02:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
just passed away okay and you
 
02:08:34.729 --> 02:08:34.739 align:start position:0%

02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
so good morning Mr chair and members of
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
the committee I am the administrative
 
02:08:45.410 --> 02:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Coalition
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
against Domestic and Sexual Violence
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
um the Coalition is an umbrella agency
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
for 13 community-based questions in New
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who provide free and
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
confidential services to nearly 15 000
 
02:09:01.199 --> 02:09:02.390 align:start position:0%
confidential services to nearly 15 000
survivors

02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
survivors
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
of sexual and domestic violence every
 
02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.169 align:start position:0%
of sexual and domestic violence every
year

02:09:06.169 --> 02:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
um I thank you again but I'm also uh
 
02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
sorry to hear that representative
 
02:09:12.169 --> 02:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
Edwards has experienced domestic
 
02:09:14.570 --> 02:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
violence in his household growing up
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
this unfortunately is common in our
 
02:09:19.550 --> 02:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
state programs work every day to protect
 
02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
victims and children who are far too
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
often trapped in homes with abuse we're
 
02:09:25.550 --> 02:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
also incredibly grateful to
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for his
 
02:09:29.810 --> 02:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
commitment to providing funding to these
 
02:09:32.810 --> 02:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.129 --> 02:09:34.139 align:start position:0%
just a little about the domestic
 
02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:35.639 align:start position:0%
violence prevention program it was
 
02:09:39.770 --> 02:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
created in 1981 by the legislature and
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
guaranteed a funding source for domestic
 
02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
violence programs
 
02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
the program has supported tens of
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of victims
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence over the last 40
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
years moreover nearly 30 other states
 
02:09:56.930 --> 02:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
provide domestic violence funding
 
02:09:59.890 --> 02:09:59.900 align:start position:0%
through marriage license fees
 
02:10:03.890 --> 02:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
as we talked about currently 43 dollars
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
from marriage licenses and eighty
 
02:10:08.450 --> 02:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
dollars from the new special officiant
 
02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
licensed goes towards the domestic
 
02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
violence prevention program
 
02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
and that will bring nearly five hundred
 
02:10:17.209 --> 02:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars annually that crisis
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
centers can rely on from year to year
 
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
this is also a tax-free way to fund
 
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
these valuable services
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
and although this
 
02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
alternative funding source for domestic
 
02:10:32.089 --> 02:10:32.099 align:start position:0%
violence Services the suggested funding
 
02:10:35.149 --> 02:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
source lacks stability and I'll get to
 
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
more about the amendment but originally
 
02:10:39.169 --> 02:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
there was parking tickets and fines
 
02:10:41.330 --> 02:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
they're not a stable source for domestic
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
violence funding nor is it an adequate
 
02:10:45.229 --> 02:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
replacement for what currently is
 
02:10:45.239 --> 02:10:46.450 align:start position:0%
replacement for what currently is
provided

02:10:46.450 --> 02:10:46.460 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
according to the fiscal note these
 
02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
alternative funding sources would cause
 
02:10:53.149 --> 02:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
programs to experience an almost total
 
02:10:57.229 --> 02:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
loss of funding as a result of the bill
 
02:10:58.729 --> 02:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
so the domestic violence prevention
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
program provides funding for core
 
02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.089 align:start position:0%
program provides funding for core
services

02:11:02.089 --> 02:11:02.099 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:11:04.850 --> 02:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
for victims and their children across
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire these are critical
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
life-saving services including emergency
 
02:11:09.119 --> 02:11:10.669 align:start position:0%
life-saving services including emergency
shelter

02:11:10.669 --> 02:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
shelter
 
02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
services for traumatized children
 
02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
exposed to domestic violence the
 
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
operation of our 24-hour hotlines and
 
02:11:19.810 --> 02:11:19.820 align:start position:0%
allows for trained and confidential
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence Advocates to accompany
 
02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
victims to court proceedings and to
 
02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:26.709 align:start position:0%
victims to court proceedings and to
hospital

02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
visits so it's critical centers can
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
respond with the services they need and
 
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
with a commitment to keeping victims and
 
02:11:38.209 --> 02:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
their children safe unfunded programs
 
02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
should never be the reason a Survivor is
 
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
denied access to safety
 
02:11:46.729 --> 02:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
as you all acknowledged earlier we
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
remain under an unprecedented Global
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic that's created even more
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
barriers for victims of abuse and their
 
02:11:54.599 --> 02:11:55.550 align:start position:0%
barriers for victims of abuse and their
children

02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:11:58.129 --> 02:11:58.139 align:start position:0%
over the last year our crisis Advocates
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
reported that incidents of domestic
 
02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
violence had escalated
 
02:12:06.109 --> 02:12:06.119 align:start position:0%
to alarmingly lethal levels an increased
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
need for survivors to receive immediate
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
interventions just to stay alive
 
02:12:14.330 --> 02:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
crisis centers experienced a 39 percent
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
increase in calls to 24-Hour hotlines
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
receiving nearly 100
 
02:12:23.570 --> 02:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
000 calls for survivors in 2020. that's
 
02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
so Advocates across the state report
 
02:12:29.689 --> 02:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
that the needs of survivors have become
 
02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
more complex as a direct result of the
 
02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:33.410 align:start position:0%
more complex as a direct result of the
pandemic

02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
without the support of our services many
 
02:12:39.649 --> 02:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
victims and their children would remain
 
02:12:39.659 --> 02:12:40.850 align:start position:0%
victims and their children would remain
in

02:12:40.850 --> 02:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
would remain trapped in abusive and
 
02:12:45.229 --> 02:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous homes
 
02:12:47.890 --> 02:12:47.900 align:start position:0%
crisis centers have had to turn away 3
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
500 adults and 2 000 children
 
02:12:56.209 --> 02:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
due to lack of capacity from 2017
 
02:12:56.219 --> 02:12:58.370 align:start position:0%
due to lack of capacity from 2017
2020.

02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
I wanted to talk a little bit about the
 
02:13:01.550 --> 02:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
relationship between a marriage between
 
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
marriage and domestic violence
 
02:13:06.410 --> 02:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
so we understand there's some concerns
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
expressed by the sponsor over the
 
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
funding source and the connection
 
02:13:12.890 --> 02:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
between domestic violence and marriage
 
02:13:15.649 --> 02:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
in preparation for this hearing we were
 
02:13:18.109 --> 02:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
able to analyze data from the last five
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
years which we routinely use in Grant
 
02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:21.950 align:start position:0%
years which we routinely use in Grant
reports

02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
reports
 
02:13:24.649 --> 02:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
according to Statewide data collected by
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
our crisis centers over the last five
 
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
years 27 percent
 
02:13:32.510 --> 02:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
of victims of domestic violence served
 
02:13:34.810 --> 02:13:34.820 align:start position:0%
by our programs were in spousal
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
relationships I believe representative
 
02:13:40.970 --> 02:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
Jenny I'm sorry I don't remember her
 
02:13:43.930 --> 02:13:43.940 align:start position:0%
last name Grimaldo maybe
 
02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
how it was the highest relationship type
 
02:13:50.810 --> 02:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
for reported domestic violence compared
 
02:13:52.669 --> 02:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
to all of the other relationship types
 
02:13:55.010 --> 02:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
and that is true from what we see from
 
02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
our data
 
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh moreover we know that marriage does
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
not cause domestic violence but it does
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
make it a lot harder for some victims to
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
leave because of legal obligations or
 
02:14:10.729 --> 02:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
religious commitment children and Joint
 
02:14:12.770 --> 02:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
assets and debt
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
and it's not surprising that we see more
 
02:14:17.209 --> 02:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
married people seeking help at our
 
02:14:19.729 --> 02:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
crisis centers it's much easier to leave
 
02:14:21.649 --> 02:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
a relationship when you don't have those
 
02:14:21.659 --> 02:14:23.390 align:start position:0%
a relationship when you don't have those
obligations

02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
02:14:26.689 --> 02:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
similarly alcohol does not cause abuse
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
but it can make domestic violence worse
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
Firearms do not cause domestic violence
 
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
but they do make the situation far more
 
02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:37.430 align:start position:0%
but they do make the situation far more
lethal

02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
lethal
 
02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
domestic violence is a choice
 
02:14:42.649 --> 02:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
most abusers do not threaten to kill or
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
slap their bosses or the police officer
 
02:14:49.069 --> 02:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
who pulls them over they can manage
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
their anger they just choose to use
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
violence and threats as a tactic to
 
02:14:58.129 --> 02:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
control and exert power over their
 
02:15:00.649 --> 02:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
partners and kids
 
02:15:04.250 --> 02:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
so we urge this committee to vote HB 346
 
02:15:06.530 --> 02:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and ensure that
 
02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
our state's crisis centers maintain this
 
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
stable source of funding
 
02:15:13.010 --> 02:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
speaking in addition to the sponsors
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment today the state does
 
02:15:19.129 --> 02:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
not provide adequate funding for
 
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
domestic violence Services through the
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
state budget and the funding levels
 
02:15:26.209 --> 02:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
shifted dramatically over the past few
 
02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
budget Cycles
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
the Coalition and all 13 crisis centers
 
02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
would prefer to have this dedicated
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
source of funding over these dollars
 
02:15:39.709 --> 02:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
being issued through the general fund
 
02:15:42.770 --> 02:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
because we've seen Stark fluctuations in
 
02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
the general fund appropriation over the
 
02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
years including one year in recent
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
history when the legislature
 
02:15:50.810 --> 02:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
appropriated little more than two
 
02:15:52.910 --> 02:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:15:55.010 --> 02:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
to domestic violence programming shared
 
02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
by 13 member programs crisis centers
 
02:15:59.330 --> 02:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
serving 15
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
000 15 000 victims that year
 
02:16:05.209 --> 02:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
so while we are extraordinary grateful
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
we are grateful for representative
 
02:16:09.890 --> 02:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
edwards's commitment to increasing
 
02:16:12.890 --> 02:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
general fund dollars as well as the
 
02:16:14.450 --> 02:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
extraordinary leadership of governor
 
02:16:16.430 --> 02:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
sununu and the current legislature's
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
commitment to funding Services we cannot
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
ensure that this will be the will of
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
your legislatures as it has not been in
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
the past
 
02:16:30.589 --> 02:16:30.599 align:start position:0%
victims of crime could certainly use an
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
increase in general fund Appropriations
 
02:16:35.330 --> 02:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
but in addition to our general funding
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
through the marriages which has been
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
used successfully for the past 40 years
 
02:16:42.110 --> 02:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
it is vital that crisis centers have
 
02:16:44.929 --> 02:16:44.939 align:start position:0%
this funding source that they can rely
 
02:16:44.939 --> 02:16:45.950 align:start position:0%
this funding source that they can rely
on

02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so very much and I'm very
 
02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
would you supply the committee a copy of
 
02:16:59.629 --> 02:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:17:03.650 --> 02:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
yes I shall the other question is on my
 
02:17:07.129 --> 02:17:07.139 align:start position:0%
list here I have you listed as opposed
 
02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
would you testifying as opposed
 
02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
but it listed as not testifying
 
02:17:16.849 --> 02:17:16.859 align:start position:0%
it was that a mistake or did you
 
02:17:19.490 --> 02:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
actually put down you're not going to
 
02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
actually put down you're not going to
testify

02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
uh it's quite possible that originally
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
we put me down as not testifying but
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
again our our executive director
 
02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh my boss Lynn Chalet who was going to
 
02:17:36.589 --> 02:17:36.599 align:start position:0%
testify when was unable to do so because
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
the um her father passed away yesterday
 
02:17:42.349 --> 02:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
okay that explains it thank you thank
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
you would provide us that testimony it
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated
 
02:17:50.450 --> 02:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
I I intend to email that to you shortly
 
02:17:50.460 --> 02:17:52.849 align:start position:0%
I I intend to email that to you shortly
representative

02:17:52.849 --> 02:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:55.370 --> 02:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
02:17:58.009 --> 02:17:58.019 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things beyond the 500 000
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
um I was curious in Broad terms what
 
02:18:07.610 --> 02:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
your other funding were uh sources were
 
02:18:09.410 --> 02:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:18:11.330 --> 02:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
um are any of these things eligible for
 
02:18:14.450 --> 02:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
matching funds thank you
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:17.690 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
representative

02:18:17.690 --> 02:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
um we do have some federal funding
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
through the violence against women act
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
and through the victims crime Act
 
02:18:29.089 --> 02:18:29.099 align:start position:0%
and through the federal family Vines
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
prevention and services Act
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
but uh you mentioned match
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
those Federal sources require a match in
 
02:18:43.610 --> 02:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
order us for us to receive them and uh
 
02:18:46.009 --> 02:18:46.019 align:start position:0%
they're as much as 25 of the federal
 
02:18:48.530 --> 02:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
funds and we use the domestic Advanced
 
02:18:51.410 --> 02:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
prevention program because it is state
 
02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
general fund dollars as well as the
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
marriage license fees
 
02:18:57.290 --> 02:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh for the match
 
02:19:00.530 --> 02:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
for those programs so that's another
 
02:19:02.929 --> 02:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
very strong argument to keep marriage
 
02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
license fees uh as a stable source of
 
02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:07.019 align:start position:0%
funding for the domestic violence
 
02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
prevention program
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you a quick follow-up follow-up so
 
02:19:14.509 --> 02:19:14.519 align:start position:0%
just an estimate of your total expenses
 
02:19:18.770 --> 02:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.969 --> 02:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
full expenses
 
02:19:19.979 --> 02:19:21.889 align:start position:0%
full expenses
foolishing

02:19:21.889 --> 02:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
foolishing
 
02:19:21.899 --> 02:19:22.730 align:start position:0%
foolishing
this

02:19:22.730 --> 02:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
annually yes
 
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's where since covid we've gotten
 
02:19:30.410 --> 02:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
several other funds to assist with that
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
we're about 10 million dollars
 
02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:19:36.650 --> 02:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
um is uh
 
02:19:39.650 --> 02:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
so 500 000 is State five hundred
 
02:19:44.089 --> 02:19:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm not sure I understand the
 
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
question representative was so was a
 
02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
million year total including the 500 000
 
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
a million five
 
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
did you ask that your total expenses
 
02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:10.969 --> 02:20:10.979 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry are you asking representative
 
02:20:15.010 --> 02:20:15.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm asking representative
 
02:20:18.290 --> 02:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
yes thank you all of the coalitions
 
02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
funding both federal and state and
 
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
private is
 
02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
um about 10 million but State funding is
 
02:20:30.050 --> 02:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
only uh approximately 2 million
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
and that's with covid

English for your testimony just a
 
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
curiosity question you know we've heard
 
02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that many marriages have
 
02:21:10.490 --> 02:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
been put on hold because of the virus
 
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
um how's this impacted the revenues uh
 
02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:18.530 --> 02:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
well representative I don't believe that
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
the Coalition is able to see the number
 
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
of marriage licenses that were granted
 
02:21:27.770 --> 02:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
over the last several years and I I
 
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
think that I would have to say I also
 
02:21:31.070 --> 02:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
know that anecdotally and I'm not aware
 
02:21:33.770 --> 02:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
of data I get to
 
02:21:36.530 --> 02:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
to substantiate that so I apologize for
 
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
not having the answer that's fine okay
 
02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:42.490 align:start position:0%

located

um Portsmouth
 
02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
Nashua Manchester Concord Laconia
 
02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
and Conway I might have gotten 13. Keen
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
did I when you provide us your other
 
02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
testimonies if you provide us that list
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
that would be great
 
02:22:42.170 --> 02:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
I certainly can we can provide you a map
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
that shows you a map of New Hampshire
 
02:22:46.250 --> 02:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
that shows you the catchment areas of
 
02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:47.700 align:start position:0%

02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much
 
02:22:57.050 --> 02:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.050 --> 02:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
I don't see any uh reps in the
 
02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:02.870 align:start position:0%
I don't see any uh reps in the
spillsburg

02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.410 --> 02:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um this English
 
02:23:10.610 --> 02:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh I did understand you to be defending
 
02:23:13.490 --> 02:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
the logic of uh drawing for marriage
 
02:23:13.500 --> 02:23:15.290 align:start position:0%
the logic of uh drawing for marriage
licenses

02:23:15.290 --> 02:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
but I think your emphasis was on the
 
02:23:21.170 --> 02:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
need for dedicated funds so my question
 
02:23:24.110 --> 02:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
is if we retained this
 
02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
and an amendment was brought forward
 
02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
that made a direct substitution
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
of a reliable source of dedicated funds
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.690 --> 02:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:40.130 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
representative

02:23:40.130 --> 02:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:23:42.530 --> 02:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we would only because
 
02:23:45.170 --> 02:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
as representative Tucker and I believe
 
02:23:45.180 --> 02:23:46.370 align:start position:0%
as representative Tucker and I believe
Almy

02:23:46.370 --> 02:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
Almy
 
02:23:49.250 --> 02:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned this has been a stable source
 
02:23:52.809 --> 02:23:52.819 align:start position:0%
of funding for almost 40 years
 
02:23:57.290 --> 02:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
and we would be concerned on a couple of
 
02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
levels that it could take away funding
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
from other very needed services in the
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire such as for instance
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
the opioid addiction that would come
 
02:24:08.690 --> 02:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
from the drug and alcohol fund and those
 
02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
types of um very important services so
 
02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
um we would be hesitant on that note and
 
02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
it is a small amount and is spread out
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
among 15 000 victims per year but it is
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
an amount that we can pretty much count
 
02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
on and I think that we would certainly
 
02:24:28.969 --> 02:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
look at whatever the committees or the
 
02:24:30.889 --> 02:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
legislature would offer
 
02:24:32.210 --> 02:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
but I don't think I could say
 
02:24:34.370 --> 02:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
definitively today representative that
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
we would not be in opposition of a
 
02:24:39.290 --> 02:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
change my goodness we've experienced a
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
lot of change over the last year haven't
 
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
we all
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm thank you I understand your
 
02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:45.050 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm thank you I understand your
concern

02:24:45.050 --> 02:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:24:49.610 --> 02:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
I have further questions from the
 
02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:53.690 align:start position:0%
I have further questions from the
committee

02:24:53.690 --> 02:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:59.570 --> 02:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.969 --> 02:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
I don't see any hands raised
 
02:25:06.530 --> 02:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:08.270 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:25:08.270 --> 02:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
18 signed up in support of the bill
 
02:25:16.969 --> 02:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
and 121 signed up in opposition to the

and 121 signed up in opposition to the
bill

02:25:19.690 --> 02:25:19.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:25.490 --> 02:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:28.429 --> 02:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments on how
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
to build 3 46.
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
if not then I'm going to close the
 
02:25:38.809 --> 02:25:38.819 align:start position:0%

02:26:11.330 --> 02:26:11.340 align:start position:0%

straightforward bill I think most
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
members are familiar with the Wayfair
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
decision that was made a few years ago
 
03:58:59.090 --> 03:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court it was a case
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
brought by the state of South Dakota
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
when all the way the Supreme Court it
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
was a 5-4 decision and basically they
 
03:59:08.689 --> 03:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
changed the idea of physical presence in
 
03:59:11.570 --> 03:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
order to collect uh sales tax so for
 
03:59:15.290 --> 03:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
example uh if some business in New
 
03:59:17.450 --> 03:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the past who had no
 
03:59:18.710 --> 03:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
physical presence let's say in
 
03:59:22.010 --> 03:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
California sold items to a resident of
 
03:59:24.410 --> 03:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
California over the Internet there was
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
no uh need to collect any sales tax uh
 
03:59:30.590 --> 03:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
by the company in New Hampshire and
 
03:59:32.689 --> 03:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
remit that to California
 
03:59:35.630 --> 03:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
this um Supreme Court decision the
 
03:59:37.370 --> 03:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
Wayfair decision changed that like I say
 
03:59:39.830 --> 03:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
in a 5-4 decision they came up with this
 
03:59:42.530 --> 03:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
virtual presence standard in which
 
03:59:44.990 --> 03:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
Justice Kennedy was the big purveyor of
 
03:59:46.849 --> 03:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
uh he he was the one who was really
 
03:59:49.250 --> 03:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
pushing this and basically what it comes
 
03:59:51.530 --> 03:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
down to now is that
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
if someone has a business in New
 
03:59:55.550 --> 03:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they sell that same
 
03:59:57.830 --> 03:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
product to somebody in California they
 
04:00:00.050 --> 04:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
have to collect the sales tax from the
 
04:00:02.570 --> 04:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
buyer and then remit that to the state
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
of California
 
04:00:05.689 --> 04:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
and for those who aren't familiar with
 
04:00:07.910 --> 04:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
it there it's a lot more complicated
 
04:00:10.010 --> 04:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
than that statement just sounds what I
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
just said because there's somewhere in
 
04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
the vicinity of 12 000 different sales
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
tax in United States uh different rates
 
04:00:21.650 --> 04:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
some places cities have them imposed on
 
04:00:24.170 --> 04:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
top of the state some products have them
 
04:00:26.510 --> 04:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh some other products that are very
 
04:00:28.370 --> 04:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
similar don't
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
um if you look at Massachusetts for
 
04:00:31.849 --> 04:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
example if you buy I think it's clothing
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
up to 200 is no tax but over 200 there
 
04:00:38.269 --> 04:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
is a tax uh certain things like
 
04:00:40.610 --> 04:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
charcoals considered a fuel so it's not
 
04:00:42.650 --> 04:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
taxed uh there's there's all these
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
varieties and it's almost impossible for
 
04:00:46.189 --> 04:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
anyone to keep up with it without I
 
04:00:48.050 --> 04:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
guess you'd have to hire some outside
 
04:00:50.510 --> 04:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
company whose expertise was doing that
 
04:00:53.689 --> 04:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
but my point is and the reason I put
 
04:00:56.330 --> 04:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
this forward was as most you aware a
 
04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago there was a lot of
 
04:01:00.170 --> 04:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
activity around this and it was meetings
 
04:01:02.090 --> 04:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
and so forth and but nothing really
 
04:01:04.490 --> 04:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
happened what has happened and since
 
04:01:06.290 --> 04:01:06.300 align:start position:0%
then is a lot of the states have
 
04:01:08.450 --> 04:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
followed the so-called South Dakota
 
04:01:10.969 --> 04:01:10.979 align:start position:0%
example which
 
04:01:12.290 --> 04:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
it could be a little bit off on the
 
04:01:14.450 --> 04:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
numbers here but I think they say if
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
this company in say New Hampshire if you
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
do get make less than 200 Sales to
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
individuals from South Dakota in a given
 
04:01:24.889 --> 04:01:24.899 align:start position:0%
year and the total value is less than
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
one hundred thousand dollars then you
 
04:01:28.610 --> 04:01:28.620 align:start position:0%
don't have to bother with the tax but
 
04:01:30.170 --> 04:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
nevertheless if you go over those
 
04:01:32.689 --> 04:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
amounts you do some states have followed
 
04:01:34.370 --> 04:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
that other states are still working on
 
04:01:37.790 --> 04:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
it but the reason I put this forward is
 
04:01:39.469 --> 04:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
because I mean the bill is pretty pretty
 
04:01:42.710 --> 04:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward it says nor the
 
04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
inhabitants of this state controllable
 
04:01:47.570 --> 04:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
by any other laws then those to which
 
04:01:49.250 --> 04:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
they or the representative body have
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
given consent therefore New Hampshire
 
04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
business no New Hampshire business
 
04:01:54.410 --> 04:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
retailer should be required to collect
 
04:01:56.750 --> 04:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
sales or use tax for a foreign
 
04:01:58.189 --> 04:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
government or provide any information
 
04:02:00.110 --> 04:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
the facilitation of collecting these tax
 
04:02:02.150 --> 04:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
and let's collection is mandated by the
 
04:02:03.769 --> 04:02:03.779 align:start position:0%
Congress of the United States in
 
04:02:04.969 --> 04:02:04.979 align:start position:0%
accordance with the Commerce Clause
 
04:02:07.729 --> 04:02:07.739 align:start position:0%
article one section A Clause 3 United
 
04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
States Constitution the Attorney General
 
04:02:11.330 --> 04:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire so defend
 
04:02:13.070 --> 04:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
this law in all jurisdictions where it's
 
04:02:15.849 --> 04:02:15.859 align:start position:0%
challenged and
 
04:02:18.110 --> 04:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
this puts forward the New Hampshire
 
04:02:21.170 --> 04:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I might also add that
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
like I said Kennedy Justice Kennedy was
 
04:02:25.550 --> 04:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
one of the pr he was the person pushing
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
this and he's gone obviously uh justice
 
04:02:31.550 --> 04:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
Ginsburg is gone so of the five justices
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
who voted in favor of it uh is only
 
04:02:37.250 --> 04:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
three left and I obviously don't know
 
04:02:39.229 --> 04:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
how the new justices would vote on it
 
04:02:41.929 --> 04:02:41.939 align:start position:0%
but I would think it would be difficult
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
if this was to get to the Supreme Court
 
04:02:46.370 --> 04:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
for the U.S Supreme Court to rule that
 
04:02:48.650 --> 04:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution was that
 
04:02:50.809 --> 04:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
was enacted prior to the Federal
 
04:02:53.929 --> 04:02:53.939 align:start position:0%
Constitution was unconstitutional
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
and I just don't see them doing that and
 
04:02:58.429 --> 04:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for putting in the uh
 
04:03:00.650 --> 04:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
shall defend the law because I don't
 
04:03:04.370 --> 04:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
want them going after individual
 
04:03:06.889 --> 04:03:06.899 align:start position:0%
companies and and try to take them I
 
04:03:08.090 --> 04:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
don't even know what court they take
 
04:03:10.130 --> 04:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
them to maybe federal court or state
 
04:03:12.170 --> 04:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
court in another state but the fact is
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
our constitution is very very clear on
 
04:03:17.210 --> 04:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
this and we never the people of New
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire never elected the Supreme
 
04:03:21.050 --> 04:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
Court nor did they elect the
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
representatives from South uh Dakota or
 
04:03:26.269 --> 04:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or California or any other
 
04:03:29.210 --> 04:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
state so our constitution says they will
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
not be required to follow those laws and
 
04:03:33.650 --> 04:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
the only case where it would come in is
 
04:03:35.330 --> 04:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
under the Federal Constitution which
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
clearly gives the power to regulate
 
04:03:39.410 --> 04:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
interstate trade under the Commerce
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
Clause to Congress of the United States
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
so I think this is what our constitution
 
04:03:47.809 --> 04:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
says it just simply codifies it I'll be
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions thank you
 
04:03:53.450 --> 04:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
for your testimony represent Harrington
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
um representative Bronte
 
04:03:58.130 --> 04:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington uh good seeing
 
04:04:01.610 --> 04:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
good hearing from you
 
04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
so you know we spent a lot of time on
 
04:04:06.349 --> 04:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
this on this issue over two sessions uh
 
04:04:07.969 --> 04:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
two two years worth
 
04:04:07.979 --> 04:04:08.689 align:start position:0%
two two years worth
um

04:04:08.689 --> 04:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
there was a joint committee with the
 
04:04:14.830 --> 04:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
Senate uh we had the governor's Council
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
involved in drafting language
 
04:04:20.450 --> 04:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
the goal of what we came out with which
 
04:04:21.889 --> 04:04:21.899 align:start position:0%
is in place now
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes the only way we can resolve this
 
04:04:29.210 --> 04:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
is going back to the Supreme Court
 
04:04:31.790 --> 04:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
but the trick is to be able to get the
 
04:04:34.130 --> 04:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to take the case
 
04:04:37.370 --> 04:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
and the council that we got was you got
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
to be careful about that you just can't
 
04:04:40.729 --> 04:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
say well we disagree with the Supreme
 
04:04:44.170 --> 04:04:44.180 align:start position:0%
Court and and and
 
04:04:46.750 --> 04:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
think they're going to take the case
 
04:04:50.570 --> 04:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
so uh yes this has never been ruled on
 
04:04:52.370 --> 04:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
under the Commerce Clause
 
04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh that's probably the Avenue eventually
 
04:04:58.189 --> 04:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
but it's our understanding that from um
 
04:05:01.130 --> 04:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
talking to dra just the other day uh for
 
04:05:01.140 --> 04:05:02.090 align:start position:0%
talking to dra just the other day uh for
everybody

04:05:02.090 --> 04:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
04:05:04.849 --> 04:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
there have not been that many
 
04:05:07.729 --> 04:05:07.739 align:start position:0%
inquiries the way our bill our current
 
04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
law works now is that
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
companies that are being reached uh out
 
04:05:14.750 --> 04:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
by from other states asking them to
 
04:05:18.290 --> 04:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
collect the the tax
 
04:05:20.269 --> 04:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
um we have not gotten many referrals
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
from other states or other companies
 
04:05:24.590 --> 04:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
about that
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
so uh I just want to make sure you you
 
04:05:29.689 --> 04:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
aware of that that it's it's been pretty
 
04:05:32.689 --> 04:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
calm since since our work of a couple of
 
04:05:34.849 --> 04:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
years ago uh are you aware of that yes
 
04:05:36.590 --> 04:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
yes I am aware of that I think probably
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of that has to do with the covid
 
04:05:40.130 --> 04:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
situation that that's everything else
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
has been put on the back burner so I'd
 
04:05:43.670 --> 04:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
kind of like to take advantage of that
 
04:05:46.130 --> 04:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
and I realized what was done there and
 
04:05:48.889 --> 04:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
that we haven't seen a big push but I
 
04:05:51.170 --> 04:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
think once things start to get back to
 
04:05:53.929 --> 04:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
normal some things won't and that's I
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
think this huge increase in the use of
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
the internet and these other states are
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
just going to look out there and just
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
say there's too many tax dollars we're
 
04:06:03.410 --> 04:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
losing and I think you'll see that uh
 
04:06:05.870 --> 04:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
that process accelerating as far as
 
04:06:08.510 --> 04:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
getting to the Supreme Court I agree uh
 
04:06:10.849 --> 04:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
it could be a long process but again I'm
 
04:06:13.250 --> 04:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
an engineer not a lawyer so this is my
 
04:06:15.229 --> 04:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
best thoughts and that's that by having
 
04:06:17.570 --> 04:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General defend it they
 
04:06:18.769 --> 04:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
could have the state of New Hampshire
 
04:06:20.809 --> 04:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
challenge you know if there was business
 
04:06:22.969 --> 04:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
a in New Hampshire being taken to court
 
04:06:24.769 --> 04:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
by the state of California
 
04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
then the state of New Hampshire could
 
04:06:29.330 --> 04:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
step in and challenge the state of
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
California which would then get primary
 
04:06:32.689 --> 04:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to the Supreme Court if
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's one state going after another state
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
that would be I guess the most uh
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
efficient way to get there if that can
 
04:06:41.689 --> 04:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
be done but I realized it's never easy
 
04:06:43.610 --> 04:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
going through the courts but I just
 
04:06:45.889 --> 04:06:45.899 align:start position:0%
think it gives a venue we have a
 
04:06:47.689 --> 04:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
constitution that's been there for you
 
04:06:50.210 --> 04:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
know over 200 years it's very very clear
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
what it says this is an ambiguous and I
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
think as representatives from the state
 
04:06:55.309 --> 04:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we ought to be
 
04:06:57.290 --> 04:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
defending that Constitution and saying
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
we will protect our companies uh under
 
04:07:02.030 --> 04:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
that under that provision of the
 
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution which says you can't do it
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
to them
 
04:07:06.769 --> 04:07:06.779 align:start position:0%
all right well I'll let this go for now
 
04:07:09.170 --> 04:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
but uh we may be hearing from the
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
attorney general who's in charge of this
 
04:07:11.040 --> 04:07:11.750 align:start position:0%
attorney general who's in charge of this
now

04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully and if we do have a hearing
 
04:07:16.490 --> 04:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'll make you aware of of that hearing
 
04:07:19.010 --> 04:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
or work session on this bill in which he
 
04:07:20.809 --> 04:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
would testify if he's not testifying
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
today yeah well thank you very much for
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate because if you know
 
04:07:26.030 --> 04:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
how to get in touch with someone at the
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office you must have
 
04:07:29.150 --> 04:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
much better connection than I do because
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
I've been trying for a while on this
 
04:07:33.769 --> 04:07:33.779 align:start position:0%
issue and other issues and I send emails
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
and get no response and if you call you
 
04:07:38.269 --> 04:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
simply get a tape saying
 
04:07:41.150 --> 04:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
um our mailboxes fill go away and
 
04:07:42.530 --> 04:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
there's no way to even leave a message
 
04:07:44.689 --> 04:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
so if you can get through to them let me
 
04:07:44.699 --> 04:07:45.469 align:start position:0%
so if you can get through to them let me
know

04:07:45.469 --> 04:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:07:48.410 --> 04:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
well our goal is to get an update as to
 
04:07:50.630 --> 04:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
where we're at okay but we we heard
 
04:07:54.410 --> 04:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
through the dra that uh
 
04:07:56.450 --> 04:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
that that the amount of activity is
 
04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
minimal uh what's going on in this so
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'll let that go uh thank you enough
 
04:08:05.450 --> 04:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Ames
 
04:08:07.130 --> 04:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:10.510 --> 04:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
um and picking up on representative
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
abrami's uh
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
points and background information
 
04:08:15.840 --> 04:08:17.330 align:start position:0%
points and background information
um

04:08:17.330 --> 04:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:21.290 --> 04:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
first we did enact substantial
 
04:08:23.450 --> 04:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
legislation after
 
04:08:26.210 --> 04:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
some hiccups along the road uh have
 
04:08:29.150 --> 04:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
involving a special session once during
 
04:08:31.309 --> 04:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
the summer and then we tried again and
 
04:08:33.950 --> 04:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
we got through it and uh reformed the
 
04:08:37.370 --> 04:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
bill and and put in place legislation to
 
04:08:40.370 --> 04:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
set the Attorney General sort of in a
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh position where
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
um that office would monitor what's
 
04:08:47.929 --> 04:08:47.939 align:start position:0%
going on and uh recommend actions or
 
04:08:50.210 --> 04:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
perhaps even take legal actions
 
04:08:53.689 --> 04:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
unilaterally for the state
 
04:08:56.290 --> 04:08:56.300 align:start position:0%
um and we set up a commission
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh to uh review what was going on the
 
04:09:02.330 --> 04:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
Attorney General was part of that the
 
04:09:05.090 --> 04:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's designee uh I was on
 
04:09:06.650 --> 04:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
it I don't know whether representative
 
04:09:09.110 --> 04:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
Romney was there I don't remember
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh and it was chaired by Senator
 
04:09:12.359 --> 04:09:13.610 align:start position:0%
um and uh and it was chaired by Senator
Morse

04:09:13.610 --> 04:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
Morse
 
04:09:15.769 --> 04:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
and covet got in the way
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
so uh it never it never reached the
 
04:09:21.650 --> 04:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
point of making the recommendations so
 
04:09:24.290 --> 04:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
far as I know uh that were called for by
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
the statute and now it's expired and it
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
would make I wonder uh representative
 
04:09:33.010 --> 04:09:33.020 align:start position:0%
Harrington if it might make more sense
 
04:09:37.450 --> 04:09:37.460 align:start position:0%
rather than just sort of go for
 
04:09:42.530 --> 04:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
the the bottom line as your bill does it
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
would make more sense to revive that
 
04:09:47.809 --> 04:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
commission I'm not recommending this I'm
 
04:09:49.070 --> 04:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
really asking
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
um so that the key actors the attorney
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
general who you've had a hard time
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
getting in touch with for example
 
04:09:59.570 --> 04:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
and uh Senate leaders and house leaders
 
04:10:00.860 --> 04:10:00.870 align:start position:0%
could uh
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:02.090 align:start position:0%
could uh
[Music]

04:10:02.090 --> 04:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:10:04.250 --> 04:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
hear the latest information what's going
 
04:10:07.130 --> 04:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
on Nationwide and in New Hampshire
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
and take considered action based on that
 
04:10:14.809 --> 04:10:14.819 align:start position:0%
and as you know I think uh well as you
 
04:10:16.010 --> 04:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
know the
 
04:10:16.020 --> 04:10:17.210 align:start position:0%
know the
uh

04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:20.030 --> 04:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
this kind of legal action is is costly
 
04:10:22.490 --> 04:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
and for a small state like New Hampshire
 
04:10:24.889 --> 04:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
to take the lead
 
04:10:29.570 --> 04:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
um uh is a step that has to be based on
 
04:10:32.809 --> 04:10:32.819 align:start position:0%
on something really sound
 
04:10:36.769 --> 04:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
um so my question is uh is about taking
 
04:10:39.410 --> 04:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
a different route than your bill
 
04:10:41.450 --> 04:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for your question I I would
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
suggest that we take multiple routes in
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
that I guess the best way to describe at
 
04:10:48.349 --> 04:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
least in my opinion what was done uh
 
04:10:50.150 --> 04:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
over that special session and so forth
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
is we put hurdles up that made it more
 
04:10:56.450 --> 04:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
difficult for a another state to force
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
someone to collect sales tax business in
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we didn't prevent it we
 
04:11:01.189 --> 04:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
just made it more difficult they hit a
 
04:11:03.050 --> 04:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
jump through a few Hoops here and file
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
things here and do this but my proposal
 
04:11:08.990 --> 04:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
is not a hurdle it's a roadblock it
 
04:11:12.170 --> 04:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
would stop them say you can't do it and
 
04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
I'll still come back always to the oath
 
04:11:16.849 --> 04:11:16.859 align:start position:0%
that we all took which says we're
 
04:11:18.110 --> 04:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to defend and uphold the
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
Constitution this is what the
 
04:11:21.769 --> 04:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
Constitution says and we should be
 
04:11:23.809 --> 04:11:23.819 align:start position:0%
defending and upholding it that doesn't
 
04:11:25.490 --> 04:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
mean we can't take alternate approaches
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
as well I mean we hit him with
 
04:11:27.950 --> 04:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
everything we got as far as I'm
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
concerned if there's other ways to to
 
04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult for doing it
 
04:11:33.290 --> 04:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
let's go for it but I think we have that
 
04:11:35.210 --> 04:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
obligation to uphold the rights of the
 
04:11:37.370 --> 04:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire
 
04:11:39.050 --> 04:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
okay I'll leave it there thank you
 
04:11:42.830 --> 04:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
you're welcome represent Harrington uh
 
04:11:46.189 --> 04:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
representative Ames idea of
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
of the commission would you be against
 
04:11:48.720 --> 04:11:52.729 align:start position:0%
of the commission would you be against
that

04:11:52.729 --> 04:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:52.739 --> 04:11:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
nope

04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
nope
 
04:11:55.729 --> 04:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:11:57.710 --> 04:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
I lost I don't know if anyone can hear
 
04:12:01.010 --> 04:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
me but I can't hear you okay all right
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
again uh let me make sure my heart goes
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
on now I can hear you now I can hear you
 
04:12:05.880 --> 04:12:07.269 align:start position:0%
on now I can hear you now I can hear you
okay

04:12:07.269 --> 04:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative Ames suggestion of having
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
a commission reenacted would you object
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
to um having this changed into a
 
04:12:18.479 --> 04:12:20.030 align:start position:0%
to um having this changed into a
commission

04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
well I mean if it would be a question of
 
04:12:24.830 --> 04:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
and we have to be realistic about things
 
04:12:26.570 --> 04:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
obviously if it's if it's a question of
 
04:12:29.210 --> 04:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
not getting this passed or changing it
 
04:12:30.530 --> 04:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
to a commission I would certainly
 
04:12:32.929 --> 04:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
consider that as a as a way to go down
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
that road I think we need to be doing we
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
need to be doing something and if we
 
04:12:38.990 --> 04:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
have a commission that would be
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
certainly better than having just have
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill killed so I mean I'm going to
 
04:12:43.969 --> 04:12:43.979 align:start position:0%
be a realist I've been around long
 
04:12:45.889 --> 04:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
enough Norm you know that you gotta if
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
there's no sense in just going in with
 
04:12:50.090 --> 04:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
dreams because that gets you nowhere
 
04:12:53.570 --> 04:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Elliott uh yes
 
04:12:56.990 --> 04:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh my thought
 
04:13:00.050 --> 04:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
is that uh there is no need for this
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
bill uh that that I'm aware of and
 
04:13:05.210 --> 04:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
there's no motion uh from representative
 
04:13:08.570 --> 04:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
Harrington uh is it your intention that
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
we ought to practice today or uh
 
04:13:16.370 --> 04:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it'll pass uh I'm
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought this was just a public
 
04:13:19.790 --> 04:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
hearing and not the executives first
 
04:13:22.130 --> 04:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
questions representative Elliott
 
04:13:26.410 --> 04:13:26.420 align:start position:0%
say that again if you have a question
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes what is what is representative
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
Harrington emotion I know it's a public
 
04:13:34.250 --> 04:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
hearing but what's what's going to be
 
04:13:36.170 --> 04:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
his motion to pass this
 
04:13:38.689 --> 04:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
well I would it doesn't make that motion
 
04:13:42.410 --> 04:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
I'm just here as the bill sponsor I
 
04:13:46.250 --> 04:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
don't have the authority to make a
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
motion one way or the other in ways and
 
04:13:51.290 --> 04:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
means oh okay I get it okay
 
04:13:56.689 --> 04:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.750 --> 04:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:14:01.370 --> 04:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington we went
 
04:14:05.269 --> 04:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
through in a awful lot of testimony and
 
04:14:07.370 --> 04:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
we worked very closely with Governor
 
04:14:10.370 --> 04:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
sanu's legal counsel who is an extremely
 
04:14:12.170 --> 04:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
capable individual
 
04:14:14.750 --> 04:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
and with the Attorney General's office
 
04:14:18.830 --> 04:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
they all assured us that we were not
 
04:14:21.410 --> 04:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get
 
04:14:26.450 --> 04:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
something like this in without being
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
sued and losing in federal court unless
 
04:14:33.950 --> 04:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
we want to secede from the United States
 
04:14:33.960 --> 04:14:35.929 align:start position:0%
we want to secede from the United States
uh

04:14:35.929 --> 04:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:38.630 --> 04:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
I realize you think that maybe scotus
 
04:14:41.689 --> 04:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
would change their minds but on
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the commission was not working when
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
it died because on the person in charge
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
of it was from the Senate was the
 
04:14:56.809 --> 04:14:56.819 align:start position:0%
original author of the bill and
 
04:14:56.819 --> 04:14:57.769 align:start position:0%
original author of the bill and
um

04:14:57.769 --> 04:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
didn't could not get people to show up
 
04:15:03.170 --> 04:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
from the attorney the attorney general's
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
office frequently had problems with
 
04:15:07.250 --> 04:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
showing up because the time that was
 
04:15:08.929 --> 04:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
picked was sometime when they were in
 
04:15:13.610 --> 04:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
Trials on and on
 
04:15:15.950 --> 04:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
we were not getting frequent
 
04:15:19.729 --> 04:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
participation from uh the dra did come
 
04:15:24.050 --> 04:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
the business and economic Affairs did
 
04:15:27.290 --> 04:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
not quite frequently on
 
04:15:30.349 --> 04:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
but we did get information as you said
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
that nobody uh very very few if any
 
04:15:38.689 --> 04:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
you I believe it was if any people had
 
04:15:40.849 --> 04:15:40.859 align:start position:0%
actually complained that they had been
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
taxed by this we did know that places
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
are already paying and have been paying
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
before this all blew up
 
04:15:49.319 --> 04:15:50.090 align:start position:0%
before this all blew up
um

04:15:50.090 --> 04:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:52.729 --> 04:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
to avoid having to do lawsuits with
 
04:15:54.110 --> 04:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
other states
 
04:15:57.229 --> 04:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
so would you
 
04:15:59.389 --> 04:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
um a commission that started from the
 
04:16:01.790 --> 04:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
house probably could get further with
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
this if and my so my question is
 
04:16:07.729 --> 04:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
would you mind us turning it into a
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
commission again
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question and let
 
04:16:14.689 --> 04:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
me just let me answer it in two parts I
 
04:16:17.330 --> 04:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
still think you know you said that uh
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be upheld in court but I
 
04:16:20.689 --> 04:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
think we still have an obligation
 
04:16:22.490 --> 04:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
because it's a right to find in our
 
04:16:23.809 --> 04:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
Constitution and we ought to be
 
04:16:25.849 --> 04:16:25.859 align:start position:0%
defending that that's that's one of the
 
04:16:28.790 --> 04:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
jobs that we have uh is to uphold the
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
rights that are defined in the New
 
04:16:32.090 --> 04:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state constitution and this is
 
04:16:35.150 --> 04:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
clearly defined in there and this uh the
 
04:16:36.889 --> 04:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court really is a violation of
 
04:16:39.170 --> 04:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
that so I think we have an obligation to
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
do that but having said that as I said
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
to the chairman one has to be realistic
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
too and to have this uh you know get
 
04:16:50.750 --> 04:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
voted down 15 to 5 or whatever uh and go
 
04:16:53.450 --> 04:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
nowhere is not accomplishing anything so
 
04:16:55.370 --> 04:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
if it's in the wisdom of the committee
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
they think in order for this to move
 
04:16:59.150 --> 04:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
forward we can re-establish that
 
04:17:01.010 --> 04:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
commission I could I could live with
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
that it's not my first preference but
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's certainly better than having this
 
04:17:05.150 --> 04:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
the bill just to feed it and go away
 
04:17:08.030 --> 04:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
because I do realize it's been hasn't
 
04:17:09.530 --> 04:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
been happening that much but I think
 
04:17:12.110 --> 04:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
come this summer next fall things get
 
04:17:15.889 --> 04:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
back to normal and the the uh Amazon
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
trucks are still rolling all all over
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
the world like they are now there's
 
04:17:21.889 --> 04:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
going to be much more push on these
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
other states to start collecting that
 
04:17:28.030 --> 04:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:17:32.399 --> 04:17:40.809 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
foreign

04:17:40.809 --> 04:17:40.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.870 --> 04:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
Harrington oh thank you Mr chairman we
 
04:17:48.170 --> 04:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
have I have only one person that signed
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
up that's a Glenn bracket
 
04:17:54.170 --> 04:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
who represent a lobbyists in the
 
04:17:58.030 --> 04:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
working people the New Hampshire ASL CIO
 
04:18:01.070 --> 04:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
their opposition
 
04:18:08.689 --> 04:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
once again anybody else wish to testify
 
04:18:15.410 --> 04:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
for or against House Bill 400
 
04:18:15.420 --> 04:18:17.809 align:start position:0%
for or against House Bill 400
attendees

04:18:17.809 --> 04:18:17.819 align:start position:0%
attendees
 
04:18:21.710 --> 04:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:25.250 --> 04:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:28.849 --> 04:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say something
 
04:18:31.610 --> 04:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
I just said no representative major no
 
04:18:34.010 --> 04:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
attendees have their hands raised all
 
04:18:35.750 --> 04:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
right then I'm going to close the public
 
04:18:44.809 --> 04:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:48.590 --> 04:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
the next bill is scheduled for 1 30. it
 
04:18:50.450 --> 04:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
is 1 21
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh could we be out of water if we
 
04:18:56.090 --> 04:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
discussed the cost of 400 now
 
04:18:59.689 --> 04:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:03.889 --> 04:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:08.689 --> 04:19:08.699 align:start position:0%
putting a calendar as a recession
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
although my my opinion is that uh this
 
04:19:14.570 --> 04:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
just brought up Wayfarer again
 
04:19:17.090 --> 04:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh and that you know maybe we should
 
04:19:19.130 --> 04:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
here hopefully before we we vote on this
 
04:19:19.140 --> 04:19:20.090 align:start position:0%
here hopefully before we we vote on this
bill

04:19:20.090 --> 04:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:19:22.849 --> 04:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
that we can get the AG I know we have
 
04:19:24.650 --> 04:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
the name of the specific person that we
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
have to contact
 
04:19:28.610 --> 04:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
to come and explain exactly where we are
 
04:19:31.490 --> 04:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
right now just as an update to us okay
 
04:19:33.650 --> 04:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the bill in a way but
 
04:19:35.809 --> 04:19:35.819 align:start position:0%
indirectly yes with the bill yeah well
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense to me that's a
 
04:19:39.889 --> 04:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
good suggestion yeah I'll get a hold of
 
04:19:39.899 --> 04:19:40.910 align:start position:0%
good suggestion yeah I'll get a hold of
it

04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:19:44.269 --> 04:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
I think you'd have to be sure to to get
 
04:19:46.010 --> 04:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
him during a time he was available
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
that's been one of the big problems they
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
go off to court all the time
 
04:19:54.650 --> 04:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
I'll get for my for my former call and
 
04:19:59.809 --> 04:19:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:01.849 --> 04:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
because he's the one who really want to
 
04:20:04.150 --> 04:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
04:20:07.429 --> 04:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
the governor's Council
 
04:20:10.990 --> 04:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
no no no he's the attorney that oh okay
 
04:20:14.330 --> 04:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
no I think I think uh to clarify John
 
04:20:17.090 --> 04:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
farmalla uh at that time and I think
 
04:20:18.889 --> 04:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
think still although I don't know for
 
04:20:21.410 --> 04:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
sure was the governor's legal counsel
 
04:20:25.130 --> 04:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
right and and he was uh and from the
 
04:20:26.750 --> 04:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general's side there were
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
various people that came to talk with us
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
at one point bill hardinger was there
 
04:20:35.330 --> 04:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
wearing uh some kind of consultant hat
 
04:20:38.330 --> 04:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
to it to the attorney general and uh
 
04:20:41.150 --> 04:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
very much involved in the redrafting of
 
04:20:44.570 --> 04:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
the bill so I think uh farnella yes but
 
04:20:46.969 --> 04:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
he's probably not engaged right now on
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
this issue and there is uh probably an
 
04:20:51.650 --> 04:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General who has the
 
04:20:54.170 --> 04:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
assignment I'm sure he has the right
 
04:20:54.180 --> 04:20:55.210 align:start position:0%
assignment I'm sure he has the right
person

04:20:55.210 --> 04:20:55.220 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
I think Carolyn Lear sent us a note
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
um uh on a name she sent us a name of
 
04:21:04.010 --> 04:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
somebody from that she deals with all
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
the time uh from the AJ's office that
 
04:21:09.889 --> 04:21:09.899 align:start position:0%
she thinks is the right person so I I
 
04:21:11.870 --> 04:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
printed that email out but I'll I'll
 
04:21:15.610 --> 04:21:15.620 align:start position:0%
talk to you offline uh about it okay
 
04:21:18.769 --> 04:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
so I just like to point out that one of
 
04:21:21.050 --> 04:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
the things that was in what we passed
 
04:21:24.530 --> 04:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
was that the dra and the AGS office
 
04:21:27.889 --> 04:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
would be cooperating on finding people
 
04:21:32.210 --> 04:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
who were upset at being being taxed in
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
this way and certainly when they're
 
04:21:36.650 --> 04:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
being taxed retroactively it's very
 
04:21:36.660 --> 04:21:39.189 align:start position:0%
being taxed retroactively it's very
difficult

04:21:39.189 --> 04:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:43.490 --> 04:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
we can review that work session on the
 
04:21:46.130 --> 04:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
second and see where we want to proceed
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
based upon their important
 
04:21:50.990 --> 04:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
Norman's patigan
 
04:21:52.729 --> 04:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
um yeah I found an email
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
um the name of the attorney Samuel
 
04:21:56.510 --> 04:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
Garland she said yes that we speak
 
04:21:58.610 --> 04:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
that's the same one as last time okay
 
04:21:58.620 --> 04:22:00.590 align:start position:0%
that's the same one as last time okay
yes

04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:22:02.210 --> 04:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
all right she's been talking to him
 
04:22:04.429 --> 04:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
about this and other things on and off
 
04:22:04.439 --> 04:22:08.570 align:start position:0%
about this and other things on and off
so

04:22:08.570 --> 04:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out that there has
 
04:22:15.650 --> 04:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
been on all of the states that have
 
04:22:17.809 --> 04:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
started collecting this and most of them
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
have have experienced large increases in
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
their sales tax revenues
 
04:22:23.840 --> 04:22:25.450 align:start position:0%
their sales tax revenues
and

04:22:25.450 --> 04:22:25.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:28.250 --> 04:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
there is no way they're going to give
 
04:22:31.250 --> 04:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
that up without a fight
 
04:22:35.330 --> 04:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
we have six more minutes
 
04:22:40.550 --> 04:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
you have a hand up
 
04:22:44.570 --> 04:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh that's in hack and Phillips yes
 
04:22:46.849 --> 04:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
Master chair I just wanted to bring up
 
04:22:49.130 --> 04:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
um a side comment about this given the
 
04:22:50.809 --> 04:22:50.819 align:start position:0%
fact that the work session is scheduled
 
04:22:53.450 --> 04:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
for the 2nd of March I
 
04:22:55.250 --> 04:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
probably have a professional conflict
 
04:22:57.170 --> 04:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
that day where all I too will be in
 
04:22:59.570 --> 04:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
court and I just wanted to weigh in with
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit of my concern that uh you
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
know the cost of litigation at the
 
04:23:07.729 --> 04:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court level is exorbitant and
 
04:23:09.670 --> 04:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that is a prudent
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal determination to make in such a
 
04:23:14.269 --> 04:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
year where we're already worried about a
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
health care crisis as well as you know
 
04:23:20.090 --> 04:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
budget revenues and I just I'm not sure
 
04:23:22.610 --> 04:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
that that is a prudent
 
04:23:24.530 --> 04:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
um cause of action for the state to be
 
04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your input
 
04:23:34.670 --> 04:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh anybody else may I just follow up by
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
saying beyond the fiscal concerns I am
 
04:23:39.410 --> 04:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
deeply concerned about the
 
04:23:41.330 --> 04:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
constitutionality and bringing this case
 
04:23:41.340 --> 04:23:42.229 align:start position:0%
constitutionality and bringing this case
though

04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
though
 
04:23:44.030 --> 04:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
um on its merits alone I also have
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
concerns but I think from a budgetary
 
04:23:46.319 --> 04:23:47.929 align:start position:0%
concerns but I think from a budgetary
perspective

04:23:47.929 --> 04:23:47.939 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:23:50.469 --> 04:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to weigh in both there
 
04:23:54.889 --> 04:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
you won't be available in a second
 
04:24:01.250 --> 04:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:03.410 --> 04:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
 
04:24:05.229 --> 04:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
you should hear
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
what the attorney has to say
 
04:24:12.530 --> 04:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:15.410 --> 04:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is an important issue for the state
 
04:24:17.760 --> 04:24:19.969 align:start position:0%
this is an important issue for the state
so

04:24:19.969 --> 04:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:21.950 --> 04:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
we've been fighting this tour
 
04:24:25.130 --> 04:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:27.889 --> 04:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
ten representative major has been
 
04:24:32.450 --> 04:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
fighting it I think for about 18 years
 
04:24:38.929 --> 04:24:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:42.290 --> 04:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
I I knew all the
 
04:24:44.269 --> 04:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
people involved but some of them are
 
04:24:48.550 --> 04:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.530 --> 04:24:52.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.540 --> 04:24:53.889 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:24:53.889 --> 04:24:53.899 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:24:55.849 --> 04:24:55.859 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:24:58.370 --> 04:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
you have to realize there's only five
 
04:25:00.530 --> 04:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
states that aren't that doesn't have a
 
04:25:02.450 --> 04:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:09.769 --> 04:25:09.779 align:start position:0%
as far as going to Congress to get
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
legislation to help us out that isn't
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
well the biggest majority we have is two
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
senators I mean who could have 10
 
04:25:22.849 --> 04:25:22.859 align:start position:0%
Senators out of 90.
 
04:25:24.670 --> 04:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
but in the house
 
04:25:27.650 --> 04:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
out of 535 members
 
04:25:31.490 --> 04:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
we may have a dozen
 
04:25:31.500 --> 04:25:33.470 align:start position:0%
we may have a dozen
when

04:25:33.470 --> 04:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:25:33.480 --> 04:25:35.570 align:start position:0%
when
[Music]

04:25:35.570 --> 04:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
is to somehow get it through the course
 
04:25:42.889 --> 04:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
and three of those states have allowed
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
their big cities to collect sales taxes
 
04:25:45.359 --> 04:25:48.349 align:start position:0%
their big cities to collect sales taxes
yes

04:25:48.349 --> 04:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:50.689 --> 04:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
so we're unique because we're the only
 
04:25:53.570 --> 04:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
state without a broad-based tax income
 
04:25:56.689 --> 04:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:00.530 --> 04:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
anyway it is oops not quite yet ready I
 
04:26:02.929 --> 04:26:02.939 align:start position:0%
got one more another hand up now okay
 
04:26:07.490 --> 04:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
Pat not me uh John uh John yeah oh yeah
 
04:26:11.090 --> 04:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry about that John no no problem
 
04:26:13.630 --> 04:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess first a question I mean if is
 
04:26:16.429 --> 04:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
what I'm understanding from the Lost
 
04:26:18.290 --> 04:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
side of this are people saying that if
 
04:26:20.929 --> 04:26:20.939 align:start position:0%
we pass this it'll automatically trigger
 
04:26:23.389 --> 04:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
The Challenge and wind up in the Supreme
 
04:26:23.399 --> 04:26:25.910 align:start position:0%
The Challenge and wind up in the Supreme
Court

04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:28.189 --> 04:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
and notice that's a question for a
 
04:26:30.170 --> 04:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
lawyer in the group I mean is that what
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
people are saying that if we pass this
 
04:26:32.570 --> 04:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
we're automatically going to be
 
04:26:34.189 --> 04:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
challenged and it's going to go to
 
04:26:36.649 --> 04:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
04:26:38.450 --> 04:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
how about
 
04:26:40.130 --> 04:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
names or
 
04:26:42.229 --> 04:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
hey you're asking whether Mr
 
04:26:42.239 --> 04:26:43.670 align:start position:0%
hey you're asking whether Mr
Harrington's

04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington's
 
04:26:43.680 --> 04:26:45.590 align:start position:0%
Harrington's
suggestion

04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
04:26:48.349 --> 04:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
would end us up in the Supreme Court
 
04:26:50.510 --> 04:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
well yeah so let me first weigh in and
 
04:26:52.490 --> 04:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
then maybe dick you can weigh in I know
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
you're real close to this as well yeah
 
04:26:55.790 --> 04:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it would certainly it would
 
04:26:57.649 --> 04:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
certainly trigger something by the other
 
04:27:01.130 --> 04:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
states against us and it is going to be
 
04:27:03.170 --> 04:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
uh but that's not the way we wanted it
 
04:27:05.450 --> 04:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
to happen we wanted to pick our battle
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
if there was ever to be a battle in a
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
situation where we actually had a chance
 
04:27:10.389 --> 04:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
of winning
 
04:27:14.689 --> 04:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
and doing it this way it wasn't it was a
 
04:27:16.610 --> 04:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
lot of conversation around this
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
and that our approach we felt that the
 
04:27:21.229 --> 04:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
approach that's in place right now is
 
04:27:23.090 --> 04:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
the approach
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
um we fend it off it seems okay maybe
 
04:27:27.530 --> 04:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
it's because of the virus I don't know
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
so far we've fended off these states uh
 
04:27:32.630 --> 04:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not banging their
 
04:27:35.450 --> 04:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
doors down but I think I think we got to
 
04:27:37.729 --> 04:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
do this in a more like we did we came up
 
04:27:39.290 --> 04:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
with a very systematic way of
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
approaching this we've got the question
 
04:27:45.530 --> 04:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
the question was if we pass this will we
 
04:27:48.410 --> 04:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
end up with a supreme court no I I guess
 
04:27:52.849 --> 04:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
my response would be that uh
 
04:27:57.530 --> 04:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
one never knows um this would be um
 
04:27:59.689 --> 04:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
you know on his face
 
04:28:03.769 --> 04:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
a rejection of federal Authority that
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't stand anyway a
 
04:28:06.479 --> 04:28:07.790 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't stand anyway a
challenge

04:28:07.790 --> 04:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
04:28:10.610 --> 04:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
could well be would likely be successful
 
04:28:13.189 --> 04:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
I would say but the fact that it's on
 
04:28:15.170 --> 04:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
the St our statute books just sitting
 
04:28:17.809 --> 04:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
there it doesn't necessarily mean that
 
04:28:20.570 --> 04:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
it will lead to litigation
 
04:28:23.389 --> 04:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
um but if there was a company that
 
04:28:24.889 --> 04:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
refused to pay
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
the uh tax of California say or whatever
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh like Wayfair did
 
04:28:36.170 --> 04:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
um then you've got a case you've got uh
 
04:28:40.370 --> 04:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
harm you've got the uh a real case or
 
04:28:42.349 --> 04:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
controversy is it's
 
04:28:47.110 --> 04:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
put in the law that provides a basis for
 
04:28:49.610 --> 04:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
legal action and review
 
04:28:52.610 --> 04:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
so I I I would doubt that just having it
 
04:28:55.969 --> 04:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
on our books would uh by itself
 
04:28:57.830 --> 04:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
lead to something
 
04:28:59.689 --> 04:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
so it almost sounds like there's no way
 
04:29:02.030 --> 04:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire to
 
04:29:04.490 --> 04:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
protect our businesses from this I mean
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
even if we said we'll fight for any
 
04:29:09.170 --> 04:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
businesses get sued
 
04:29:10.969 --> 04:29:10.979 align:start position:0%
um we're still going to end up in at the
 
04:29:13.610 --> 04:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court potentially and lose
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
I mean we might win I I shouldn't have
 
04:29:18.170 --> 04:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
said it categorically who knows you know
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
as someone pointed out as a different
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court than it was I think
 
04:29:23.149 --> 04:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington pointed that
 
04:29:25.610 --> 04:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
out it's different different memberships
 
04:29:28.490 --> 04:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
so you never know uh and you never know
 
04:29:31.250 --> 04:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
whether justices will rethink the
 
04:29:34.550 --> 04:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
situation the Constitutional law is a
 
04:29:35.570 --> 04:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
moving Target
 
04:29:39.410 --> 04:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
we might have enough when based on the
 
04:29:44.809 --> 04:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:46.729 --> 04:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
to all the Supreme Court did was it it
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
sent it sent it back down to the South
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
Carolina at South Carolina South Dakota
 
04:29:52.490 --> 04:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
courts to deal with again
 
04:29:54.110 --> 04:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
I think if I remember correctly
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative Ames I think that's what
 
04:29:58.670 --> 04:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
happened that is what happened and then
 
04:30:01.370 --> 04:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
the South Dakota courts vacated the case
 
04:30:03.229 --> 04:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
right they said there's nothing more to
 
04:30:05.570 --> 04:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
argue about yeah so that was that was
 
04:30:07.130 --> 04:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
the end of that
 
04:30:11.809 --> 04:30:11.819 align:start position:0%
could I just quickly add in on we
 
04:30:15.410 --> 04:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
of what we were going after was the
 
04:30:19.250 --> 04:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court set up a number of things
 
04:30:22.010 --> 04:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
as recommendations essentially in their
 
04:30:24.110 --> 04:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
decision both the people who voted
 
04:30:25.809 --> 04:30:25.819 align:start position:0%
against and the people who voted for
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
said said if you're going to do this you
 
04:30:34.610 --> 04:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
have to to put in a reasonable floor for
 
04:30:39.590 --> 04:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
how much sales tax is being uh
 
04:30:42.849 --> 04:30:42.859 align:start position:0%
being requested from one
 
04:30:48.170 --> 04:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
state on that is you cannot go after a
 
04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
state for under a thousand hundred
 
04:30:54.110 --> 04:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars worth of sales that you
 
04:30:55.849 --> 04:30:55.859 align:start position:0%
were taxing
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
on and they had a number of other
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
conditions like that in there that meant
 
04:31:04.849 --> 04:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
that a small business
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
which has more trouble on dealing with
 
04:31:11.630 --> 04:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
ten thousand jurisdictions of sales tax
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
places on was going to be protected
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
against being told that they have to to
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to to find out what
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
Oakland California resident who is
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
buying their pot
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
is is going to have to pay in sales tax
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
and figure out how to send it to Oakland
 
04:31:34.680 --> 04:31:36.070 align:start position:0%
and figure out how to send it to Oakland
California

04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
California
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to have to stop this yeah
 
04:31:43.130 --> 04:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you and open the public hearing on
 
04:31:46.250 --> 04:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 504
 
04:31:49.610 --> 04:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 504 is an act relative to
 
04:31:52.490 --> 04:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
the State education property tax and the
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income homeowners
 
04:31:57.530 --> 04:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program
 
04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors Richard Ames and
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
represented Ames
 
04:32:05.090 --> 04:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:05.100 --> 04:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:09.410 --> 04:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
and uh I am here to
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill 504 uh and it's
 
04:32:18.889 --> 04:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
I feel privileged to be able to do so I
 
04:32:20.689 --> 04:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
I want to note at the outset that I have
 
04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
I think coming up to speak behind me uh
 
04:32:27.050 --> 04:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
04:32:29.530 --> 04:32:29.540 align:start position:0%
uh who chair at the school funding
 
04:32:33.950 --> 04:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
commission and uh William Arden who was
 
04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
also a member of that commission and uh
 
04:32:39.649 --> 04:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
Marjorie representative Porter
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and Jeff Mick Lynch of the school
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
funding commission so I'm going to try
 
04:32:47.250 --> 04:32:47.260 align:start position:0%
to be quick although this is
 
04:32:47.260 --> 04:32:49.010 align:start position:0%
to be quick although this is
[Music]

04:32:49.010 --> 04:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and then allow time for these others
 
04:32:55.250 --> 04:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
and there are others as well who I I
 
04:32:57.889 --> 04:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
think want to speak I'm sure some will
 
04:33:00.889 --> 04:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
be speaking in opposition so here we go
 
04:33:05.929 --> 04:33:05.939 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is uh it really has has two
 
04:33:08.449 --> 04:33:08.459 align:start position:0%
pieces to it that go together that
 
04:33:11.090 --> 04:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
interrelate with one another one is a
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
reform of the Statewide education
 
04:33:14.750 --> 04:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
04:33:18.890 --> 04:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
and the other is a a reform of the
 
04:33:21.650 --> 04:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
existing low to moderate income
 
04:33:24.890 --> 04:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
homeowners property tax relief program
 
04:33:27.289 --> 04:33:27.299 align:start position:0%
the two come together and I'll try to
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
explain how and there's a third feature
 
04:33:31.189 --> 04:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
of it which calls for a study of certain
 
04:33:34.250 --> 04:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
issues that aren't addressed immediately
 
04:33:38.209 --> 04:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
by these two other reforms looking at
 
04:33:40.849 --> 04:33:40.859 align:start position:0%
the bill if you looked at it but maybe I
 
04:33:42.529 --> 04:33:42.539 align:start position:0%
should back up I sent I sent to all
 
04:33:44.709 --> 04:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
members of ways and means
 
04:33:47.810 --> 04:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
some documents I'm working off of those
 
04:33:51.529 --> 04:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
documents here one was a three-page
 
04:33:51.539 --> 04:33:53.330 align:start position:0%
documents here one was a three-page
documents

04:33:53.330 --> 04:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
documents
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
um the first page the three and a half
 
04:33:58.189 --> 04:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
page document I think the first page is
 
04:34:02.090 --> 04:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
key elements of House Bill 504
 
04:34:04.490 --> 04:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
um the second page is a chart that shows
 
04:34:04.500 --> 04:34:05.590 align:start position:0%
um the second page is a chart that shows
certain

04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
certain
 
04:34:10.250 --> 04:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
impacts changes that result from it it
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
would result if this bill work to be
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
enacted and the last uh the page three
 
04:34:17.689 --> 04:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
to four to the brief history of the
 
04:34:19.369 --> 04:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax which
 
04:34:24.289 --> 04:34:24.299 align:start position:0%
we colloquially refer to as swept
 
04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and then I also sent to you a couple
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
of spreadsheets to try to illustrate the
 
04:34:34.689 --> 04:34:34.699 align:start position:0%
impacts of these changes both the
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
property tax relief he's on the other uh
 
04:34:42.010 --> 04:34:42.020 align:start position:0%
pace which is reform of swept
 
04:34:46.250 --> 04:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
using both the towns that produce
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
so-called excess swept and I'll get to
 
04:34:52.250 --> 04:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
that and another set of towns that I I
 
04:34:54.609 --> 04:34:54.619 align:start position:0%
call it comparatory towns
 
04:34:56.570 --> 04:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
uh will be impacted by these reforms in
 
04:35:02.449 --> 04:35:02.459 align:start position:0%
different ways so you've got all those
 
04:35:03.949 --> 04:35:03.959 align:start position:0%
materials I hope you got a chance to
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
look at them I'm not going to go through
 
04:35:07.010 --> 04:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
them in detail right now obviously
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
because time doesn't permit it
 
04:35:13.609 --> 04:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
um so two components to this bill swept
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
reform and property tax relief
 
04:35:20.810 --> 04:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
pages one and two of the bill through to
 
04:35:24.730 --> 04:35:24.740 align:start position:0%
line 27 on page two are the swept reform
 
04:35:28.189 --> 04:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
changes Pages uh
 
04:35:28.199 --> 04:35:30.830 align:start position:0%
changes Pages uh
to

04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:35:32.990 --> 04:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
to four
 
04:35:34.689 --> 04:35:34.699 align:start position:0%
are The
 
04:35:37.310 --> 04:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
Architects relief program reform changes
 
04:35:39.650 --> 04:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
on the uh at the end of the bill is the
 
04:35:40.849 --> 04:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:35:43.369 --> 04:35:43.379 align:start position:0%
on the swept reform
 
04:35:45.529 --> 04:35:45.539 align:start position:0%
first thing to say is there's no change
 
04:35:49.490 --> 04:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
in this bill in the swept rate and the
 
04:35:51.470 --> 04:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax rate
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
that's figured under current law as the
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
rate that will raise 360 million dollars
 
04:36:01.330 --> 04:36:01.340 align:start position:0%
when applied against the taxable
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax base which
 
04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
excludes utilities and railroads
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
and it excludes those as we discussed I
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
think yesterday because those are taxed
 
04:36:20.689 --> 04:36:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
so no change in the rate whatsoever the
 
04:36:25.310 --> 04:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
rate floats
 
04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and uh it's going down because it
 
04:36:30.590 --> 04:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
takes less money less a lower rate
 
04:36:33.849 --> 04:36:33.859 align:start position:0%
nowadays to raise 360 million dollars
 
04:36:36.529 --> 04:36:36.539 align:start position:0%
than it used to take because property
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
values are going up
 
04:36:41.689 --> 04:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
um so that's the rate
 
04:36:45.170 --> 04:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
um a big change is that it remits the
 
04:36:48.349 --> 04:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
bill would change where the swept
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
revenues go to it would still be
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
collected by the municipalities as it is
 
04:36:56.209 --> 04:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
now they do the billing they'd receive a
 
04:36:58.789 --> 04:36:58.799 align:start position:0%
warrant from the commissioner of the
 
04:37:00.910 --> 04:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
identifying the the amount of money that
 
04:37:08.209 --> 04:37:08.219 align:start position:0%
they needed to raise by applying the tax
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
to their residents and uh and the rate
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
at an equalized level
 
04:37:20.269 --> 04:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
um in this current year is down to 1.875
 
04:37:23.570 --> 04:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
um it used to be uh it was 1.925 last
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
year and 2.060 the year before uh so the
 
04:37:32.330 --> 04:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
the warrant comes in the uh local uh
 
04:37:34.330 --> 04:37:34.340 align:start position:0%
local locality sends out the bill
 
04:37:37.131 --> 04:37:37.141 align:start position:0%
collects the tax
 
04:37:39.970 --> 04:37:39.980 align:start position:0%
um the tax comes in the money comes in
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
the money then is sent over by the
 
04:37:48.410 --> 04:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
municipality to the school system
 
04:37:48.420 --> 04:37:49.551 align:start position:0%
municipality to the school system
um

04:37:49.551 --> 04:37:49.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
for school expenditures
 
04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
um the uh under the law the purpose of
 
04:37:58.609 --> 04:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
this tax is to raise money for the
 
04:38:02.051 --> 04:38:02.061 align:start position:0%
adequate education formula funding and
 
04:38:05.449 --> 04:38:05.459 align:start position:0%
in Most states it's it's not sufficient
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
to fully fund that so most school
 
04:38:11.150 --> 04:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
districts receive the money from the
 
04:38:14.631 --> 04:38:14.641 align:start position:0%
um from the municipality and then get
 
04:38:16.730 --> 04:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
additional grants from the state from
 
04:38:19.849 --> 04:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund to fill out the
 
04:38:23.650 --> 04:38:23.660 align:start position:0%
adequacy commitment but there are 33
 
04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
cities and towns today that where the
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
the swept amount exceeds
 
04:38:35.709 --> 04:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
the education adequacy
 
04:38:38.990 --> 04:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
calculated amount and those are the
 
04:38:41.330 --> 04:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
so-called excess swept towns right now
 
04:38:44.390 --> 04:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
that excess swept money for most of
 
04:38:48.289 --> 04:38:48.299 align:start position:0%
these uh excess swept towns
 
04:38:50.330 --> 04:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
um goes then towards other school
 
04:38:54.289 --> 04:38:54.299 align:start position:0%
expense expenditures that are not uh
 
04:38:56.631 --> 04:38:56.641 align:start position:0%
that are above the adequate education
 
04:38:56.641 --> 04:38:58.189 align:start position:0%
that are above the adequate education
amount

04:38:58.189 --> 04:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
amount
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
um there are there are 17 except
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that they're all uh
 
04:39:03.119 --> 04:39:04.789 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that they're all uh
townships

04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
townships
 
04:39:07.131 --> 04:39:07.141 align:start position:0%
um they receive uh the sweat they
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
collect the swept money just like uh
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
everybody else but they don't have any
 
04:39:13.849 --> 04:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
education expenses these 17 that I'm
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
talking about and so in that case I
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
believe the money goes to offset other
 
04:39:22.131 --> 04:39:22.141 align:start position:0%
municipal or County expenditures
 
04:39:24.650 --> 04:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
um it's uh not for education at all
 
04:39:26.890 --> 04:39:26.900 align:start position:0%
that's the excess swept
 
04:39:29.570 --> 04:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
and under the bill that would no longer
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
be retained locally it would go all
 
04:39:35.949 --> 04:39:35.959 align:start position:0%
Swift collections would go after
 
04:39:38.990 --> 04:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
netting out the cost of collection and
 
04:39:41.208 --> 04:39:41.218 align:start position:0%
the cost of promoting the property tax
 
04:39:43.448 --> 04:39:43.458 align:start position:0%
relief program the
 
04:39:45.708 --> 04:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities would send all of the
 
04:39:49.368 --> 04:39:49.378 align:start position:0%
money to the Department of Revenue
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
Administration for deposit into the
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
04:39:57.410 --> 04:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
so that's the change there that that the
 
04:39:58.730 --> 04:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
money so sent
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
would include this excess sweat money
 
04:40:03.770 --> 04:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
that I've just spoken about which totals
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
today about 26 million dollars
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
that's the swept reform side you turn to
 
04:40:13.130 --> 04:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
the low and moderate homeowners property
 
04:40:15.410 --> 04:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
tax relief program
 
04:40:18.350 --> 04:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
um the ra would continue to administer
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
that program it's an existing program as
 
04:40:22.670 --> 04:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
you probably all know
 
04:40:26.750 --> 04:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
um administered today by the dra and the
 
04:40:29.630 --> 04:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
dra would continue to administer it but
 
04:40:31.610 --> 04:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
it would be a much more generous program
 
04:40:31.620 --> 04:40:34.368 align:start position:0%
it would be a much more generous program
the

04:40:34.368 --> 04:40:34.378 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:36.170 --> 04:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
the relief
 
04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
that would be available and I'll get to
 
04:40:41.330 --> 04:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
that in a minute the formulas but the
 
04:40:43.390 --> 04:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
the relief
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:40:45.440 --> 04:40:47.208 align:start position:0%
would be
capped

04:40:47.208 --> 04:40:47.218 align:start position:0%
capped
 
04:40:50.750 --> 04:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
at 25 million dollars Statewide
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
which is about equal to that 25 or 26
 
04:40:56.810 --> 04:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
million dollar excess swept figure that
 
04:41:00.830 --> 04:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
I mentioned uh just a few minutes ago or
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
a short time ago
 
04:41:02.400 --> 04:41:03.110 align:start position:0%
a short time ago
um

04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
and so the reform is fully paid for by
 
04:41:09.110 --> 04:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
that excess swept money
 
04:41:09.120 --> 04:41:10.368 align:start position:0%
that excess swept money
um

04:41:10.368 --> 04:41:10.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:14.570 --> 04:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
the uh the relief is calculated by
 
04:41:14.580 --> 04:41:15.708 align:start position:0%
the uh the relief is calculated by
applying

04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
applying
 
04:41:17.930 --> 04:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
not just the Statewide education
 
04:41:19.788 --> 04:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
property tax rate
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
but also the local school tax rate
 
04:41:23.280 --> 04:41:25.368 align:start position:0%
but also the local school tax rate
combined

04:41:25.368 --> 04:41:25.378 align:start position:0%
combined
 
04:41:29.770 --> 04:41:29.780 align:start position:0%
against uh the homo the homeowners
 
04:41:32.448 --> 04:41:32.458 align:start position:0%
property value up to
 
04:41:37.070 --> 04:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
but not above 150 150 000 the current
 
04:41:39.288 --> 04:41:39.298 align:start position:0%
limit is a hundred thousand dollars
 
04:41:42.530 --> 04:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
so we'd have a a rate that would be that
 
04:41:46.670 --> 04:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
roughly two dollars of the swept
 
04:41:49.970 --> 04:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
and further swept and uh then whatever
 
04:41:52.190 --> 04:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
the local school tax rate is which
 
04:41:55.310 --> 04:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
varies from in some mostly excess sweat
 
04:41:58.250 --> 04:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
towns uh in the two dollar range all the
 
04:41:59.868 --> 04:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
way up to um
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
um eighteen dollars sometimes more than
 
04:42:06.590 --> 04:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
that for the education property
 
04:42:10.250 --> 04:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
the local school tax side of the rate so
 
04:42:11.930 --> 04:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
that entire rate would be applied
 
04:42:14.050 --> 04:42:14.060 align:start position:0%
against 150 000
 
04:42:18.050 --> 04:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
and the for the poorest
 
04:42:18.060 --> 04:42:20.170 align:start position:0%
and the for the poorest
homeowner

04:42:20.170 --> 04:42:20.180 align:start position:0%
homeowner
 
04:42:23.690 --> 04:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
the the result of that calculation would
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
be the relief available except that it
 
04:42:28.250 --> 04:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
would be capped at one thousand dollars
 
04:42:31.490 --> 04:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
for any particular claimant
 
04:42:31.500 --> 04:42:32.270 align:start position:0%
for any particular claimant
um

04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:37.550 --> 04:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
and the eligibility for this relief the
 
04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
numbers are in the bill I don't think I
 
04:42:41.570 --> 04:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
can go through them but it would start
 
04:42:43.310 --> 04:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
at twenty thousand dollars if you're
 
04:42:45.050 --> 04:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
below twenty thousand dollars and you're
 
04:42:47.810 --> 04:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
single and you have a home
 
04:42:49.368 --> 04:42:49.378 align:start position:0%
um that's worth more than a hundred and
 
04:42:51.770 --> 04:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars the relief you'd
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
get would be
 
04:42:56.030 --> 04:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
um would be the
 
04:42:59.690 --> 04:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
the rate in your town times the hundred
 
04:43:01.128 --> 04:43:01.138 align:start position:0%
and fifty thousand dollars would be a
 
04:43:04.250 --> 04:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of that calculation
 
04:43:06.650 --> 04:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
um if you had income above twenty
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars but we're below the uh
 
04:43:13.730 --> 04:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
the top level of fifty five thousand
 
04:43:17.030 --> 04:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
dollars you'd get some relief the relief
 
04:43:19.010 --> 04:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
would go down as your income went up
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
basically a slope down of relief as your
 
04:43:25.730 --> 04:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
income went up to the cutoff point for
 
04:43:27.050 --> 04:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
that single person and there are
 
04:43:28.430 --> 04:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
different numbers for
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
for married people
 
04:43:34.190 --> 04:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
um substantial relief way above what's
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
currently available under the existing
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
formula under the existing formula the
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
maximum relief to that single person
 
04:43:43.930 --> 04:43:43.940 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:43:43.940 --> 04:43:45.550 align:start position:0%
would be
187.50

04:43:45.550 --> 04:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
187.50
 
04:43:48.850 --> 04:43:48.860 align:start position:0%
whereas in this this bill it would be
 
04:43:51.708 --> 04:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
in the typical situation it would be
 
04:43:53.570 --> 04:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
well above a thousand dollars would be
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
capped at a thousand dollars
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
um and the last uh notice that there is
 
04:44:00.650 --> 04:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
a study committee that the Bill calls
 
04:44:00.660 --> 04:44:01.730 align:start position:0%
a study committee that the Bill calls
for

04:44:01.730 --> 04:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
um and that study committee will look at
 
04:44:09.410 --> 04:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
some key some very important questions
 
04:44:10.810 --> 04:44:10.820 align:start position:0%
one is
 
04:44:13.628 --> 04:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
how to extend property relief
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
effectively to tenants
 
04:44:19.250 --> 04:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
those rents effectively reflect
 
04:44:23.208 --> 04:44:23.218 align:start position:0%
uh High property tax rates and we need
 
04:44:24.770 --> 04:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
to figure that out and we need a
 
04:44:27.010 --> 04:44:27.020 align:start position:0%
committee to help us figure that out
 
04:44:30.590 --> 04:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
then there's uh the property tax
 
04:44:34.250 --> 04:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
deferral program the the need and the
 
04:44:37.490 --> 04:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
potential of setting up a good program
 
04:44:39.890 --> 04:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
for those homeowners who are in
 
04:44:42.190 --> 04:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
temporary circumstances and unable to
 
04:44:45.910 --> 04:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
pay their bill but need need help
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
with a deferral system so we need to
 
04:44:51.288 --> 04:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
figure that out as well and then the
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
third point is data information that we
 
04:44:56.690 --> 04:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
and Ways and Means are acutely aware of
 
04:44:59.570 --> 04:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
the need for in the in the property
 
04:45:02.810 --> 04:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
realm dra has an enormous amount of
 
04:45:06.590 --> 04:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
information on the on that has built up
 
04:45:08.930 --> 04:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
over the years as they've been assigned
 
04:45:10.850 --> 04:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of equalizing
 
04:45:13.490 --> 04:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
property values across the state it's
 
04:45:17.090 --> 04:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
the system is called Mosaic and uh and
 
04:45:18.830 --> 04:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
we've looked I've looked closely at that
 
04:45:20.948 --> 04:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
I've tried to use it
 
04:45:24.650 --> 04:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative Luna who's the tech Guru
 
04:45:24.660 --> 04:45:26.390 align:start position:0%
representative Luna who's the tech Guru
of

04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:45:28.128 --> 04:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
for the legislature I would say but
 
04:45:29.868 --> 04:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
anyway certainly by the school funding
 
04:45:35.390 --> 04:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
commission uh worked on it uh and uh
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
there were others that have tried but
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
one of the problems is the categories
 
04:45:39.600 --> 04:45:40.430 align:start position:0%
one of the problems is the categories
aren't

04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
04:45:44.330 --> 04:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
particularly useful into which the uh
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
what you have to use are the categories
 
04:45:48.590 --> 04:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
that are used in Mosaic and they don't
 
04:45:50.090 --> 04:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
work very well
 
04:45:52.610 --> 04:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
um so uh that's that's the bill as a
 
04:45:54.788 --> 04:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
whole and I think I'd I'd leave it there
 
04:45:58.490 --> 04:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
and hope that uh we can move quickly to
 
04:46:01.128 --> 04:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
the other testifiers because I'm sure
 
04:46:03.170 --> 04:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
their schedules are tight just as ours
 
04:46:03.180 --> 04:46:04.868 align:start position:0%
their schedules are tight just as ours
are

04:46:04.868 --> 04:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:46:06.650 --> 04:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for your
 
04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
testimony representing representative
 
04:46:11.690 --> 04:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
Bryant uh Brumley yeah thank you Mr
 
04:46:13.368 --> 04:46:13.378 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Ames um
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
this is indeed a complicated topic
 
04:46:19.250 --> 04:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not an expert at all
 
04:46:22.128 --> 04:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
but I live in the Portsmouth kind of
 
04:46:23.930 --> 04:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
general area and they see in the local
 
04:46:23.940 --> 04:46:25.310 align:start position:0%
general area and they see in the local
papers

04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
papers
 
04:46:27.410 --> 04:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
people in Portsmouth are calling this
 
04:46:30.050 --> 04:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
return to donor towns because I think
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
they get hurt by this
 
04:46:35.390 --> 04:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
can you can you is this tell me is this
 
04:46:39.890 --> 04:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.900 --> 04:46:40.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:46:40.490 --> 04:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
I wasn't I wasn't present when you
 
04:46:46.850 --> 04:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh when that donor Town controversy
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
erupted so uh so that's one point
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I I use the phrase excess swept towns
 
04:46:59.690 --> 04:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
rather than donor towns remember there's
 
04:47:03.410 --> 04:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
no change in this bill in the rate
 
04:47:07.490 --> 04:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
um so the uh we're not going up and in
 
04:47:10.128 --> 04:47:10.138 align:start position:0%
this bill proposing
 
04:47:14.270 --> 04:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
um an increased collection of money this
 
04:47:17.150 --> 04:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
is a Statewide one thing I I failed to
 
04:47:21.288 --> 04:47:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:23.930 --> 04:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
and it's subject to the Constitutional
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
Provisions regarding uniformity and
 
04:47:26.878 --> 04:47:29.330 align:start position:0%
Provisions regarding uniformity and
proportionality

04:47:29.330 --> 04:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
proportionality
 
04:47:31.970 --> 04:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
um in the materials I gave you the last
 
04:47:34.190 --> 04:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
page on the back of it there's an
 
04:47:39.170 --> 04:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
extensive uh excerpt from a decision by
 
04:47:41.690 --> 04:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Superior Court in the
 
04:47:43.930 --> 04:47:43.940 align:start position:0%
Londonderry case
 
04:47:49.010 --> 04:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
and just a quote from it that the court
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
in that case concluded that the uh the
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill before it which was enacted creates
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
a non-uniform tax rate and the court
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
finds that no constitutional
 
04:48:03.050 --> 04:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
justification can be articulated to
 
04:48:05.090 --> 04:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
permit the retention of those excess
 
04:48:06.590 --> 04:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
funds by the property Rich
 
04:48:09.770 --> 04:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
municipalities so I think the law says
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
this is the way it has to be
 
04:48:15.050 --> 04:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
um now that's not I said that uh too
 
04:48:17.390 --> 04:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
definitively as I said when we were
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
talking about Wayfair
 
04:48:21.890 --> 04:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
um you never know with constitutional
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
law and how the court would come out but
 
04:48:26.690 --> 04:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'd say the odds are that if this case
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
gets to the Supreme Court the excess
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
swept component of the law as it sits
 
04:48:37.970 --> 04:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
today would be thrown out
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing to say is that uh
 
04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a relatively small
 
04:48:45.650 --> 04:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
amount of money and a very small
 
04:48:50.570 --> 04:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
property rate change for uh the towns he
 
04:48:54.110 --> 04:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned Sportsmen near you I think is
 
04:48:54.120 --> 04:48:55.850 align:start position:0%
mentioned Sportsmen near you I think is
Newington

04:48:55.850 --> 04:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
Newington
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
um rise not far away Newcastle is not
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
far away they're all excess swept towns
 
04:49:03.288 --> 04:49:03.298 align:start position:0%
they also have a very significant
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
property tax base in my charts uh in my
 
04:49:06.958 --> 04:49:07.990 align:start position:0%
property tax base in my charts uh in my
chart

04:49:07.990 --> 04:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
chart
 
04:49:10.430 --> 04:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
I show
 
04:49:14.208 --> 04:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
the differences in in the median
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil which is one way to
 
04:49:18.288 --> 04:49:18.298 align:start position:0%
sort of compare from one town to the
 
04:49:20.570 --> 04:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
next for the excess swept towns the
 
04:49:23.090 --> 04:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
median valuation per pupil is 4.1
 
04:49:24.530 --> 04:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:49:27.350 --> 04:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
for the cities and towns across the
 
04:49:30.650 --> 04:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
state it's 1.1 million dollars huge
 
04:49:30.660 --> 04:49:32.208 align:start position:0%
state it's 1.1 million dollars huge
difference

04:49:32.208 --> 04:49:32.218 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
um the amount of Education spending per
 
04:49:36.890 --> 04:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
pupil that the excess sweat towns are
 
04:49:39.770 --> 04:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
able to manage is 28 thousand dollars
 
04:49:43.070 --> 04:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
per pupil for the towns across the state
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's about 17.5
 
04:49:49.970 --> 04:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
17 500 per pupil
 
04:49:53.570 --> 04:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
um big differences so uh and if you if
 
04:49:55.788 --> 04:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
you took the the rates in those times
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
the property rates Town rates in those
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
excess sweat towns for school
 
04:50:03.170 --> 04:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
expenditures and applied them against
 
04:50:05.750 --> 04:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
the higher value recess
 
04:50:07.850 --> 04:50:07.860 align:start position:0%
real estate that they have the real
 
04:50:10.970 --> 04:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
estate there does cost more the actual
 
04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
tax paid by the typical homeowner is
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
less than the actual tax paid by the
 
04:50:20.330 --> 04:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
typical homeowner in say Claremont or
 
04:50:22.850 --> 04:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
any other any number of other My Own
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
Town Jeffrey
 
04:50:28.090 --> 04:50:28.100 align:start position:0%
um so uh perhaps the donor Town
 
04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
controversy will be reignited by this I
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
hope not I hope that those towns will
 
04:50:37.250 --> 04:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
see that it's a very small price that
 
04:50:40.010 --> 04:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
they're they would pay for enabling a
 
04:50:41.690 --> 04:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program that will
 
04:50:42.890 --> 04:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
help their
 
04:50:45.530 --> 04:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
their taxpayers as much as it helps
 
04:50:48.170 --> 04:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the state and without
 
04:50:50.510 --> 04:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
funding for this taxpayer relief program
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen there's a
 
04:50:55.550 --> 04:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
long-winded answer I'm sorry let me say
 
04:50:58.250 --> 04:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
something about the donor time when we
 
04:51:01.128 --> 04:51:01.138 align:start position:0%
passed the Statewide property tax back
 
04:51:04.190 --> 04:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
in around 2000
 
04:51:08.628 --> 04:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
it was an equalized value taxed on
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
property by the state and was supposed
 
04:51:13.550 --> 04:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
to come into the state but what the
 
04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
state did in their wisdom they made a
 
04:51:18.050 --> 04:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
mistake what they said is quote you hold
 
04:51:21.170 --> 04:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
on to it in the towns and you can use it
 
04:51:23.090 --> 04:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
04:51:25.850 --> 04:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
the share of adequacy
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:51:30.110 --> 04:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
that sounded good but then they found
 
04:51:32.448 --> 04:51:32.458 align:start position:0%
out there was a number of times that
 
04:51:35.810 --> 04:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
they raised more than that
 
04:51:40.368 --> 04:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
and so that the town says uh
 
04:51:40.378 --> 04:51:41.990 align:start position:0%
and so that the town says uh
we

04:51:41.990 --> 04:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:51:44.510 --> 04:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
we don't want to give that away that
 
04:51:46.128 --> 04:51:46.138 align:start position:0%
should be learned to us
 
04:51:48.650 --> 04:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
it should have been going to the states
 
04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy for everybody in the state
 
04:51:57.650 --> 04:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
we try to change that back probably a
 
04:52:00.410 --> 04:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
few years later and we've got cream
 
04:52:02.330 --> 04:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
because everybody came out of the
 
04:52:04.610 --> 04:52:04.620 align:start position:0%
woodwork this is a donor town it's not a
 
04:52:07.970 --> 04:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
donut town but you that's what's going
 
04:52:10.310 --> 04:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
to happen in this bill
 
04:52:12.530 --> 04:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
goes through again so
 
04:52:17.330 --> 04:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:21.410 --> 04:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh the next one is you're also looking
 
04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:26.930 --> 04:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any other questions so
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:39.650 --> 04:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:43.250 --> 04:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
a large reporter I think representative
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
luno would be uh representative if he's
 
04:52:46.320 --> 04:52:47.650 align:start position:0%
luno would be uh representative if he's
available

04:52:47.650 --> 04:52:47.660 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:56.270 --> 04:52:56.280 align:start position:0%

um

04:53:06.590 --> 04:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%

um as um as representative Ames uh said
 
04:53:58.190 --> 04:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
I I chaired the school funding uh
 
04:54:00.110 --> 04:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
commission which released its final
 
04:54:02.090 --> 04:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
report back in December and will
 
04:54:04.850 --> 04:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
actually be we've been we've invited all
 
04:54:07.730 --> 04:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
um uh senators and representatives to a
 
04:54:10.490 --> 04:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
briefing on this on on Monday next week
 
04:54:12.288 --> 04:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon next week it's noticed
 
04:54:14.390 --> 04:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the calendar so anyway
 
04:54:16.850 --> 04:54:16.860 align:start position:0%
um funding a public education continues
 
04:54:19.010 --> 04:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
to be an issue for New Hampshire and the
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
subject of many Court decisions and
 
04:54:22.850 --> 04:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
ongoing in cases the New Hampshire
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has long held that the
 
04:54:27.470 --> 04:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide a
 
04:54:29.090 --> 04:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate education
 
04:54:31.910 --> 04:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
rests with the state the school funding
 
04:54:34.128 --> 04:54:34.138 align:start position:0%
commission sees the objective of State
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy as to ensure sufficient
 
04:54:39.470 --> 04:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
resources are available in every school
 
04:54:41.930 --> 04:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
district in order for all students in
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
the state to have the opportunity for
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate education
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
well-designed fiscal policy should
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
consider the full costs of educating
 
04:54:55.310 --> 04:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
students and recognize that fiscal
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
capacity varies significantly among
 
04:55:01.010 --> 04:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and taxpayers and
 
04:55:03.288 --> 04:55:03.298 align:start position:0%
thoughtful consideration of fiscal
 
04:55:06.350 --> 04:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
policy for Education involves many
 
04:55:08.810 --> 04:55:08.820 align:start position:0%
interlocking Parts all of which are
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
important in improving student and
 
04:55:12.530 --> 04:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
taxpayer equity
 
04:55:14.510 --> 04:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
the granite state is much to be proud of
 
04:55:16.850 --> 04:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
when it comes to public education New
 
04:55:18.288 --> 04:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is ranked third in the nation
 
04:55:21.788 --> 04:55:21.798 align:start position:0%
by U.S news and World Report
 
04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%

04:55:39.050 --> 04:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
of course averages don't tell the whole
 
04:55:40.910 --> 04:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
story while New Hampshire's state
 
04:55:42.530 --> 04:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
average student outcomes are among the
 
04:55:45.050 --> 04:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
best in the country that's not true for
 
04:55:46.610 --> 04:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
all school districts
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
average performance by District Falls
 
04:55:51.410 --> 04:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
over a wide range with some districts
 
04:55:54.170 --> 04:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
well above State average and others so
 
04:55:56.330 --> 04:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
far below average that it calls into
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
question whether there was an
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity for any students in those
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
districts to access an adequate
 
04:56:03.360 --> 04:56:04.910 align:start position:0%
districts to access an adequate
education

04:56:04.910 --> 04:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:56:07.490 --> 04:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's average total Public
 
04:56:09.948 --> 04:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
School spending is in the top 20 percent
 
04:56:11.530 --> 04:56:11.540 align:start position:0%
of all states
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
though it's total spending per pupil is
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
exceeded by several other New England
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
states however the portion of the total
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
spending comprised of state budget
 
04:56:24.050 --> 04:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
support is the lowest of all states
 
04:56:26.810 --> 04:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
while the while the low share of state
 
04:56:29.208 --> 04:56:29.218 align:start position:0%
budget support for public schools can
 
04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
contribute to student inequity across
 
04:56:33.530 --> 04:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
the state it's not totally responsible
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
for the lack of student equity a
 
04:56:39.050 --> 04:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
principal culprit for student inequity
 
04:56:41.690 --> 04:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
is the method for allocating the state
 
04:56:44.208 --> 04:56:44.218 align:start position:0%
budget resources between poorer and
 
04:56:46.010 --> 04:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
wealthier districts

04:57:43.070 --> 04:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
as District poverty rates increase

04:57:48.830 --> 04:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has has significant

variation across municipalities and
 
04:57:54.110 --> 04:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
equalized property valuations used to
 
04:57:56.510 --> 04:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
generate the local Revenue necessary to
 
04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
fund Municipal and school budgets
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
the most property poor districts have an
 
04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
equalized property value per pupil of
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
less than four hundred thousand while
 
04:58:07.128 --> 04:58:07.138 align:start position:0%
property wealthy districts have
 
04:58:09.230 --> 04:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
equalized property valuations in the
 
04:58:11.690 --> 04:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars property wealthy
 
04:58:13.310 --> 04:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
districts generate more Revenue than
 
04:58:16.010 --> 04:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
property poor districts per dollar of
 
04:58:17.570 --> 04:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
04:58:19.550 --> 04:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
a property tax rate
 
04:58:22.128 --> 04:58:22.138 align:start position:0%
this means property poor districts have
 
04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
higher tax rates in order to generate
 
04:58:27.230 --> 04:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
the same revenue for schools as property
 
04:58:29.810 --> 04:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
wealthy districts some property poor
 
04:58:31.490 --> 04:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
districts have a local education
 
04:58:34.208 --> 04:58:34.218 align:start position:0%
property tax rate of more than 20
 
04:58:37.250 --> 04:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand while some property
 
04:58:39.050 --> 04:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
wealthy districts have an education
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
property tax rate of less than two
 
04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand
 
04:58:44.810 --> 04:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also has significant
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
variation in capacity to pay within
 
04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the commission heard
 
04:58:52.250 --> 04:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony to that effect for
 
04:58:54.110 --> 04:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
example a homeowner and a property
 
04:58:56.208 --> 04:58:56.218 align:start position:0%
wealthy District may live on a fixed
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
income and have limited Financial
 
04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
Resources when compared to others who
 
04:59:02.208 --> 04:59:02.218 align:start position:0%
live in that district and the state's
 
04:59:04.850 --> 04:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program has outdated
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements which limit its
 
04:59:09.170 --> 04:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
use right now
 
04:59:10.970 --> 04:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
compared to other states such as
 
04:59:13.550 --> 04:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New Hampshire's failure to
 
04:59:15.350 --> 04:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
direct resources to districts with
 
04:59:17.510 --> 04:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
limited fiscal capacity and provide
 
04:59:19.690 --> 04:59:19.700 align:start position:0%
effective property tax relief programs
 
04:59:22.550 --> 04:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
contributes significantly to student and
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayer inequities
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
the state property tax was introduced in
 
04:59:29.930 --> 04:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
term the state property tax was
 
04:59:31.730 --> 04:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
introduced in terms we would recognize
 
04:59:35.570 --> 04:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
today uh back in 1919 had a rate of
 
04:59:37.190 --> 04:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
three dollars and fifty cents per
 
04:59:37.200 --> 04:59:38.330 align:start position:0%
three dollars and fifty cents per
thousand

04:59:38.330 --> 04:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
04:59:41.330 --> 04:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
over the years the state property taxed
 
04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
for various classes of property has been
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
set at a rate between zero dollars per
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
thousand and six dollars and sixty cents
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
per thousand
 
04:59:52.730 --> 04:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
in fy06 the legislature set a fixed
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
amount of 363 million dollars to be
 
04:59:58.368 --> 04:59:58.378 align:start position:0%
raised by the state property tax and let
 
05:00:00.650 --> 05:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
the rate float based on the amount to be
 
05:00:02.330 --> 05:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
raised divided by the Statewide
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
equalized property valuation in FY 20
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
the equalized property tax rate was 1.93
 
05:00:10.850 --> 05:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
per thousand
 
05:00:13.730 --> 05:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
local education property taxes range
 
05:00:17.570 --> 05:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
from about 52 cents per thousand uh in
 
05:00:20.090 --> 05:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
Hearts location to twenty four dollars
 
05:00:22.010 --> 05:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
and two cents per thousand in
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
Charlestown that means the owner of a
 
05:00:25.610 --> 05:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand dollar home in
 
05:00:26.708 --> 05:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
one Community
 
05:00:28.850 --> 05:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
which is pretty close to the state
 
05:00:31.368 --> 05:00:31.378 align:start position:0%
average in in New Hampshire could pay
 
05:00:33.948 --> 05:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
the same amount of uh same amount in
 
05:00:36.288 --> 05:00:36.298 align:start position:0%
property taxes as the owner of the three
 
05:00:39.410 --> 05:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
million dollar home in another community
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
nearly three quarters of New Hampshire
 
05:00:43.368 --> 05:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
state and local dollars raised for
 
05:00:46.970 --> 05:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
Education come from property tax revenue
 
05:00:49.788 --> 05:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
in 2000 a commission to analyze the
 
05:00:51.590 --> 05:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
economic impacts of various school
 
05:00:54.050 --> 05:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
funding Revenue options was created by
 
05:00:57.170 --> 05:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
then Governor Shaheen one one takeaway
 
05:01:01.250 --> 05:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
from this 2000 report was that given the
 
05:01:03.170 --> 05:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
complexity of administering the property
 
05:01:05.390 --> 05:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
tax across hundreds of municipalities
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would have to devote
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
considerably more resources to
 
05:01:11.330 --> 05:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
administering the state property tax
 
05:01:13.730 --> 05:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
than it does So currently back in 2000
 
05:01:16.128 --> 05:01:16.138 align:start position:0%
so that the fairness of the tax does not
 
05:01:18.410 --> 05:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
continue to be called into question or
 
05:01:19.850 --> 05:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
challenged in court
 
05:01:22.010 --> 05:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
but subsequently the constitutionally of
 
05:01:24.288 --> 05:01:24.298 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property tax was
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
called into question forming the basis
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
of the point
 
05:01:29.930 --> 05:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
um you know styled is Sorel versus state
 
05:01:32.750 --> 05:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this is back in 1999.
 
05:01:34.910 --> 05:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
the Court ruled the state property tax
 
05:01:34.920 --> 05:01:36.470 align:start position:0%
the Court ruled the state property tax
unconstitutional

05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
05:01:38.930 --> 05:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
because the state did not have systems
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
in place to provide equalized Statewide
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
property valuations outside of the local
 
05:01:47.288 --> 05:01:47.298 align:start position:0%
property tax jurisdictions
 
05:01:49.610 --> 05:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
following this decision the general
 
05:01:51.470 --> 05:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
court made changes to how the state
 
05:01:53.288 --> 05:01:53.298 align:start position:0%
property tax was collected and used
 
05:01:55.910 --> 05:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
currently the pro State Property Tax is
 
05:01:58.128 --> 05:01:58.138 align:start position:0%
collected locally and applied to the
 
05:01:59.930 --> 05:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
municipality's total cost of an
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
education is determined by Statute if
 
05:02:03.770 --> 05:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
the amount of the State Property Tax
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
collected exceeds this cost the state
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
issues an additional Grant to the
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
municipality in the amount of the excess
 
05:02:12.350 --> 05:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
with the stipulation that it be used for
 
05:02:13.850 --> 05:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
public education
 
05:02:17.448 --> 05:02:17.458 align:start position:0%
by 2014 the dra had implemented a
 
05:02:19.788 --> 05:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
comprehensive system called Mosaic to
 
05:02:21.650 --> 05:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
evaluate property sales and develop
 
05:02:23.330 --> 05:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
Equalization ratios for all
 
05:02:23.340 --> 05:02:24.910 align:start position:0%
Equalization ratios for all
municipalities

05:02:24.910 --> 05:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
05:02:27.110 --> 05:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony was heard by the
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
commission attesting to the efficacy of
 
05:02:31.610 --> 05:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
the system In fairness of equalized
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
um how much longer do you have
 
05:02:42.170 --> 05:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
I can I can wrap this up but it this is
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
you know the the the
 
05:02:48.890 --> 05:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
um I hate to bring yeah we have 10 other
 
05:02:51.128 --> 05:02:51.138 align:start position:0%
people want to
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay so um if you want if you have it uh
 
05:02:59.770 --> 05:02:59.780 align:start position:0%
as a document you could summarize
 
05:03:03.708 --> 05:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
I'll certainly summarize it and send it
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
um uh I I did want to just make a make a
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
quick example here since we're talking
 
05:03:12.170 --> 05:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
about excess swept and the state's
 
05:03:12.180 --> 05:03:13.610 align:start position:0%
about excess swept and the state's
changes

05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
changes
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
um uh uh uh to to how uh the state
 
05:03:22.010 --> 05:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
property tax is is is is is is done but
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
under under this bill House Bill 504
 
05:03:25.440 --> 05:03:26.090 align:start position:0%
under under this bill House Bill 504
um

05:03:26.090 --> 05:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:30.050 --> 05:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh the the state property tax would be
 
05:03:33.410 --> 05:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
collected locally and sent um in whole
 
05:03:36.830 --> 05:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the state and just as an
 
05:03:36.840 --> 05:03:38.150 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the state and just as an
example

05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:03:40.610 --> 05:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
um uh according to the doe data
 
05:03:42.530 --> 05:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
portsmouth's cost of an adequate
 
05:03:44.690 --> 05:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
education is about 10 million dollars
 
05:03:47.810 --> 05:03:47.820 align:start position:0%
they raised 12 million from their State
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
Property Tax based on their their
 
05:03:53.868 --> 05:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
valuation in order to raise that
 
05:03:55.670 --> 05:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
difference two million dollar low two
 
05:03:57.708 --> 05:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
million dollars through local property
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
taxes it would be 30 cents per thousand
 
05:04:03.410 --> 05:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
of valuation so approximately three
 
05:04:04.970 --> 05:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars on a one million dollar
 
05:04:07.970 --> 05:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
home and don't get me wrong Mr chair 300
 
05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
is a lot of money especially for people
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
living on fixed incomes or moderate
 
05:04:14.270 --> 05:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
incomes but that's exactly who House
 
05:04:17.330 --> 05:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
Bill 504 is designed to help and this
 
05:04:19.570 --> 05:04:19.580 align:start position:0%
example is well within the scope of the
 
05:04:22.368 --> 05:04:22.378 align:start position:0%
tax relief
 
05:04:25.490 --> 05:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap it up there and uh and happy
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
to take any questions and to send um
 
05:04:31.970 --> 05:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:36.128 --> 05:04:36.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:45.530 --> 05:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%

um thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:05:45.288 --> 05:05:45.298 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to testify
 
05:05:49.310 --> 05:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill I will not be
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
long I want to say first uh for the
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
record my name is Bill ardinger I'm a
 
05:05:56.208 --> 05:05:56.218 align:start position:0%
tax attorney at a local Law Firm wrath
 
05:05:59.570 --> 05:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
young and Pignatelli our firm represents
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh many uh businesses and also uh
 
05:06:07.128 --> 05:06:07.138 align:start position:0%
lobbies uh members of our firm Lobby I
 
05:06:10.788 --> 05:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
am here not on behalf of any client but
 
05:06:15.530 --> 05:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
on my own behalf anything I testify to I
 
05:06:17.330 --> 05:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
would ask the committee to recognize is
 
05:06:19.788 --> 05:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
my own opinion it is not the opinion of
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
any of our clients or
 
05:06:25.368 --> 05:06:25.378 align:start position:0%
um of any other member of my firm I
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
would um like to say that I'm here
 
05:06:31.010 --> 05:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
because I had the pleasure of serving as
 
05:06:32.690 --> 05:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
a member of the education funding
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
commission with um representative Ames
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative luno and others uh I was
 
05:06:41.570 --> 05:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh the designee or the appointment of
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
the governor of the state and it was a
 
05:06:48.590 --> 05:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
very uh positive experience on this bill
 
05:06:52.850 --> 05:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
which is about tax policy I support it
 
05:06:57.708 --> 05:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
because I believe New Hampshire has not
 
05:07:00.650 --> 05:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
taken the steps yet that other states
 
05:07:04.190 --> 05:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
have taken to make the property tax
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
system fairer for all property taxpayers
 
05:07:11.330 --> 05:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
who are subject to the tax the
 
05:07:13.788 --> 05:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
commissions were concluded that the
 
05:07:17.690 --> 05:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
property tax is like any tax nobody
 
05:07:20.448 --> 05:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
wants to pay a tax but the property tax
 
05:07:24.410 --> 05:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
is a good tax to this extent it is a
 
05:07:28.010 --> 05:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
stable tax it provides resources that
 
05:07:30.650 --> 05:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
have have been used to support the
 
05:07:32.930 --> 05:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
construction of our Public School
 
05:07:35.868 --> 05:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
Systems which is are the most important
 
05:07:39.708 --> 05:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
assets of our public sector here and and
 
05:07:43.070 --> 05:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
the the balance between a stable tax
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
base and supporting
 
05:07:48.170 --> 05:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
um important public assets like our
 
05:07:51.770 --> 05:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
common school system is is very good for
 
05:07:54.530 --> 05:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
Education policy as a matter of tax
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
policy however the property tax has
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
flaws like every tax system the property
 
05:08:05.208 --> 05:08:05.218 align:start position:0%
tax in sometimes applies to people of
 
05:08:08.448 --> 05:08:08.458 align:start position:0%
low income who don't have the regular
 
05:08:12.590 --> 05:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
cash flow that they can easily use to
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
pay their tax liability representative
 
05:08:19.310 --> 05:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
Ames and House Bill 504 is puts a a
 
05:08:23.448 --> 05:08:23.458 align:start position:0%
spotlight on improving and fixing
 
05:08:26.150 --> 05:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
um this problem with our current
 
05:08:30.050 --> 05:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
property Tech system the right way to
 
05:08:32.448 --> 05:08:32.458 align:start position:0%
provide protections to low-income
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is a direct and robust rule
 
05:08:39.170 --> 05:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
that applies directly to the intended
 
05:08:42.530 --> 05:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the wrong way to provide
 
05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
protections to low-income taxpayers is
 
05:08:48.410 --> 05:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
to protect one whole Community under the
 
05:08:51.670 --> 05:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
name which is a misnomer donor town
 
05:08:55.250 --> 05:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
which then protects not just low-income
 
05:08:57.770 --> 05:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in that Community but protects
 
05:09:00.770 --> 05:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
very wealthy taxpayers who are perfectly
 
05:09:04.128 --> 05:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
able to pay their fair share of the
 
05:09:06.650 --> 05:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
obligation of supporting Municipal needs
 
05:09:09.410 --> 05:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
and public schools I would like to say
 
05:09:09.420 --> 05:09:10.730 align:start position:0%
and public schools I would like to say
that

05:09:10.730 --> 05:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:09:13.550 --> 05:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
um other aspects of this bill which is
 
05:09:17.628 --> 05:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
to have the collection of the State
 
05:09:19.490 --> 05:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
Property Tax
 
05:09:22.128 --> 05:09:22.138 align:start position:0%
um all the proceeds remitted to the
 
05:09:24.410 --> 05:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
State Treasury and then expended in
 
05:09:27.770 --> 05:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
accordance with a fairer uh tax uh
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
distribution system that protects
 
05:09:32.030 --> 05:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
communities like Claremont where I went
 
05:09:34.010 --> 05:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
to high school and met my wife at
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
Stevens High School so many years ago uh
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
is is the right way to go in my view I
 
05:09:44.270 --> 05:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
think it solves great risks that the
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
state currently faces under the current
 
05:09:50.208 --> 05:09:50.218 align:start position:0%
system which effectively by leaving
 
05:09:54.890 --> 05:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
dollars among wealthy and and poorer
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in particular towns
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh that raises a constitutional question
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
that at some point the state is likely
 
05:10:06.890 --> 05:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
to face I think 504s House Bill 504's
 
05:10:10.128 --> 05:10:10.138 align:start position:0%
effort to address that with a uh
 
05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
remitting the proceeds like the meals
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
and rum Stacks that taxes collected
 
05:10:18.410 --> 05:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
locally and remitted to the state that's
 
05:10:21.170 --> 05:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
all this bill proposes and I think it is
 
05:10:25.490 --> 05:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
a smart way to avoid a a problem in the
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
future that could arise when uh
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of of communities argue hey
 
05:10:34.670 --> 05:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
how come that wealthy taxpayer in that
 
05:10:37.070 --> 05:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
town is getting a tax break when we're
 
05:10:39.470 --> 05:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
not and so with that knowing you have
 
05:10:42.350 --> 05:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
other Witnesses I would just like to say
 
05:10:46.610 --> 05:10:46.620 align:start position:0%

of this commission and the whole team on
 
05:11:00.288 --> 05:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
such an important issue like education
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
funding I look forward to working with
 
05:11:04.490 --> 05:11:04.500 align:start position:0%

05:11:40.550 --> 05:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
have a good way of uh
 
05:11:42.890 --> 05:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
explaining things if you will I thank
 
05:11:44.750 --> 05:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
you representative abrami and it's great
 
05:11:46.970 --> 05:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
to see you and every member if the
 
05:11:48.650 --> 05:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
committee would have me and
 
05:11:51.288 --> 05:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
representative Ames would tolerate me a
 
05:11:53.090 --> 05:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
little bit longer I would love to
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
participate in the work session
 
05:11:59.150 --> 05:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
05:12:02.448 --> 05:12:02.458 align:start position:0%
yes also a quick question I'm glad that
 
05:12:04.670 --> 05:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
you will be coming you would not come to
 
05:12:08.448 --> 05:12:08.458 align:start position:0%
our committee for a long time on and but
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
I I would like to get your perspective
 
05:12:14.930 --> 05:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
on how hard it's going to be to to solve
 
05:12:19.368 --> 05:12:19.378 align:start position:0%
the issues of renters and tuition and a
 
05:12:22.010 --> 05:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
number of other things that don't quite
 
05:12:25.850 --> 05:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
do the job on on the formula that's
 
05:12:27.910 --> 05:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
going not
 
05:12:31.730 --> 05:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
not specifically for the low-income
 
05:12:36.410 --> 05:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
dollars but in the renter case yes
 
05:12:38.868 --> 05:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
and he couldn't respond to that in our
 
05:12:40.670 --> 05:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
work session coming up
 
05:12:42.770 --> 05:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
yes I would I first say to
 
05:12:45.050 --> 05:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
representative Army I love this
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
committee when I was 18 years old I was
 
05:12:50.030 --> 05:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
elected from Cornish and Croydon and
 
05:12:51.770 --> 05:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
proudly served as a member of this
 
05:12:54.530 --> 05:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
committee and and in this case I'm not
 
05:12:57.288 --> 05:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
actually a lobbyist which makes me more
 
05:12:59.628 --> 05:12:59.638 align:start position:0%
confident and comfortable coming before
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
you so and with you so I would also say
 
05:13:02.638 --> 05:13:03.708 align:start position:0%
you so and with you so I would also say
Yes

05:13:03.708 --> 05:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
Yes
 
05:13:05.868 --> 05:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
um other states have faced the renter
 
05:13:08.750 --> 05:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
issue as representative Ames knows uh it
 
05:13:11.570 --> 05:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
is not an easy issue but other states
 
05:13:13.310 --> 05:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
have come up with some pretty clever
 
05:13:16.430 --> 05:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
approaches and a great organization just
 
05:13:18.530 --> 05:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
south of us in Cambridge the Lincoln
 
05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
Land Institute has some great
 
05:13:22.490 --> 05:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative Mommy I think I've been
 
05:13:25.250 --> 05:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
to events there with you in the past uh
 
05:13:27.890 --> 05:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
Daphne Kenyon and others there have some
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
good information on that that I think
 
05:13:31.310 --> 05:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
would help the work session thank you
 
05:13:34.970 --> 05:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay
 
05:13:34.980 --> 05:13:37.150 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay
um

05:13:37.150 --> 05:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:41.390 --> 05:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
to get another view and and there's
 
05:13:43.670 --> 05:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
Richard Stanton
 
05:13:46.610 --> 05:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
and elect representative Stanton Like
 
05:13:49.250 --> 05:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
That official representing himself who
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
opposes and said he needs five minutes
 
05:13:57.170 --> 05:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
I don't see him in the attendees
 
05:13:58.910 --> 05:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
I've looked for him
 
05:13:58.920 --> 05:14:00.470 align:start position:0%
I've looked for him
okay

05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
that saves us five minutes
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
the next is representative Madre Porter
 
05:14:10.368 --> 05:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
elected official from Hillsborough in
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
support and
 
05:14:15.110 --> 05:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
needs three minutes
 
05:14:17.868 --> 05:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
the last three minutes took about 10
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
minutes so
 
05:14:20.890 --> 05:14:20.900 align:start position:0%
everybody takes
 
05:14:25.490 --> 05:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
I am here can you hear me okay yes we
 
05:14:28.128 --> 05:14:28.138 align:start position:0%
can okay a weird thing happened on my
 
05:14:30.770 --> 05:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
computer I'm sorry for the delay thank
 
05:14:32.930 --> 05:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and members of the
 
05:14:34.730 --> 05:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
committee and I will be brief I timed
 
05:14:36.350 --> 05:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
myself at three minutes and eight
 
05:14:38.570 --> 05:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
seconds for the record my name is
 
05:14:40.390 --> 05:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
Marjorie Porter and I represent
 
05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough district one and the towns
 
05:14:45.190 --> 05:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
of Antrim Hillsboro in Windsor
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ames and luno and Mr
 
05:14:49.850 --> 05:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
eardinger have done a fine job here
 
05:14:52.550 --> 05:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
explaining the details of this bill and
 
05:14:54.650 --> 05:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
all the ins and outs of finances that
 
05:14:57.650 --> 05:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
your committee deals with so well but I
 
05:14:59.448 --> 05:14:59.458 align:start position:0%
would like to bring it down now to the
 
05:15:03.050 --> 05:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
local level and how passage of hb504
 
05:15:06.288 --> 05:15:06.298 align:start position:0%
will provide real help to real people
 
05:15:08.750 --> 05:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
specifically I want to talk about my
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
constituents here in Hillsboro
 
05:15:13.550 --> 05:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro is a working class community
 
05:15:16.250 --> 05:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
and is Frugal with its money
 
05:15:18.890 --> 05:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
local boards are careful not to ask too
 
05:15:21.830 --> 05:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
much and to keep annual budget increases
 
05:15:21.840 --> 05:15:22.970 align:start position:0%
much and to keep annual budget increases
small

05:15:22.970 --> 05:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
small
 
05:15:25.128 --> 05:15:25.138 align:start position:0%
I served on the school board for a while
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
and I know how hard that board works to
 
05:15:30.410 --> 05:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
do the best possible for the kids
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
without overburdening the taxpayers
 
05:15:36.650 --> 05:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
the school district is sb2
 
05:15:38.930 --> 05:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
most of the budgets passed in the last
 
05:15:41.810 --> 05:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
10 years have been default level funded
 
05:15:45.530 --> 05:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
budgets there are no frills
 
05:15:48.050 --> 05:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
despite this we have one of the higher
 
05:15:51.110 --> 05:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
tax rates in the state and homeowners
 
05:15:53.150 --> 05:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
have seen their property taxes increase
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
year after year
 
05:15:58.368 --> 05:15:58.378 align:start position:0%
personally the taxes on my modest ranch
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
style home on a small town lot increased
 
05:16:06.530 --> 05:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
20 percent between 2016 and 2020.
 
05:16:08.690 --> 05:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
I thought things might hold steady for
 
05:16:09.890 --> 05:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
us this year
 
05:16:12.070 --> 05:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
as our school tax rate actually
 
05:16:14.930 --> 05:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
decreased by two dollars and forty cents
 
05:16:16.128 --> 05:16:16.138 align:start position:0%
a thousand
 
05:16:18.770 --> 05:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
but that was not to be the housing
 
05:16:21.288 --> 05:16:21.298 align:start position:0%
market is strong and home values have
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
increased there was a reassessment
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
instead of going down property taxes
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
increased once again mine went up
 
05:16:32.628 --> 05:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
another 320 dollars
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
of course the largest tax buy is the
 
05:16:38.150 --> 05:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
local school taxes and overburdened
 
05:16:41.570 --> 05:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
taxpayers frustrated and angry blame the
 
05:16:43.970 --> 05:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
schools and the school board and the
 
05:16:46.430 --> 05:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
teachers despite how hard everyone has
 
05:16:49.128 --> 05:16:49.138 align:start position:0%
worked to keep the expenses down
 
05:16:51.288 --> 05:16:51.298 align:start position:0%
this adversarial and often
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
confrontational situation harms the
 
05:16:57.230 --> 05:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
community pitting schools and parents
 
05:16:59.570 --> 05:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
with school-aged kids against other
 
05:17:03.530 --> 05:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
taxpayers many of whom are retirees on a
 
05:17:04.730 --> 05:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
fixed income
 
05:17:07.550 --> 05:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
there seems to be no relief and no end
 
05:17:11.208 --> 05:17:11.218 align:start position:0%
in sight this is unsustainable
 
05:17:14.330 --> 05:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
depending on where you look online the
 
05:17:16.850 --> 05:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
median household income in Hillsboro is
 
05:17:18.770 --> 05:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
somewhere between fifty five thousand
 
05:17:21.170 --> 05:17:21.180 align:start position:0%
and eighty thousand dollars a year
 
05:17:23.628 --> 05:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
assuming the true figure is somewhere in
 
05:17:26.208 --> 05:17:26.218 align:start position:0%
the middle it's obvious
 
05:17:28.610 --> 05:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
number of homeowners in town could see
 
05:17:31.490 --> 05:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
some real relief if this bill is signed
 
05:17:32.868 --> 05:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
into law
 
05:17:35.448 --> 05:17:35.458 align:start position:0%
from my constituents I hope the
 
05:17:39.288 --> 05:17:39.298 align:start position:0%
committee will look favorably on hb504
 
05:17:41.868 --> 05:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
while many tax cuts are being proposed
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
for businesses this year little is being
 
05:17:46.910 --> 05:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
done about the largest tax New Hampshire
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
residents pay the property tax
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
hb504 addresses that
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
at least until the state can come up
 
05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
with a more Equitable and Fair Way of
 
05:18:00.170 --> 05:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
funding our Public Schools it offers
 
05:18:02.628 --> 05:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
some hope for many including our
 
05:18:05.390 --> 05:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
hard-working families and those on fixed
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
incomes thank you
 
05:18:10.128 --> 05:18:10.138 align:start position:0%

05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
so the next would be a Jennifer boyiston
 
05:18:30.410 --> 05:18:30.420 align:start position:0%

05:19:28.970 --> 05:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
with my audio
 
05:19:31.490 --> 05:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so I have
 
05:19:33.410 --> 05:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
um just a quick comment that I'm pulling
 
05:19:34.368 --> 05:19:34.378 align:start position:0%
up here
 
05:19:36.890 --> 05:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
and I want to say thank you
 
05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh for giving me the opportunity to um
 
05:19:41.390 --> 05:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
talk with you today
 
05:19:45.050 --> 05:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
and why can't I there we go sorry all
 
05:19:47.690 --> 05:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
right I think I'm yeah and I'm I want to
 
05:19:50.208 --> 05:19:50.218 align:start position:0%
testify in support of this bill
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
um and I'll start by saying that I live
 
05:19:54.110 --> 05:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
in a small town in the Upper Valley
 
05:19:57.050 --> 05:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
um which is called lime New Hampshire
 
05:19:59.570 --> 05:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
um many people in our town uh recognize
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
the importance of public education and
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
they want to support our schools but
 
05:20:05.690 --> 05:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
like most communities in New Hampshire
 
05:20:07.788 --> 05:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
we have residents with a diversity of
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
incomes some of these incomes are very
 
05:20:12.770 --> 05:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
high some of them are moderate and
 
05:20:15.530 --> 05:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
others are low many of our residents are
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
retired and they live on fixed incomes
 
05:20:21.170 --> 05:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
uh many of those retired members of our
 
05:20:23.030 --> 05:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
community particularly live in a town
 
05:20:24.650 --> 05:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
whose demographics have shifted
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
dramatically over the past two decades
 
05:20:29.150 --> 05:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
and they may live in houses that are
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
currently assessed at values that they
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
would not have easily afforded when they
 
05:20:34.970 --> 05:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
worked and earned income
 
05:20:37.250 --> 05:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
as we build our budget as we build our
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
budgets for Town and school these
 
05:20:41.150 --> 05:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
vulnerable residents are at the
 
05:20:43.550 --> 05:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
Forefront of everyone's mind and we
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
struggle with a constantly increasing
 
05:20:47.570 --> 05:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
costs of Education we make many
 
05:20:50.030 --> 05:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
compromises particularly on Municipal
 
05:20:53.330 --> 05:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
spending to manage costs and all of this
 
05:20:55.250 --> 05:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
is done with the aim of protecting our
 
05:20:56.990 --> 05:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable residents
 
05:20:59.628 --> 05:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
I I see this bill is imparting some
 
05:21:01.730 --> 05:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
fairness to what I will admit I believe
 
05:21:04.250 --> 05:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
is a fundamentally unjust system of
 
05:21:07.070 --> 05:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
Taxation this isn't a cure-all but it
 
05:21:08.990 --> 05:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
does attempt to address a serious
 
05:21:11.628 --> 05:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
conflict and moreover as a previous
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative I think noted it does
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
address a common worry expressed by
 
05:21:19.610 --> 05:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
so-called donor towns donor towns worry
 
05:21:21.708 --> 05:21:21.718 align:start position:0%
about the ability of their retired and
 
05:21:23.510 --> 05:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
low-income residents to be able to
 
05:21:25.368 --> 05:21:25.378 align:start position:0%
afford their taxes
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
many towns across New Hampshire worry
 
05:21:30.170 --> 05:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
about the same thing but we have to do
 
05:21:31.850 --> 05:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
it without the help of state
 
05:21:34.910 --> 05:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
subsidization of costs and I hope that
 
05:21:37.550 --> 05:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
you'll keep that in mind as you consider
 
05:21:40.610 --> 05:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
um the acceptance of this bill and thank
 
05:21:44.990 --> 05:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:47.690 --> 05:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:21:50.570 --> 05:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
um Mr loyalist and any questions from
 
05:21:54.230 --> 05:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:56.448 --> 05:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee saying
 
05:21:58.430 --> 05:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much
 
05:22:01.690 --> 05:22:01.700 align:start position:0%
the next is from
 
05:22:06.490 --> 05:22:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:08.770 --> 05:22:08.780 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
05:22:12.890 --> 05:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh in opposition and he signed up for
 
05:22:15.288 --> 05:22:15.298 align:start position:0%
three minutes
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative mkitchen
 
05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:23.150 --> 05:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
05:22:27.050 --> 05:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
yes thank you honorable chair and
 
05:22:29.390 --> 05:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
Diego McCarron and I come before you to
 
05:22:34.670 --> 05:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
speak against House Bill 504 as
 
05:22:34.680 --> 05:22:36.190 align:start position:0%
speak against House Bill 504 as
presented

05:22:36.190 --> 05:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
presented
 
05:22:38.990 --> 05:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
as many of
 
05:22:41.990 --> 05:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
have mentioned I don't wish to return to
 
05:22:44.510 --> 05:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
the donor Town language of the past but
 
05:22:47.628 --> 05:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill proposes to do I
 
05:22:49.850 --> 05:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
was 715 New Hampshire Community sued the
 
05:22:51.890 --> 05:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
state arguing that the education funding
 
05:22:54.650 --> 05:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
system was unconstitutional 30 years
 
05:22:56.690 --> 05:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
later I agree with the Supreme Court
 
05:22:58.970 --> 05:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
that for the purposes of providing an
 
05:23:00.770 --> 05:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
adequate education New Hampshire is one
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
Community I believe that every child in
 
05:23:04.368 --> 05:23:04.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should get the same
 
05:23:05.990 --> 05:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities as I will strive to give
 
05:23:08.390 --> 05:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
my two daughters I believe so strongly
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
because if it were not for my own
 
05:23:12.170 --> 05:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
education and that of my parents I
 
05:23:13.610 --> 05:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be sitting here in front of you
 
05:23:13.620 --> 05:23:14.690 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be sitting here in front of you
today

05:23:14.690 --> 05:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:23:16.730 --> 05:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
I speak today as more than a dad who
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
believes in education I'm a counselor
 
05:23:20.510 --> 05:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
from the city of Portsmouth my hometown
 
05:23:22.430 --> 05:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
I live across the street from the house
 
05:23:24.230 --> 05:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
my dad grew up in and the one that my
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
grandfather built I didn't need to take
 
05:23:28.250 --> 05:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
my dad's word for it that Portsmouth has
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
changed you have likely seen it for
 
05:23:32.208 --> 05:23:32.218 align:start position:0%
yourself you might look at the rooms and
 
05:23:33.770 --> 05:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
meals revenue and wonder if there's a
 
05:23:36.170 --> 05:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
home cook among us but equally foolish
 
05:23:37.610 --> 05:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
is to look at her assessed value and
 
05:23:39.410 --> 05:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
believe a majority of folks could afford
 
05:23:41.570 --> 05:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
to buy their homes at that price I
 
05:23:43.010 --> 05:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
certainly couldn't I've only owned my
 
05:23:44.628 --> 05:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
home for six years
 
05:23:46.670 --> 05:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
my time on the council has shown me that
 
05:23:47.930 --> 05:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
there are many struggling under their
 
05:23:49.910 --> 05:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
property tax and we support the
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
provisions of tax relief but not how
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
this bill chooses to fund them a return
 
05:23:56.330 --> 05:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
to a donor Town education funding model
 
05:23:57.890 --> 05:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
through swept notwithstanding some of
 
05:23:59.868 --> 05:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
the modest increase in deductions could
 
05:24:01.490 --> 05:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
drive residents from ours and other
 
05:24:03.470 --> 05:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
similarly situated communities
 
05:24:05.628 --> 05:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
in any municipal election you speak to a
 
05:24:07.610 --> 05:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
lot of people I love meeting new people
 
05:24:09.230 --> 05:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
and hearing their stories but I hate
 
05:24:11.090 --> 05:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
hearing a familiar refrain of neighbors
 
05:24:12.830 --> 05:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
that don't know what to do because of
 
05:24:14.810 --> 05:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
the property tax you know you're when a
 
05:24:16.128 --> 05:24:16.138 align:start position:0%
budget might go up one to two percent
 
05:24:17.570 --> 05:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
because of downshifting estate
 
05:24:20.150 --> 05:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities some tax bills will go
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
up 20 to 30 percent why valuations you
 
05:24:25.250 --> 05:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
might point out Diego and increased
 
05:24:27.288 --> 05:24:27.298 align:start position:0%
valuations mean lower tax rate the whole
 
05:24:28.550 --> 05:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
reason you're here is that Portsmouth
 
05:24:29.990 --> 05:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
has a lower tax rate than another
 
05:24:32.570 --> 05:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
community that type of logic is halfway
 
05:24:34.550 --> 05:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
there if you look at the rate and not
 
05:24:36.170 --> 05:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
the valuation you miss what is driving
 
05:24:38.750 --> 05:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
the pain because of comparable wholesale
 
05:24:41.208 --> 05:24:41.218 align:start position:0%
home sale appraisal method your tax rate
 
05:24:43.970 --> 05:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
can and often will fall in property-rich
 
05:24:46.250 --> 05:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
areas only to see your taxes rise when
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
similar homes sell the similar appraisal
 
05:24:51.170 --> 05:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
method required by the state in order to
 
05:24:53.150 --> 05:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
fill our assessment duties means that
 
05:24:55.550 --> 05:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
when a home in a neighborhood sells at
 
05:24:57.170 --> 05:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
an increased value will cause other
 
05:24:59.330 --> 05:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
houses to be assessed at higher values
 
05:25:01.730 --> 05:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
which results in higher taxes creating a
 
05:25:03.770 --> 05:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
vicious circle having a replace
 
05:25:05.570 --> 05:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
education funding sent to the state
 
05:25:07.788 --> 05:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
through the reinstatement of the donor
 
05:25:09.770 --> 05:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
Town education funding model will only
 
05:25:11.868 --> 05:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
accelerate this cycle many in these
 
05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
communities will be forced to leave and
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
by their leaving will lose a piece of
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
our history
 
05:25:17.990 --> 05:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
there are few that understand this last
 
05:25:19.490 --> 05:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
point and still shrug their shoulders
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to cry for someone's
 
05:25:23.570 --> 05:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
house increasing in value I hear that a
 
05:25:25.368 --> 05:25:25.378 align:start position:0%
lot as if houses weren't places to raise
 
05:25:27.170 --> 05:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
our families but investment vehicles
 
05:25:29.030 --> 05:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
flip frequently in search of ever
 
05:25:31.250 --> 05:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
increasing gains our communities are
 
05:25:33.050 --> 05:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
places to rely on one another forming
 
05:25:34.970 --> 05:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
bonds and friendships people we can
 
05:25:36.650 --> 05:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
count on in a snowstorm when our forward
 
05:25:39.050 --> 05:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
dies not just containers for investment
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
since everyone will sell in four to six
 
05:25:43.010 --> 05:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
years once they maximize their profit
 
05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
and are ready to bring their house to
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
the market like a farmer brings their
 
05:25:47.868 --> 05:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
corn call me old-fashioned but I want
 
05:25:49.250 --> 05:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
more than that in a house and a
 
05:25:51.170 --> 05:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
community we're petulating a broken
 
05:25:52.910 --> 05:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
system that will one day break for
 
05:25:54.948 --> 05:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
everyone will first destroy communities
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
like Portsmouth I grew up here I stayed
 
05:25:59.628 --> 05:25:59.638 align:start position:0%

05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
history and the people that make up each
 
05:26:07.730 --> 05:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
donor town community if you believe like
 
05:26:09.830 --> 05:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
I do the strength of a tree is not just
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
the new weeds and branches sprouting
 
05:26:13.368 --> 05:26:13.378 align:start position:0%
looking for sunlight but also the roots
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%

public education
 
05:28:29.690 --> 05:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
I've been serving as an active member on
 
05:28:30.948 --> 05:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school funding
 
05:28:33.610 --> 05:28:33.620 align:start position:0%
commission as well during this past year
 
05:28:36.288 --> 05:28:36.298 align:start position:0%
my primary career was served for the
 
05:28:38.090 --> 05:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
city of Berlin where there is an obvious
 
05:28:41.208 --> 05:28:41.218 align:start position:0%
and clear lack of economic tax base to
 
05:28:42.650 --> 05:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
supplement revenues from the local
 
05:28:46.010 --> 05:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers I know budgets well
 
05:28:47.930 --> 05:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
and have had to make decisions to
 
05:28:49.810 --> 05:28:49.820 align:start position:0%
eliminate programs teachers
 
05:28:52.730 --> 05:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
administrator positions and closed
 
05:28:55.368 --> 05:28:55.378 align:start position:0%
school buildings in order to prevent the
 
05:28:57.948 --> 05:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
city from Financial plight
 
05:29:00.470 --> 05:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
just to give you uh noted different from
 
05:29:02.390 --> 05:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
two communities that I am a property
 
05:29:06.470 --> 05:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
owner in in 2009 for 2019
 
05:29:09.430 --> 05:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
Berlin's overall property tax rate was
 
05:29:13.128 --> 05:29:13.138 align:start position:0%
32.28 per thousand of value on an
 
05:29:14.690 --> 05:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
equalized basis
 
05:29:16.490 --> 05:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
that includes a local and State
 
05:29:20.448 --> 05:29:20.458 align:start position:0%
education tax rate of 12.68
 
05:29:22.550 --> 05:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the town of Arrow the overall rate
 
05:29:26.288 --> 05:29:26.298 align:start position:0%
was 13.39 with a state
 
05:29:29.628 --> 05:29:29.638 align:start position:0%
with a total state and local education
 
05:29:34.128 --> 05:29:34.138 align:start position:0%
tax rate of just 5.86 needed to meet
 
05:29:36.230 --> 05:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
very similar public education
 
05:29:40.670 --> 05:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
requirements so legislators must work to
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
improve the equity of the New Hampshire
 
05:29:45.170 --> 05:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
property tax system by remitting the
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
revenues from the Statewide education
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
property tax to the state we must
 
05:29:52.190 --> 05:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
prevent the continuation of inequity of
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
funding our Public School Systems
 
05:29:57.170 --> 05:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
house members have the power to ensure
 
05:30:00.110 --> 05:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
the gap of student opportunities in our
 
05:30:03.110 --> 05:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
Public Schools is decreased rather than
 
05:30:05.690 --> 05:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
continue to be increased
 
05:30:07.850 --> 05:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire communities share the
 
05:30:10.670 --> 05:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
need for a well-educated Workforce and
 
05:30:12.410 --> 05:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
thus have the need for an equitable
 
05:30:14.270 --> 05:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
education system
 
05:30:17.390 --> 05:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 504 stands to enhance
 
05:30:19.368 --> 05:30:19.378 align:start position:0%
opportunities for property tax relief
 
05:30:21.890 --> 05:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
for low and moderate income homeowners
 
05:30:23.448 --> 05:30:23.458 align:start position:0%
in all communities
 
05:30:27.410 --> 05:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this film I'm sorry what
 
05:30:30.770 --> 05:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
no the sponsors of this bill know
 
05:30:32.690 --> 05:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
firsthand the need to change New
 
05:30:34.250 --> 05:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding from the
 
05:30:36.530 --> 05:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
dependents on local property taxpayers
 
05:30:39.410 --> 05:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
to a Statewide tax system to equitably
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
fund a New Hampshire adequate education
 
05:30:45.530 --> 05:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
this bill also requires revenue from the
 
05:30:47.690 --> 05:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax to be
 
05:30:50.990 --> 05:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
collected in a central manner via dra
 
05:30:53.030 --> 05:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
for redistribution to the communities
 
05:30:55.310 --> 05:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
who are in most need and who lack the
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
ability and resources to maintain their
 
05:30:59.448 --> 05:30:59.458 align:start position:0%
public school programs
 
05:31:01.310 --> 05:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
it is only a wish of North Country
 
05:31:02.930 --> 05:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
School students to have the
 
05:31:05.750 --> 05:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities and resources of other
 
05:31:08.810 --> 05:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
wealthier towns I urge a committee to
 
05:31:11.330 --> 05:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
vote in support of House Bill 504 as a
 
05:31:13.970 --> 05:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
first step process toward providing an
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
equitable Statewide Public School
 
05:31:18.650 --> 05:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
funding program that meets adequacy for
 
05:31:20.810 --> 05:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
all communities not just property
 
05:31:23.030 --> 05:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
wealthy ones and that increases
 
05:31:25.550 --> 05:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities for all students not just
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
some I recommend you all review the
 
05:31:29.810 --> 05:31:29.820 align:start position:0%

05:33:28.970 --> 05:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
and this bill does three things in my
 
05:33:31.610 --> 05:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
mind that are good and I don't think I
 
05:33:34.550 --> 05:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
need a minute to talk about each of them
 
05:33:37.490 --> 05:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
the first good thing that this bill does
 
05:33:40.430 --> 05:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps nobody has noticed nobody's
 
05:33:45.910 --> 05:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned it it amends RSA 76 section
 
05:33:50.930 --> 05:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
11a to increase the visibility on
 
05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
everyone's tax bill of the low the
 
05:33:59.030 --> 05:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
availability of tax relief programs such
 
05:34:01.570 --> 05:34:01.580 align:start position:0%
as low and moderate income but also
 
05:34:04.730 --> 05:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
abatement and deferral and the other
 
05:34:07.970 --> 05:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
programs that my clients would like to
 
05:34:10.730 --> 05:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
benefit from they can't benefit from
 
05:34:12.830 --> 05:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
those programs if they don't know they
 
05:34:15.590 --> 05:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
exist and
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
um making the notice more prominent by
 
05:34:23.350 --> 05:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
requiring it to be in bold 12 point type
 
05:34:28.430 --> 05:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
is very sorely needed and so that's one
 
05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
05:34:32.510 --> 05:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
the second good thing that this bill
 
05:34:35.868 --> 05:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
does is make the low and moderate income
 
05:34:39.470 --> 05:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program uh more
 
05:34:42.128 --> 05:34:42.138 align:start position:0%
generous and available to more people
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
and uh we are in favor of that as well
 
05:34:50.570 --> 05:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
and the third good thing that this bill
 
05:34:54.050 --> 05:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
does is the study committee
 
05:34:56.448 --> 05:34:56.458 align:start position:0%
um which addresses
 
05:34:59.690 --> 05:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
um how property taxes affect tenants
 
05:35:03.650 --> 05:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
which I think is wonderful and
 
05:35:05.570 --> 05:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
um not enough people have paid attention
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
to and also
 
05:35:11.030 --> 05:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
um to be covered in the study committee
 
05:35:15.590 --> 05:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
are the needs of people uh for deferral
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
of their property taxes so um I think
 
05:35:21.890 --> 05:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
that is a very
 
05:35:26.150 --> 05:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
um useful project so those are the good
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
things that uh we think this bill does
 
05:35:33.050 --> 05:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to take any
 
05:35:33.060 --> 05:35:35.628 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to take any
questions

05:35:35.628 --> 05:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
great and Mrs Bray for you testimony
 
05:35:41.390 --> 05:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
05:35:44.090 --> 05:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
two people with questions representative
 
05:35:44.100 --> 05:35:45.650 align:start position:0%

Army
 
05:35:49.190 --> 05:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be really quick on about
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
property tax deferrals I thought that
 
05:35:53.810 --> 05:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
that was just to try to figure out a way
 
05:35:56.570 --> 05:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
for the state to substitute for the
 
05:35:59.510 --> 05:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
local deferrals do you find that local
 
05:36:03.948 --> 05:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
deferrals are frequently not allowed
 
05:36:07.670 --> 05:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
I find that a lot of towns don't even
 
05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
know they're a thing
 
05:36:15.350 --> 05:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
I have had to educate a few quite a few
 
05:36:19.250 --> 05:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
towns that deferral is a thing
 
05:36:24.110 --> 05:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
um I also have to explain
 
05:36:25.610 --> 05:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
um what
 
05:36:28.250 --> 05:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
um disabled means for purposes of
 
05:36:31.250 --> 05:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
deferral and that deferral is available
 
05:36:35.150 --> 05:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
to disabled persons in addition to
 
05:36:37.430 --> 05:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
elderly persons
 
05:36:40.430 --> 05:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
um so I hope that answers your question
 
05:36:41.850 --> 05:36:41.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:36:41.860 --> 05:36:45.230 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

05:37:10.368 --> 05:37:10.378 align:start position:0%
yes wonderful well chairman major
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
representative Almy and members of the
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee thank you so much for the
 
05:37:15.650 --> 05:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify before you this
 
05:37:17.628 --> 05:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon for the record my name is Jeff
 
05:37:20.330 --> 05:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
mclinch and I am indeed a lobbyist but
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
my sole client so to speak is the New
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding fairness
 
05:37:26.750 --> 05:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
project where I am the Project Director
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
as houseville 504 would make New
 
05:37:30.410 --> 05:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's tax system significantly
 
05:37:31.430 --> 05:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
more fair
 
05:37:32.810 --> 05:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school funding
 
05:37:34.550 --> 05:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
fairness project strongly supports the
 
05:37:36.288 --> 05:37:36.298 align:start position:0%
bill and urges the committee to
 
05:37:38.090 --> 05:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
recommend it as ought to pass
 
05:37:39.530 --> 05:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
as members of this committee are
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
uniquely aware you can't talk about New
 
05:37:43.310 --> 05:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's tax system without talking
 
05:37:45.650 --> 05:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
about the property tax it's far and away
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
the largest tax collected in New
 
05:37:49.310 --> 05:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire generating close to four
 
05:37:50.930 --> 05:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
billion dollars to support state local
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
public services in 2019 well in excess
 
05:37:55.910 --> 05:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
of any other form of Taxation levied in
 
05:37:56.930 --> 05:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:37:58.850 --> 05:37:58.860 align:start position:0%
yet the property tax is also an unfair
 
05:38:00.948 --> 05:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
tax as it places far greater
 
05:38:02.330 --> 05:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
responsibility on low and moderate
 
05:38:04.368 --> 05:38:04.378 align:start position:0%
income taxpayers than it does on more
 
05:38:06.708 --> 05:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
affluent ones according to data from The
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%

the poorest fifth of New Hampshire
 
05:38:13.250 --> 05:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
households paid 6.2 percent of their
 
05:38:16.128 --> 05:38:16.138 align:start position:0%
incomes and property taxes in 2018. in
 
05:38:18.350 --> 05:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
contrast the wealthiest one percent Each
 
05:38:20.208 --> 05:38:20.218 align:start position:0%
of which enjoyed an income in excess of
 
05:38:22.550 --> 05:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
over five hundred thousand dollars paid
 
05:38:24.350 --> 05:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
an effective property tax rate of under
 
05:38:26.030 --> 05:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
two percent
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
now despite its heavy Reliance on the
 
05:38:29.990 --> 05:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
property tax and in turn that tax is
 
05:38:32.330 --> 05:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
heavy tall and the least well off New
 
05:38:33.590 --> 05:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does precious little to
 
05:38:35.750 --> 05:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
mitigate the impact of the tax on those
 
05:38:38.090 --> 05:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
struggling to make ends meet
 
05:38:39.590 --> 05:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I think you all talked a little bit
 
05:38:40.970 --> 05:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
today about the existing low and
 
05:38:42.830 --> 05:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
moderate income property tax relief
 
05:38:42.840 --> 05:38:43.730 align:start position:0%
moderate income property tax relief
program

05:38:43.730 --> 05:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
sadly that program has all been
 
05:38:48.830 --> 05:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
evaporated in recent years in 2003 it
 
05:38:50.868 --> 05:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
had provided roughly seven and a half
 
05:38:53.628 --> 05:38:53.638 align:start position:0%
million dollars in relief to over 27 000
 
05:38:56.930 --> 05:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
Granite State households by 2018 those
 
05:38:58.850 --> 05:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
figures have dwindled to fewer than 7
 
05:39:01.190 --> 05:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
000 households receiving a total of just
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
1.1 million dollars in rebates even as
 
05:39:06.410 --> 05:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
property taxes continue to climb
 
05:39:08.270 --> 05:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
the bill before you this afternoon would
 
05:39:10.070 --> 05:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
change that and change it dramatically
 
05:39:13.550 --> 05:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
if enacted into law House Bill 504 would
 
05:39:14.990 --> 05:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
significantly increase both the number
 
05:39:16.670 --> 05:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
of homeowners eligible to receive relief
 
05:39:18.830 --> 05:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
and the value of the rebates they would
 
05:39:20.750 --> 05:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
receive I believe representative Ames
 
05:39:22.250 --> 05:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
has already reviewed the change in the
 
05:39:23.390 --> 05:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
various parameters so I don't want to
 
05:39:25.190 --> 05:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
belabor that point but I do want to
 
05:39:28.010 --> 05:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
emphasize that this bill would extend
 
05:39:29.448 --> 05:39:29.458 align:start position:0%
or would change the programs that
 
05:39:30.890 --> 05:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
applied not just to the Statewide
 
05:39:32.150 --> 05:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
05:39:34.128 --> 05:39:34.138 align:start position:0%
but to local school property taxes as
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
well and just to offer an example of
 
05:39:37.368 --> 05:39:37.378 align:start position:0%
what that might mean for New Hampshire
 
05:39:39.830 --> 05:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
family let's take a married couple
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
living in Charlestown
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
for the sake of this example let's
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
assume the couple has an income of about
 
05:39:46.490 --> 05:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
forty five thousand dollars and lives in
 
05:39:47.868 --> 05:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
a home worth a hundred fifty thousand
 
05:39:47.878 --> 05:39:49.368 align:start position:0%
a home worth a hundred fifty thousand
dollars

05:39:49.368 --> 05:39:49.378 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:39:52.250 --> 05:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
um in 2019 on an equalized basis the
 
05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
local school property tax rate that they
 
05:39:56.270 --> 05:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
paid was just over twenty dollars per
 
05:39:59.810 --> 05:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
thousand the Statewide rate was 1.76 so
 
05:40:01.368 --> 05:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
their property tax bills strictly for
 
05:40:03.288 --> 05:40:03.298 align:start position:0%
schools purposes was about thirty three
 
05:40:04.670 --> 05:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
05:40:06.410 --> 05:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
their overall bill is probably closer to
 
05:40:08.628 --> 05:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars or more than ten
 
05:40:10.368 --> 05:40:10.378 align:start position:0%
percent of their total income
 
05:40:12.170 --> 05:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
under current law they would not receive
 
05:40:13.730 --> 05:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
any relief whatsoever because their
 
05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
income was too high and even if their
 
05:40:17.930 --> 05:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
income were sufficiently low the maximum
 
05:40:19.010 --> 05:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
amount of relief they would receive
 
05:40:21.410 --> 05:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
would be no more than about 180 dollars
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
if House Bill 504 became law they would
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
receive a rebate of one thousand dollars
 
05:40:27.948 --> 05:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars that they could use
 
05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
at local businesses to put food on their
 
05:40:32.390 --> 05:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
table eat in their home and gas in their
 
05:40:32.400 --> 05:40:33.230 align:start position:0%
table eat in their home and gas in their
car

05:40:33.230 --> 05:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
car
 
05:40:33.240 --> 05:40:34.550 align:start position:0%
car
now

05:40:34.550 --> 05:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:40:35.690 --> 05:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
um this is one other aspect of the bill
 
05:40:36.830 --> 05:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
has already been discussed so I don't
 
05:40:38.448 --> 05:40:38.458 align:start position:0%
want to labor too much
 
05:40:40.788 --> 05:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
but uh Hospital 504 does advance
 
05:40:42.530 --> 05:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
taxpayer equity in one other critical
 
05:40:44.690 --> 05:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
way as it would end the preferential
 
05:40:44.700 --> 05:40:45.650 align:start position:0%
way as it would end the preferential
treatment

05:40:45.650 --> 05:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:40:47.090 --> 05:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
that some property wealthy
 
05:40:49.310 --> 05:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities now enjoy under the
 
05:40:51.410 --> 05:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax
 
05:40:53.690 --> 05:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
um many of you have heard before but in
 
05:40:56.090 --> 05:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
Claremont 2 the Supreme Court ruled that
 
05:40:58.128 --> 05:40:58.138 align:start position:0%
to the extent a property tax is used to
 
05:41:00.410 --> 05:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
fund an adequate education the tax must
 
05:41:02.090 --> 05:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
be administered in a way that's uniform
 
05:41:04.128 --> 05:41:04.138 align:start position:0%
and rate throughout the state in its
 
05:41:05.570 --> 05:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
current form the swept is far from
 
05:41:07.250 --> 05:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
uniform cities and towns with
 
05:41:08.990 --> 05:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
comparatively High property wealth are
 
05:41:10.970 --> 05:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
permitted to retain any revenue from the
 
05:41:13.128 --> 05:41:13.138 align:start position:0%
tax over and above what's needed to meet
 
05:41:15.530 --> 05:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
the cost of an adequate education as a
 
05:41:17.170 --> 05:41:17.180 align:start position:0%
result the swept in its present form
 
05:41:19.250 --> 05:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
exacerbates the wide disparities in
 
05:41:21.410 --> 05:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
school property tax rates that now exist
 
05:41:22.670 --> 05:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire
 
05:41:24.530 --> 05:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
by restoring that swept as a true
 
05:41:27.410 --> 05:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide tax House Bill 504 promotes
 
05:41:28.910 --> 05:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
not only greater Equity but fiscal
 
05:41:30.948 --> 05:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility too as the revenue
 
05:41:32.510 --> 05:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
returning from this to the state from
 
05:41:34.430 --> 05:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
swept would be used to offset the cost
 
05:41:36.470 --> 05:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
of the additional rebates associated
 
05:41:38.050 --> 05:41:38.060 align:start position:0%
with the property tax relief Provisions
 
05:41:40.788 --> 05:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
those costs to be further limited by
 
05:41:42.890 --> 05:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
capping individual rebates at no more
 
05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
than a thousand dollars
 
05:41:46.670 --> 05:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh as I conclude I just would like to
 
05:41:48.650 --> 05:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
note that this committee has already
 
05:41:50.330 --> 05:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
heard extensive testimony this session
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
about numerous changes in tax law to
 
05:41:54.830 --> 05:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
Spur economic growth and to ease the
 
05:41:56.270 --> 05:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
financial hardships arising from the
 
05:41:58.430 --> 05:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic any effort to use New
 
05:41:59.810 --> 05:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's tax system to achieve those
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
ends should start with House Bill 504 it
 
05:42:04.190 --> 05:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
would put hundreds of dollars in the
 
05:42:06.288 --> 05:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
pockets of Grant Staters still coping
 
05:42:07.730 --> 05:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
with The Economic Consequences of the
 
05:42:09.770 --> 05:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
pandemic and allow them to shop and
 
05:42:11.390 --> 05:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
spend at local businesses striving to
 
05:42:12.650 --> 05:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
remain open
 
05:42:14.330 --> 05:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
for these reasons that once again urged
 
05:42:15.410 --> 05:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
the committee to recommend House Bill
 
05:42:17.868 --> 05:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
504 is off to pass and I look forward to
 
05:42:19.128 --> 05:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
working with all of you if there should
 
05:42:21.470 --> 05:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
be worse sex work sessions and I'd be
 
05:42:22.550 --> 05:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
 
05:42:22.560 --> 05:42:23.628 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
have

05:42:23.628 --> 05:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:42:26.150 --> 05:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony Mr mcloanch
 
05:42:27.948 --> 05:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
questions from
 
05:42:31.910 --> 05:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
the committee representative thank you
 
05:42:33.770 --> 05:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you Mr Mick Lynch for
 
05:42:35.868 --> 05:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
your testimony going back to law and
 
05:42:37.550 --> 05:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
moderate income homeowners property tax
 
05:42:41.810 --> 05:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
relief which is under RSA 198 colon 57.
 
05:42:44.150 --> 05:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
now that statute hasn't changed over the
 
05:42:46.850 --> 05:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
years is that correct and so if that's
 
05:42:47.990 --> 05:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
the case
 
05:42:50.868 --> 05:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
then why is it that that the number of
 
05:42:53.690 --> 05:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
people availing themselves to this is
 
05:42:53.700 --> 05:42:55.310 align:start position:0%
people availing themselves to this is
occurring

05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
05:42:57.410 --> 05:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
so uh you're correct that
 
05:43:00.410 --> 05:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
um in some respects it's not changed and
 
05:43:02.690 --> 05:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
most notably the income thresholds that
 
05:43:05.810 --> 05:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
you see uh in the bill have not changed
 
05:43:09.110 --> 05:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
in those 15 years so um they've not kept
 
05:43:10.970 --> 05:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
pace with inflation
 
05:43:12.410 --> 05:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
um so naturally you would expect that
 
05:43:14.090 --> 05:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
some people would become ineligible over
 
05:43:16.910 --> 05:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
time the biggest consequence though is
 
05:43:18.890 --> 05:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
changes in the Statewide property tax
 
05:43:20.810 --> 05:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
itself as I believe was mentioned
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
earlier that tax used to be levied at
 
05:43:26.628 --> 05:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
6.66 six dollars and sixty cents per
 
05:43:28.490 --> 05:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
thousand which meant that it provided
 
05:43:30.170 --> 05:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
greater relief relief and greater
 
05:43:32.510 --> 05:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
incentive to folks to take part
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
um because of changes to bring that rate
 
05:43:36.948 --> 05:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
down to under two dollars it no longer
 
05:43:38.510 --> 05:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
delivers the same amount of relief that
 
05:43:40.070 --> 05:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
it once did
 
05:43:41.590 --> 05:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:45.410 --> 05:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:48.530 --> 05:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:43:51.590 --> 05:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh Mr mcwench
 
05:43:53.570 --> 05:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I understand the nature of the
 
05:43:56.690 --> 05:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
problem you're describing and I would
 
05:43:59.750 --> 05:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
Echo that you've chosen Charlestown
 
05:44:02.750 --> 05:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
as a prime example that's the town I
 
05:44:02.760 --> 05:44:04.970 align:start position:0%
as a prime example that's the town I
represent

05:44:04.970 --> 05:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:44:08.810 --> 05:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
what I'm failing to see in this bill or
 
05:44:11.390 --> 05:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
understand in the testimony
 
05:44:14.510 --> 05:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
is how this would help to mitigate
 
05:44:16.730 --> 05:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
the real estate property tax grade in
 
05:44:16.740 --> 05:44:17.750 align:start position:0%
the real estate property tax grade in
Charleston

05:44:17.750 --> 05:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
Charleston
 
05:44:21.350 --> 05:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
you used a figure of a little over 24.
 
05:44:23.030 --> 05:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
just to update
 
05:44:25.368 --> 05:44:25.378 align:start position:0%
the budget that will be on our ballot
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
March 9th
 
05:44:30.110 --> 05:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
will result in a local at a rate of
 
05:44:30.120 --> 05:44:32.390 align:start position:0%
will result in a local at a rate of
27.55

05:44:32.390 --> 05:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
27.55
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
and when you combine that with the
 
05:44:34.200 --> 05:44:35.628 align:start position:0%
and when you combine that with the
squept

05:44:35.628 --> 05:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
squept
 
05:44:38.510 --> 05:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
we're bumping right up against 30.
 
05:44:40.310 --> 05:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything in this bill that
 
05:44:43.128 --> 05:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
mitigates the overall burden on the
 
05:44:45.708 --> 05:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
community which affects absolutely
 
05:44:48.470 --> 05:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
everything in the community including
 
05:44:50.628 --> 05:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
its desirability for anyone who to move
 
05:44:54.410 --> 05:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
in open a business expand the business
 
05:44:54.420 --> 05:44:55.750 align:start position:0%
in open a business expand the business
mistakes

05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
05:44:58.910 --> 05:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
so where do we go
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
if the problems for property poor
 
05:45:04.788 --> 05:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
communities is the effect of the rate on
 
05:45:06.890 --> 05:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
the entire community
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for that question
 
05:45:08.520 --> 05:45:09.890 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for that question
representative

05:45:09.890 --> 05:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would respond with a couple
 
05:45:14.690 --> 05:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
of thoughts uh the first is that with
 
05:45:16.490 --> 05:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
the property tax relief Provisions that
 
05:45:17.868 --> 05:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
are in this bill
 
05:45:19.970 --> 05:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
the effective rate to folks in
 
05:45:22.010 --> 05:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
Charlestown will pay or at least the
 
05:45:23.390 --> 05:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
effective rate for low and moderate
 
05:45:25.070 --> 05:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
income folks in Charlestown were paying
 
05:45:27.948 --> 05:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
would draw so that while the rate on
 
05:45:29.690 --> 05:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
their bill might be the same as as you
 
05:45:32.150 --> 05:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
just described they would be receiving a
 
05:45:34.128 --> 05:45:34.138 align:start position:0%
check of up to a thousand dollars to
 
05:45:35.990 --> 05:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
help offset those costs
 
05:45:38.030 --> 05:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
the second thing I would mention is that
 
05:45:40.368 --> 05:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
if depending on sort of the particulars
 
05:45:42.048 --> 05:45:42.058 align:start position:0%
of how many people take up the property
 
05:45:44.868 --> 05:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
tax release option
 
05:45:47.510 --> 05:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would generate additional
 
05:45:49.910 --> 05:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
funds to the to the order of 25 to 30
 
05:45:52.368 --> 05:45:52.378 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually from restoring
 
05:45:52.378 --> 05:45:53.208 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually from restoring
yourself

05:45:53.208 --> 05:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
funds that would then be available to be
 
05:45:57.170 --> 05:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
redistributed in the way that they're
 
05:45:59.330 --> 05:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
not now to cities and towns they're
 
05:46:02.150 --> 05:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
really struggling to fund schools in an
 
05:46:04.430 --> 05:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
adequate way and then the third point I
 
05:46:06.410 --> 05:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
would offer is that um
 
05:46:10.430 --> 05:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
the two um Chief ideas in this bill are
 
05:46:12.890 --> 05:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
grounded in the work of the commission
 
05:46:14.750 --> 05:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
that representative Ames and
 
05:46:16.548 --> 05:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
representative Bluebell and Mr hardinger
 
05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
all served upon and that the work of
 
05:46:22.368 --> 05:46:22.378 align:start position:0%
that commission was extensive and
 
05:46:25.850 --> 05:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
extended Beyond to address issues with
 
05:46:27.470 --> 05:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
school funding to make it more Equitable
 
05:46:29.330 --> 05:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
and I believe there's other legislation
 
05:46:31.548 --> 05:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
now being considered
 
05:46:33.590 --> 05:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
um in the senate in particular that
 
05:46:36.470 --> 05:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
would act upon those recommendations in
 
05:46:39.170 --> 05:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony today
 
05:46:40.610 --> 05:46:40.620 align:start position:0%
um you know I was reflecting upon the
 
05:46:42.530 --> 05:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
nature of some questions about
 
05:46:44.570 --> 05:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
um donor towns or towns that receive
 
05:46:47.628 --> 05:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
property tax abatements that debate is
 
05:46:49.190 --> 05:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
in large measure a function of the fact
 
05:46:52.788 --> 05:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
that um School prop excuse me State
 
05:46:55.430 --> 05:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
education Aid is woefully inadequate it
 
05:46:57.170 --> 05:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
does not meet the full responsibility of
 
05:46:59.930 --> 05:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
the state if State education Aid were
 
05:47:01.730 --> 05:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
came closer to the actual cost that
 
05:47:04.250 --> 05:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
Satan towns incurred in serving their
 
05:47:05.810 --> 05:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
children we would not be having this
 
05:47:07.070 --> 05:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
conversation at all about donor
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
attendance because that Aid would be
 
05:47:10.250 --> 05:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
significantly more than what is
 
05:47:12.048 --> 05:47:12.058 align:start position:0%
generated through the state property tax
 
05:47:28.810 --> 05:47:28.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:32.628 --> 05:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:34.670 --> 05:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
bringing them in
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair and Paul as are
 
05:47:42.110 --> 05:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
you testifying for or against and how
 
05:47:42.120 --> 05:47:47.510 align:start position:0%
you testifying for or against and how
long

05:47:47.510 --> 05:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:51.350 --> 05:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:53.208 --> 05:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
05:47:56.510 --> 05:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
Paul sometimes are we there again are
 
05:47:59.090 --> 05:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
you testifying for or against the bill
 
05:48:02.208 --> 05:48:02.218 align:start position:0%
and how long do you plan I'll be very
 
05:48:03.948 --> 05:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
short probably under two minutes and I'm
 
05:48:06.410 --> 05:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
in opposition
 
05:48:08.810 --> 05:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
um Logistics didn't prevent prevented me
 
05:48:11.330 --> 05:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
from logging on earlier and noting that
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for that but I thank you
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to join the group uh
 
05:48:17.868 --> 05:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
this afternoon I represent or work for
 
05:48:20.330 --> 05:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
the town of Newington and I'm providing
 
05:48:23.750 --> 05:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh their opposition to the proposed uh
 
05:48:27.288 --> 05:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
House Bill 504 and I will have written
 
05:48:30.770 --> 05:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
commentary shortly to the uh staff to
 
05:48:33.288 --> 05:48:33.298 align:start position:0%
circulate amongst you uh after uh the
 
05:48:37.070 --> 05:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh session but to summarize uh
 
05:48:39.708 --> 05:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
we applaud in town Newington that this
 
05:48:41.990 --> 05:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
issue is being addressed the low and
 
05:48:45.288 --> 05:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
moderate uh income house uh homeowner
 
05:48:47.750 --> 05:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program uh has been
 
05:48:50.570 --> 05:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
neglected for any number of years uh
 
05:48:54.170 --> 05:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
however when the funding mechanism that
 
05:48:57.770 --> 05:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
is envisioned here of providing the 25
 
05:49:01.010 --> 05:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars in relief money comes
 
05:49:04.190 --> 05:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
from only 46 communities uh in the state
 
05:49:06.830 --> 05:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
who are going to end up turning over
 
05:49:09.948 --> 05:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
approximately 28 million dollars over to
 
05:49:11.810 --> 05:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
the state that's something that we don't
 
05:49:13.970 --> 05:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
think is appropriate and is again
 
05:49:15.770 --> 05:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
resumption of the donor and receiver
 
05:49:18.350 --> 05:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
Town concept which the town of Newington
 
05:49:22.670 --> 05:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
and others are uh opposed to now uh I
 
05:49:24.948 --> 05:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
also object somewhat to the description
 
05:49:28.368 --> 05:49:28.378 align:start position:0%
of these wealthy towns and versus poorer
 
05:49:30.650 --> 05:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
towns I'll use an example if we're known
 
05:49:33.470 --> 05:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
can itself yes it appears because of the
 
05:49:35.270 --> 05:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
amount of the industry and Commercial
 
05:49:38.030 --> 05:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
development of the town has
 
05:49:40.250 --> 05:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
um then perhaps it has resources that
 
05:49:42.530 --> 05:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
other towns don't but in terms of this
 
05:49:43.730 --> 05:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
05:49:46.310 --> 05:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
I would like to point out of the 1.2
 
05:49:47.930 --> 05:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
billion dollars worth of assessed value
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
nearly half of it is utility property
 
05:49:54.470 --> 05:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
so only half of our tax base is going to
 
05:49:56.570 --> 05:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
be able to contribute under this bill
 
05:50:00.708 --> 05:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
towards our obligation uh envisioned and
 
05:50:03.048 --> 05:50:03.058 align:start position:0%
that would be approximately uh eight
 
05:50:05.090 --> 05:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifteen thousand dollars
 
05:50:08.090 --> 05:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's 815 000 that is currently going
 
05:50:10.190 --> 05:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
to support our children's education but
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
will have to be turned over to the state
 
05:50:16.368 --> 05:50:16.378 align:start position:0%
and then re raise again locally in order
 
05:50:18.530 --> 05:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
to make up that deficit
 
05:50:21.288 --> 05:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
um so the impact to Residents uh here in
 
05:50:23.150 --> 05:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
Newington is going to be significant
 
05:50:26.868 --> 05:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
because of that proportional uh value of
 
05:50:30.590 --> 05:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
of non-utility values uh is going to
 
05:50:31.970 --> 05:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
have to be the tax base that's going to
 
05:50:33.708 --> 05:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
support that the other thing that's
 
05:50:35.330 --> 05:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunate the bill doesn't address is
 
05:50:37.910 --> 05:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
is that it doesn't address a local uh
 
05:50:39.890 --> 05:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
property tax relief in general it only
 
05:50:43.128 --> 05:50:43.138 align:start position:0%
speaks to the state uh wide education
 
05:50:46.910 --> 05:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
property tax uh so I think uh we all
 
05:50:49.970 --> 05:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
agree that high property tax uh burdens
 
05:50:52.730 --> 05:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
are uh are are significant to all
 
05:50:55.970 --> 05:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
taxpayers regardless of their Source be
 
05:50:58.670 --> 05:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
it a Statewide the local or education or
 
05:51:01.430 --> 05:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
even the county so there's a there's a
 
05:51:04.010 --> 05:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
disparity or our missing piece of tax
 
05:51:05.990 --> 05:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
relief for these tax there's this
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
envisioned because it's only addressing
 
05:51:12.350 --> 05:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
um lastly uh in a more personal
 
05:51:14.638 --> 05:51:16.430 align:start position:0%
um lastly uh in a more personal
observation

05:51:16.430 --> 05:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
observation
 
05:51:18.530 --> 05:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
um I would like to note that that
 
05:51:20.330 --> 05:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
perhaps is a technical deficiency with
 
05:51:22.548 --> 05:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
the bill under session one where it
 
05:51:26.208 --> 05:51:26.218 align:start position:0%
speaks to uh uh turning over the excess
 
05:51:28.310 --> 05:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
swept to the Department of Revenue
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
Administration it speaks to subtracting
 
05:51:33.948 --> 05:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
municipal's actual costs of carrying out
 
05:51:35.270 --> 05:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
the functions required in the
 
05:51:38.690 --> 05:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
subdivision and later it defers to the
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration and
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Education to
 
05:51:44.230 --> 05:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
determine what those carrying costs are
 
05:51:47.030 --> 05:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
I would like to and hope the committee
 
05:51:49.850 --> 05:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
would entertain an amendment that would
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh spell out what those carrying costs
 
05:51:55.788 --> 05:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
can be considered uh otherwise it's at
 
05:51:57.530 --> 05:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
the full discretion of the two
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh although I'm sure
 
05:52:03.288 --> 05:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
they'll give due consideration in the
 
05:52:05.990 --> 05:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
regulation development uh but I would
 
05:52:08.150 --> 05:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
like to see a recognition that there are
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
carrying costs to any property tax
 
05:52:12.650 --> 05:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
collection system which includes the
 
05:52:14.510 --> 05:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
assessment of the property the billing
 
05:52:17.330 --> 05:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
costs The Collection costs including
 
05:52:20.628 --> 05:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
Administration lien and deeding costs uh
 
05:52:23.868 --> 05:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
the cost of abatements which can be over
 
05:52:26.628 --> 05:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
multiple years not just the current past
 
05:52:29.150 --> 05:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
year so they have to be recognized over
 
05:52:31.850 --> 05:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
uh two or more year period and of course
 
05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
the lost interest income that if these
 
05:52:37.430 --> 05:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
funds need to be turned over to the
 
05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
state uh in an immediate faction after
 
05:52:42.170 --> 05:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
the tax billing then there's no ability
 
05:52:44.448 --> 05:52:44.458 align:start position:0%
or there's the loss function of a town
 
05:52:46.970 --> 05:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
to have investment income off those
 
05:52:49.070 --> 05:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
revenues so these are all carrying costs
 
05:52:51.230 --> 05:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
that I think should be identified and
 
05:52:53.150 --> 05:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
directed The Commissioners in their
 
05:52:56.570 --> 05:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
process and determining uh what those
 
05:52:58.190 --> 05:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
carrying costs are and then what they
 
05:53:00.948 --> 05:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
should be in deducting out from the 28
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's going to be
 
05:53:05.628 --> 05:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
collected so uh with that I'll leave my
 
05:53:08.448 --> 05:53:08.458 align:start position:0%
testimony at that and let the written
 
05:53:10.430 --> 05:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
testimony coming subsequently to speak
 
05:53:14.230 --> 05:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
would you take questions
 
05:53:21.410 --> 05:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:23.090 --> 05:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm you
 
05:53:23.100 --> 05:53:30.190 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm you
foreign

05:53:30.190 --> 05:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
sorry about that I just wanted it's not
 
05:53:34.490 --> 05:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
really a question I just want to say

amendment to that at the appropriate

time uh it's the establishment of a
 
05:58:57.128 --> 05:58:57.138 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds restoration account
 
05:59:03.230 --> 05:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
under RSA 478 17K to retain an
 
05:59:06.170 --> 05:59:06.180 align:start position:0%

restoration of land records and it
 
05:59:12.480 --> 05:59:13.850 align:start position:0%
restoration of land records and it
continues

05:59:13.850 --> 05:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
continues
 
05:59:16.490 --> 05:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
I have served my County delegation for
 
05:59:18.530 --> 05:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
more than seven terms and have been told
 
05:59:21.470 --> 05:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
repeatedly by my registrar that the cost
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
to preserve our oldest land documents is
 
05:59:26.930 --> 05:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
more is a presently a cost of more than
 
05:59:29.270 --> 05:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh 11 million dollars
 
05:59:31.730 --> 05:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
while we Whittle away at our need
 
05:59:33.948 --> 05:59:33.958 align:start position:0%
registrar Lisa Scott
 
05:59:36.470 --> 05:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
asked if the legislature might find a
 
05:59:39.230 --> 05:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
way to contribute after much discussion
 
05:59:43.250 --> 05:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
with my registrar Lisa Scott and she
 
05:59:46.190 --> 05:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
with her fellow registrars We Believe
 
05:59:49.970 --> 05:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
House Bill 624 is that vehicle
 
05:59:52.850 --> 05:59:52.860 align:start position:0%
a letter uh was sent to the committee
 
05:59:55.690 --> 05:59:55.700 align:start position:0%
and I hope you have which was uh
 
05:59:58.610 --> 05:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
signed by eight of the ten registrars
 
06:00:01.490 --> 06:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
offering their support for House Bill
 
06:00:01.500 --> 06:00:03.230 align:start position:0%
offering their support for House Bill
621

06:00:03.230 --> 06:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
621
 
06:00:06.770 --> 06:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
and while Kathy and Stacy the Rockingham
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
register did not sign the letter of
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
endorsement she did also send a letter
 
06:00:16.070 --> 06:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
to the committee dated February 5th and
 
06:00:17.448 --> 06:00:17.458 align:start position:0%
that she says
 
06:00:20.270 --> 06:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
not every County makes a commitment nor
 
06:00:22.610 --> 06:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
can registrars commit funds for
 
06:00:25.010 --> 06:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
preservation without the approval of the
 
06:00:26.930 --> 06:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
commission is a delegation
 
06:00:29.270 --> 06:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the importance of these
 
06:00:31.850 --> 06:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
historical land records in many cases is
 
06:00:34.368 --> 06:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
ignored should registration of the
 
06:00:36.830 --> 06:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
historical land records continue to be
 
06:00:36.840 --> 06:00:38.090 align:start position:0%
historical land records continue to be
ignored

06:00:38.090 --> 06:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
ignored
 
06:00:40.368 --> 06:00:40.378 align:start position:0%
the result could be permanent
 
06:00:43.730 --> 06:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
destruction due to deterioration of
 
06:00:46.970 --> 06:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
these fragile documents in turn results
 
06:00:49.850 --> 06:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
in the inability of research the title
 
06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
to the land
 
06:00:53.510 --> 06:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
how many Property Owners obtained clear
 
06:00:56.530 --> 06:00:56.540 align:start position:0%
title a mortgage or sell their property
 
06:00:59.150 --> 06:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
the land and Heritage investment program
 
06:01:01.730 --> 06:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
can be applauded for its work to protect
 
06:01:04.430 --> 06:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
Community landmarks but what good is a
 
06:01:07.610 --> 06:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
landmark if historical title data cannot
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
be accessed at the registry of deeds
 
06:01:13.610 --> 06:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
before and there'll be many behind me
 
06:01:15.410 --> 06:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
with my red straw and others with more
 
06:01:18.410 --> 06:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
to say but before I end my testimony I'd
 
06:01:19.850 --> 06:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
like to address the physical node
 
06:01:23.030 --> 06:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
attached on the original uh Ed on this
 
06:01:23.040 --> 06:01:24.530 align:start position:0%
attached on the original uh Ed on this
LSR

06:01:24.530 --> 06:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
LSR
 
06:01:27.830 --> 06:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
and um if amended I don't presume that
 
06:01:30.048 --> 06:01:30.058 align:start position:0%
will change it would appear to me that
 
06:01:32.270 --> 06:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
the land and Community Heritage
 
06:01:35.930 --> 06:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
investment program l-chip funds nearly
 
06:01:39.350 --> 06:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
33 projects on an average year those
 
06:01:42.230 --> 06:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
projects are are if you were to average
 
06:01:43.970 --> 06:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
amount or about a hundred and twenty one
 
06:01:46.010 --> 06:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a piece
 
06:01:48.170 --> 06:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
the physical note said the anticipated
 
06:01:53.930 --> 06:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
cost of this house bill would be 350 350
 
06:01:55.810 --> 06:01:55.820 align:start position:0%
000 annually
 
06:01:59.470 --> 06:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
which in which in my mind might result
 
06:02:02.930 --> 06:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
in three less projects being granted
 
06:02:05.690 --> 06:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
annually while I respect the work that's
 
06:02:07.930 --> 06:02:07.940 align:start position:0%
done by l-chip
 
06:02:11.930 --> 06:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
I believe that our bill here is worthy
 
06:02:15.110 --> 06:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
of your consideration because those land
 
06:02:17.930 --> 06:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
records are also historical documents
 
06:02:19.730 --> 06:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
that need to be funded
 
06:02:22.670 --> 06:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
I am happy to take any questions and I
 
06:02:24.650 --> 06:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
will remind you that my registrar has
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%

maintenance of the official land record
 
06:05:15.410 --> 06:05:15.420 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire RSA 227 M colon 1. which
 
06:05:27.470 --> 06:05:27.480 align:start position:0%

community Heritage investment program
 
06:05:32.330 --> 06:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
it states that the intent of the program
 
06:05:35.330 --> 06:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
is to conserve and preserve the state's
 
06:05:38.510 --> 06:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
most important natural cultural and
 
06:05:40.368 --> 06:05:40.378 align:start position:0%
historical resources
 
06:05:42.948 --> 06:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
through the acquisition of lands and
 
06:05:45.590 --> 06:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
cultural and historical resources or
 
06:05:47.628 --> 06:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
interests they're in
 
06:05:49.910 --> 06:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes that the official
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
land record cared for at the registry of
 
06:05:54.110 --> 06:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
deeds offices
 
06:05:56.390 --> 06:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
is a significant cultural and historical
 
06:05:59.330 --> 06:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
resource worthy of support of the
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%

06:06:01.200 --> 06:06:03.470 align:start position:0%

06:06:03.470 --> 06:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:06:06.530 --> 06:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
l-chip projects require proof of clear
 
06:06:09.288 --> 06:06:09.298 align:start position:0%
title and a survey plan
 
06:06:11.628 --> 06:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
both of which can only be achieved
 
06:06:13.490 --> 06:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
through researching the records of the
 
06:06:15.230 --> 06:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds
 
06:06:17.448 --> 06:06:17.458 align:start position:0%
this fact demonstrates the close
 
06:06:19.128 --> 06:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
relationship between the registry
 
06:06:21.230 --> 06:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
records and the land in the human
 
06:06:24.410 --> 06:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
Community Heritage investment program
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
l-chip grants rely on the evidence found
 
06:06:29.570 --> 06:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
in the deeds and the plans recorded with
 
06:06:32.510 --> 06:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.910 --> 06:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
registry records are the foundation upon
 
06:06:37.670 --> 06:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
which l-chip projects rest
 
06:06:39.470 --> 06:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
and all infrastructures require
 
06:06:39.480 --> 06:06:40.730 align:start position:0%
and all infrastructures require
maintenance

06:06:40.730 --> 06:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
06:06:43.670 --> 06:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
the cost to repair and restore deeds and
 
06:06:45.470 --> 06:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
plans is very high
 
06:06:47.990 --> 06:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
and is currently born completely by the
 
06:06:48.000 --> 06:06:49.310 align:start position:0%
and is currently born completely by the
counties

06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
counties
 
06:06:51.410 --> 06:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars are needed to
 
06:06:53.750 --> 06:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
properly care for the documents
 
06:06:55.548 --> 06:06:55.558 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will provide
 
06:06:58.730 --> 06:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
Registries funds to support restoration
 
06:07:01.010 --> 06:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
of the documents without raising
 
06:07:04.730 --> 06:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
additional fees or taxes
 
06:07:07.490 --> 06:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
if passed the funds would only be used
 
06:07:09.170 --> 06:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
to repair and restore the registry
 
06:07:09.180 --> 06:07:10.430 align:start position:0%
to repair and restore the registry
records

06:07:10.430 --> 06:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
records
 
06:07:11.990 --> 06:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
and it would be supporting the
 
06:07:13.970 --> 06:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
infrastructure which confirms our land
 
06:07:16.070 --> 06:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
in our community heritage
 
06:07:18.708 --> 06:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
and our property rights
 
06:07:23.270 --> 06:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
I ask here to support HB 621
 
06:07:27.048 --> 06:07:27.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:29.868 --> 06:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
Victoria testimony Mrs Scott
 
06:07:32.690 --> 06:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
um we do take any questions
 
06:07:36.530 --> 06:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:40.670 --> 06:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and Scott on I was
 
06:07:42.830 --> 06:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
on my County delegation executive
 
06:07:45.470 --> 06:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
committee for 10 years something like
 
06:07:48.288 --> 06:07:48.298 align:start position:0%
that and I remember
 
06:07:53.270 --> 06:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
um that the Deeds office does more than
 
06:07:57.770 --> 06:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
pay for itself all the time and that the
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
money provided from that uh in our case
 
06:08:04.548 --> 06:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
in Grafton went
 
06:08:09.770 --> 06:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
and goes to the upkeep of the Register
 
06:08:13.490 --> 06:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
of Deeds office including a very
 
06:08:16.788 --> 06:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
long-term project working on this and
 
06:08:20.810 --> 06:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether uh somebody among
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
you is going to be able to tell us how
 
06:08:26.150 --> 06:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
much money has been put
 
06:08:29.930 --> 06:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
forth to this over the last five years
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
say and uh how far you've gotten back in
 
06:08:35.628 --> 06:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
your Deeds records we'd gotten back
 
06:08:38.930 --> 06:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
quite a ways when I left the executive
 
06:08:41.930 --> 06:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
committee on and
 
06:08:44.868 --> 06:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
um whether any of it gets taken off for
 
06:08:48.470 --> 06:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
other functions of the county thank you
 
06:08:48.480 --> 06:08:53.448 align:start position:0%
other functions of the county thank you
foreign

06:08:53.448 --> 06:08:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:56.990 --> 06:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
over the past five years four years here
 
06:08:58.368 --> 06:08:58.378 align:start position:0%
at the registry
 
06:09:00.590 --> 06:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
Carroll County has spent
 
06:09:02.810 --> 06:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
approximately six hundred thousand
 
06:09:05.090 --> 06:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
dollars on restoration of the records
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
and archival work
 
06:09:11.570 --> 06:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
and yet we have gotten
 
06:09:14.390 --> 06:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
through book one
 
06:09:14.400 --> 06:09:17.570 align:start position:0%
through book one
35.

06:09:17.570 --> 06:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:21.590 --> 06:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
which is significant but it's not very
 
06:09:24.110 --> 06:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
far into the books we're in book 3000
 
06:09:25.190 --> 06:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:09:27.410 --> 06:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
we haven't started on the plans and the
 
06:09:29.990 --> 06:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
plans are the majority of the cost
 
06:09:32.330 --> 06:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
our delegation and the Commissioners
 
06:09:35.570 --> 06:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
take this very seriously and have put
 
06:09:38.090 --> 06:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
significant funds as you can tell from
 
06:09:41.570 --> 06:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
the past five four years this year we
 
06:09:44.810 --> 06:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
ask for more as well and yet the project
 
06:09:46.670 --> 06:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
is so large
 
06:09:46.680 --> 06:09:48.410 align:start position:0%
is so large
that

06:09:48.410 --> 06:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:09:48.420 --> 06:09:50.030 align:start position:0%
that
it's

06:09:50.030 --> 06:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:09:52.788 --> 06:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
a burden to the county
 
06:09:54.530 --> 06:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
yes the county
 
06:09:58.250 --> 06:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
does receive funding over and above what
 
06:10:00.590 --> 06:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
the costs of the Deeds office are
 
06:10:03.708 --> 06:10:03.718 align:start position:0%
and it is found the delegation has found
 
06:10:06.410 --> 06:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
it necessary to use some of those funds
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
for other County functions
 
06:10:10.368 --> 06:10:10.378 align:start position:0%
I ask every year
 
06:10:10.378 --> 06:10:11.750 align:start position:0%
I ask every year
to

06:10:11.750 --> 06:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:10:15.470 --> 06:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
keep those funds within this office but
 
06:10:19.490 --> 06:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's all I can do is to ask it's a big
 
06:10:21.170 --> 06:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
problem for the counties particularly
 
06:10:23.990 --> 06:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
the smaller counties that don't have
 
06:10:30.610 --> 06:10:30.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:36.230 --> 06:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:36.240 --> 06:10:37.788 align:start position:0%

Tucker
 
06:10:39.410 --> 06:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
no I
 
06:10:41.208 --> 06:10:41.218 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask the very same
 
06:10:43.150 --> 06:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
question so I put my hand in
 
06:10:45.948 --> 06:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley
 
06:10:48.110 --> 06:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I thank you very
 
06:10:49.430 --> 06:10:49.440 align:start position:0%

um thank you for your testimony
 
06:10:55.070 --> 06:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
um is it Miss Scott
 
06:10:56.750 --> 06:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
um let's just make sure we all
 
06:10:58.250 --> 06:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
understand so four percent there's
 
06:11:00.770 --> 06:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
currently a four percent surcharge
 
06:11:03.170 --> 06:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
on top of the real estate transfer tax
 
06:11:05.770 --> 06:11:05.780 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the El chip
 
06:11:11.150 --> 06:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
surcharge which is assessed on four
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
different documents 25 dollar per
 
06:11:18.610 --> 06:11:18.620 align:start position:0%
document document fee
 
06:11:22.548 --> 06:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
and as an administrative
 
06:11:26.510 --> 06:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
costs the counties keep four percent and
 
06:11:28.970 --> 06:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
the 96 percent goes to the state which
 
06:11:31.310 --> 06:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
then in turn gives it to the l-chip
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
trust fund right I already know we are
 
06:11:37.368 --> 06:11:37.378 align:start position:0%
asking for an additional 10 percent
 
06:11:40.128 --> 06:11:40.138 align:start position:0%
of that fee
 
06:11:42.890 --> 06:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
for the specific purpose of restoration
 
06:11:45.288 --> 06:11:45.298 align:start position:0%
and repair of the records just follow up
 
06:11:48.410 --> 06:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
on make sure I understand so of the of
 
06:11:50.390 --> 06:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
the four percent on these document fees
 
06:11:53.570 --> 06:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's going to to LT if you you would
 
06:11:56.150 --> 06:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
like to see up to 10 percent
 
06:11:59.448 --> 06:11:59.458 align:start position:0%
uh taken from lchip and used for this
 
06:12:03.830 --> 06:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:06.708 --> 06:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
would you allow me to reword that
 
06:12:08.208 --> 06:12:08.218 align:start position:0%
yeah that's why I asked the question yes
 
06:12:12.048 --> 06:12:12.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:15.770 --> 06:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
four documents recorded with 25 worth of
 
06:12:19.910 --> 06:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
fees each hundred dollars when at the
 
06:12:22.490 --> 06:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
end of the month we send our money to
 
06:12:24.590 --> 06:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire four percent
 
06:12:27.410 --> 06:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
is withheld to the county and given to
 
06:12:29.690 --> 06:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
the treasurer to administer
 
06:12:32.810 --> 06:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
collecting the funds we're asking for an
 
06:12:34.448 --> 06:12:34.458 align:start position:0%
additional 10
 
06:12:37.970 --> 06:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
an additional 10 percent to be retained
 
06:12:40.430 --> 06:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
by the county and put in a separate
 
06:12:42.830 --> 06:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
designated fund specifically for the use
 
06:12:45.470 --> 06:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
of repair and restoration of the records
 
06:12:49.490 --> 06:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
therefore we'd be sending 86 percent of
 
06:12:52.368 --> 06:12:52.378 align:start position:0%
the funds received for l-chip
 
06:12:54.170 --> 06:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire which
 
06:12:56.208 --> 06:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
would then pass it on to the l-chip
 
06:12:56.218 --> 06:12:57.890 align:start position:0%
would then pass it on to the l-chip
trust

06:12:57.890 --> 06:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
trust
 
06:13:00.410 --> 06:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
all right I'm a little confused I'm
 
06:13:02.990 --> 06:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
usually not this thick so
 
06:13:07.430 --> 06:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
um so does will L chip get less money
 
06:13:10.010 --> 06:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
for their normal purposes uh from this I
 
06:13:11.208 --> 06:13:11.218 align:start position:0%
guess it's another way of trying to
 
06:13:13.390 --> 06:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
06:13:18.590 --> 06:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
l-chip will receive less funds for their
 
06:13:18.600 --> 06:13:20.510 align:start position:0%
l-chip will receive less funds for their
[Music]

06:13:20.510 --> 06:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:13:20.520 --> 06:13:21.650 align:start position:0%
[Music]
yes

06:13:21.650 --> 06:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:13:25.490 --> 06:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
the answer is uh you complicated yes
 
06:13:29.890 --> 06:13:29.900 align:start position:0%
because I believe that the l-chip
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
Grant the law
 
06:13:35.750 --> 06:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
includes land and cultural heritage
 
06:13:39.650 --> 06:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
which Deeds are a part of that plans are
 
06:13:43.788 --> 06:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
a part of that we hold here the
 
06:13:48.190 --> 06:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
documents that prove that l-chip grants
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:55.368 --> 06:13:55.378 align:start position:0%
so in my mind the Deeds fall under the
 
06:13:55.378 --> 06:13:57.890 align:start position:0%
so in my mind the Deeds fall under the
l-chip

06:13:57.890 --> 06:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
l-chip
 
06:13:57.900 --> 06:13:59.090 align:start position:0%
l-chip
law

06:13:59.090 --> 06:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:14:02.390 --> 06:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
and so would l-chip receive the ex that
 
06:14:04.610 --> 06:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
10 percent
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't get the money in hand but
 
06:14:10.310 --> 06:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
the money would be spent to justify
 
06:14:13.670 --> 06:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
their projects representative Romney if
 
06:14:16.670 --> 06:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
you look at the fiscal note L chip gets
 
06:14:16.680 --> 06:14:17.990 align:start position:0%
you look at the fiscal note L chip gets
about

06:14:17.990 --> 06:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:14:20.288 --> 06:14:20.298 align:start position:0%
three and a half million dollars a year
 
06:14:22.910 --> 06:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
from this special assessment for
 
06:14:26.090 --> 06:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
documents and what they're asking for is
 
06:14:29.990 --> 06:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
ten percent of that which is about 350
 
06:14:32.690 --> 06:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
000 a year the whole toys this
 
06:14:32.700 --> 06:14:34.730 align:start position:0%
000 a year the whole toys this
restoration

06:14:34.730 --> 06:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
restoration
 
06:14:37.548 --> 06:14:37.558 align:start position:0%
350 000 does not go to l-chip for other
 
06:14:40.250 --> 06:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
purposes correct right that's what I
 
06:14:41.990 --> 06:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
want to clarify thank you yeah I read
 
06:14:46.610 --> 06:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:46.620 --> 06:14:48.948 align:start position:0%
 
represented

06:14:48.948 --> 06:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
represented
 
06:14:48.958 --> 06:14:52.730 align:start position:0%
represented
Hamburg

06:14:52.730 --> 06:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:55.910 --> 06:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm I'm
 
06:14:58.128 --> 06:14:58.138 align:start position:0%
I guess the question I have Miss Scott
 
06:15:01.810 --> 06:15:01.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman is that
 
06:15:05.208 --> 06:15:05.218 align:start position:0%
you're wanting another 10 on top of the
 
06:15:07.490 --> 06:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
present four percent
 
06:15:07.500 --> 06:15:08.750 align:start position:0%
present four percent
that

06:15:08.750 --> 06:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:15:13.788 --> 06:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
is presently taken out of the surcharge
 
06:15:13.798 --> 06:15:15.230 align:start position:0%
is presently taken out of the surcharge
and

06:15:15.230 --> 06:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:15:19.310 --> 06:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
is this number 350 000 including is this
 
06:15:22.970 --> 06:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
the total will be 14 now is that 350 000
 
06:15:25.430 --> 06:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
or is there or is it higher is it like
 
06:15:28.730 --> 06:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
more 400 and some thousand that will be
 
06:15:28.740 --> 06:15:31.850 align:start position:0%
more 400 and some thousand that will be
taken

06:15:31.850 --> 06:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:31.860 --> 06:15:34.128 align:start position:0%
 
overall

06:15:34.128 --> 06:15:34.138 align:start position:0%
overall
 
06:15:37.430 --> 06:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
it would be a total of 14 taken whatever
 
06:15:40.490 --> 06:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
amount is taken and this past year
 
06:15:44.270 --> 06:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
Carroll County uh well I I can't address
 
06:15:48.470 --> 06:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
how much money l-chip has received from
 
06:15:52.910 --> 06:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
the L chip uh surcharge except for what
 
06:15:56.628 --> 06:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
is on the uh initial bill which says it
 
06:15:59.150 --> 06:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
was 3.5 million
 
06:16:01.548 --> 06:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
14 of that would be retained at the
 
06:16:04.030 --> 06:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
county level each County would get 14
 
06:16:11.570 --> 06:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:14.750 --> 06:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:14.760 --> 06:16:17.830 align:start position:0%
 
when

06:16:17.830 --> 06:16:17.840 align:start position:0%

06:16:24.170 --> 06:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
testify and support and representative
 
06:16:28.310 --> 06:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
McConkey said he would need four minutes
 
06:16:31.250 --> 06:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
isn't he the prime sponsor that he spoke
 
06:16:35.390 --> 06:16:35.400 align:start position:0%

Sheila Vargas next is that right it
 
06:16:41.208 --> 06:16:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:44.868 --> 06:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
yes Sheila Vargas okay
 
06:16:47.090 --> 06:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
in the lobbyists from the nature of
 
06:16:47.100 --> 06:16:48.230 align:start position:0%
in the lobbyists from the nature of
conservative

06:16:48.230 --> 06:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
conservative
 
06:16:51.288 --> 06:16:51.298 align:start position:0%
and opposes the bill
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
and needs three minutes
 
06:16:56.990 --> 06:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman major I hope my audio
 
06:17:00.250 --> 06:17:00.260 align:start position:0%
is all right and I am hoping I can also
 
06:17:02.690 --> 06:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
spare all of you and not use the
 
06:17:04.910 --> 06:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
entirety of the three minutes as I have
 
06:17:09.548 --> 06:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:12.470 --> 06:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
I would also just like to State for the
 
06:17:15.170 --> 06:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
record my name is Sheila Vargas I'm the
 
06:17:16.788 --> 06:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
government and community relations
 
06:17:19.190 --> 06:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
manager for the nature conservancy in
 
06:17:21.470 --> 06:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I am here testifying
 
06:17:25.548 --> 06:17:25.558 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill 621 FN and I
 
06:17:28.190 --> 06:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
will be testifying not only for The
 
06:17:30.350 --> 06:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
Nature Conservancy but also for New
 
06:17:32.810 --> 06:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Audubon for the Appalachian
 
06:17:35.810 --> 06:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
Mountain club and New Hampshire Lakes we
 
06:17:38.270 --> 06:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
have provided joint testimony for you
 
06:17:38.280 --> 06:17:40.010 align:start position:0%
have provided joint testimony for you
today

06:17:40.010 --> 06:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:17:43.910 --> 06:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
so we are opposed to this bill for a
 
06:17:45.590 --> 06:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
number of reasons
 
06:17:47.990 --> 06:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
currently I'll check fees are collected
 
06:17:50.390 --> 06:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
from recording fees assessed for certain
 
06:17:53.270 --> 06:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
documents as you heard by the 10 New
 
06:17:55.190 --> 06:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire County register of deeds and
 
06:17:56.990 --> 06:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
transferred to the state treasury into
 
06:17:59.448 --> 06:17:59.458 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund which is administered
 
06:18:02.090 --> 06:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
by the l-chip program so I'm just going
 
06:18:04.970 --> 06:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
to skip over some of uh the housekeeping
 
06:18:07.010 --> 06:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
portions of our opposition as you've
 
06:18:07.020 --> 06:18:07.850 align:start position:0%
portions of our opposition as you've
heard

06:18:07.850 --> 06:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
heard
 
06:18:10.970 --> 06:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
um the reasons why and how the funds go
 
06:18:13.548 --> 06:18:13.558 align:start position:0%
into the dedicated fund that was created
 
06:18:18.650 --> 06:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
by RSA 227m I would like to note uh the
 
06:18:21.470 --> 06:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
previous individuals who testified in
 
06:18:23.288 --> 06:18:23.298 align:start position:0%
support of the bill
 
06:18:26.810 --> 06:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
clearly stated that the dedicated fund
 
06:18:31.610 --> 06:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
RSA 227m does state that the funds are
 
06:18:34.070 --> 06:18:34.080 align:start position:0%

state's most important natural cultural
 
06:18:39.170 --> 06:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
and historical resources what they
 
06:18:42.048 --> 06:18:42.058 align:start position:0%
failed to continue with that statement
 
06:18:45.048 --> 06:18:45.058 align:start position:0%
and continue saying was the remainder of
 
06:18:48.110 --> 06:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
that RSA a which clearly states through
 
06:18:50.690 --> 06:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
the acquisition of lands and cultural
 
06:18:53.150 --> 06:18:53.160 align:start position:0%

06:18:55.128 --> 06:18:55.138 align:start position:0%

Regional and Statewide significance in
 
06:19:01.850 --> 06:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
partnership with the state's
 
06:19:03.948 --> 06:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the private sector
 
06:19:07.070 --> 06:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
for the primary purposes of protecting
 
06:19:09.770 --> 06:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
and ensuring the Perpetual contributions
 
06:19:11.990 --> 06:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
of these resources to the state's
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
economy environment and overall quality
 
06:19:19.670 --> 06:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
of life nothing within this RSA if read
 
06:19:22.610 --> 06:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
in its entirety it states that these
 
06:19:24.830 --> 06:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
funds can should be used for the
 
06:19:31.430 --> 06:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:33.410 --> 06:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm just I'm getting a little
 
06:19:36.650 --> 06:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
feedback from someone's mic I think uh
 
06:19:38.930 --> 06:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
finally the bill would deprive a popular
 
06:19:41.750 --> 06:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
and over subscribed program of needed
 
06:19:43.970 --> 06:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
Revenue to fulfill its statutory
 
06:19:47.090 --> 06:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
obligation aside from the obligations of
 
06:19:49.310 --> 06:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining the Integrity of l-chip's
 
06:19:51.650 --> 06:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund there is also a clear
 
06:19:54.410 --> 06:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
need to prevent any funds from being
 
06:19:56.208 --> 06:19:56.218 align:start position:0%
diverted from this highly popular
 
06:19:58.730 --> 06:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
program from which applicants for
 
06:20:01.490 --> 06:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
funding consistently exceed the funds
 
06:20:05.330 --> 06:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
available and I believe digit who is
 
06:20:07.970 --> 06:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
with l-chip is here to testify and can
 
06:20:12.288 --> 06:20:12.298 align:start position:0%
speak to that more closely alchem is
 
06:20:15.230 --> 06:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
often held up in our state as a model
 
06:20:17.390 --> 06:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
for how State dollars can achieve
 
06:20:19.310 --> 06:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous leverage and bring tangible
 
06:20:21.830 --> 06:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
benefits to the state's people this is
 
06:20:23.208 --> 06:20:23.218 align:start position:0%
something we should be looking to build
 
06:20:26.208 --> 06:20:26.218 align:start position:0%
upon and not weaken a big part of the
 
06:20:28.070 --> 06:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
success of this model is its Statewide
 
06:20:30.410 --> 06:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
Focus along with dedicated and trained
 
06:20:32.810 --> 06:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
staff capacity to make sure resources
 
06:20:34.610 --> 06:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
are being used in the most effective way
 
06:20:37.310 --> 06:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
possible l-chip has trained professional
 
06:20:39.830 --> 06:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
staff and qualified boards at board
 
06:20:41.390 --> 06:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
members that work with a variety of
 
06:20:43.190 --> 06:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to make judgments and
 
06:20:46.070 --> 06:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
decisions to ensure LG expenditures are
 
06:20:49.490 --> 06:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
in the public interest I would also like
 
06:20:51.350 --> 06:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
to note that this bill is frankly
 
06:20:53.750 --> 06:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary as counties can raise the
 
06:20:55.430 --> 06:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
capital needed to meet their needs
 
06:20:58.910 --> 06:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
without rating a state program the
 
06:21:00.890 --> 06:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
counties do set their own budgets as you
 
06:21:02.930 --> 06:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
are well aware raise their own revenue
 
06:21:05.510 --> 06:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
and have access to Municipal and private
 
06:21:07.548 --> 06:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
sector bonds which are at historically
 
06:21:10.490 --> 06:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
low interest rates currently all of
 
06:21:12.590 --> 06:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
these options are available to meet the
 
06:21:14.810 --> 06:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
priorities of County government these
 
06:21:16.548 --> 06:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
options would also provide the counties
 
06:21:19.250 --> 06:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
a quicker and more holistic solution to
 
06:21:21.410 --> 06:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
achieving their goals the proposed
 
06:21:24.110 --> 06:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
l-chip fund raid brings in only a small
 
06:21:26.090 --> 06:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
percentage of the funding necessary to
 
06:21:28.730 --> 06:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
complete the proposed work meaning many
 
06:21:30.590 --> 06:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
years will be required to complete the
 
06:21:32.570 --> 06:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
task there other funding options
 
06:21:35.270 --> 06:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
available to the counties as you clearly
 
06:21:36.830 --> 06:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
just heard from the previous speaker
 
06:21:39.770 --> 06:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
that would more quickly meet the needs
 
06:21:42.170 --> 06:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
and are better aligned with the proposed
 
06:21:42.180 --> 06:21:43.090 align:start position:0%
and are better aligned with the proposed
project

06:21:43.090 --> 06:21:43.100 align:start position:0%
project
 
06:21:45.948 --> 06:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
with that and actually before I before I
 
06:21:48.708 --> 06:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
conclude I would like to note that
 
06:21:50.690 --> 06:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
according to l-chip every dollar
 
06:21:52.788 --> 06:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
invested by this program into our
 
06:21:54.590 --> 06:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
state's natural and historic resources
 
06:21:56.990 --> 06:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
leverages an additional five dollars in
 
06:21:59.390 --> 06:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
investment which makes l-chip a very
 
06:22:02.930 --> 06:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
efficient use of public dollars and so
 
06:22:05.090 --> 06:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
with that our organizations New
 
06:22:07.250 --> 06:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes The Nature Conservancy
 
06:22:09.048 --> 06:22:09.058 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Audubon and the
 
06:22:11.510 --> 06:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Mountain Club jointly ask
 
06:22:13.670 --> 06:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
that this committee vote and expedient
 
06:22:16.250 --> 06:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
to legislate on this bill and continue
 
06:22:18.410 --> 06:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
our state's long-standing tradition of
 
06:22:20.868 --> 06:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
not only valuing our natural resources
 
06:22:23.628 --> 06:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
but also upholding the Integrity of a
 
06:22:25.670 --> 06:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund with a long history of
 
06:22:25.680 --> 06:22:29.650 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund with a long history of
bipartisanship

06:22:29.650 --> 06:22:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:34.128 --> 06:22:34.138 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony Mrs vagus
 
06:22:37.910 --> 06:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh questions from the committee
 
06:22:40.128 --> 06:22:40.138 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
06:22:43.010 --> 06:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
saying none and we will go on to a will
 
06:22:47.930 --> 06:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
Stewart proposal lobbyist with uh
 
06:22:50.990 --> 06:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
stay work play New Hampshire in
 
06:22:54.590 --> 06:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and it says two
 
06:22:54.600 --> 06:22:55.970 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and it says two
minutes

06:22:55.970 --> 06:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
06:22:58.368 --> 06:22:58.378 align:start position:0%
and let's see how close he goes to two
 
06:22:58.378 --> 06:22:59.708 align:start position:0%
and let's see how close he goes to two
minutes

06:22:59.708 --> 06:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
06:23:02.570 --> 06:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I will try to keep
 
06:23:05.330 --> 06:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
it under two minutes for sure
 
06:23:08.570 --> 06:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
um again for the record stay work play
 
06:23:10.730 --> 06:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
uh I'm will Stewart the executive
 
06:23:13.010 --> 06:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
director and stay work play is a
 
06:23:15.410 --> 06:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide non-profit whose mission is to
 
06:23:18.530 --> 06:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
attract and retain young people
 
06:23:20.330 --> 06:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
um you might recall I was before the
 
06:23:22.250 --> 06:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
committee this morning talking about the
 
06:23:24.470 --> 06:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
study committee with regard to you know
 
06:23:28.010 --> 06:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
child care and uh here again to um to
 
06:23:30.110 --> 06:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
speak to this bill and to State our
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
opposition I think Ms Vargas you know
 
06:23:35.510 --> 06:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
gave a great explanation of why it's a
 
06:23:38.030 --> 06:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
bad idea and uh you might recall in my
 
06:23:40.010 --> 06:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony I mentioned that about
 
06:23:41.570 --> 06:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
three years ago that stay work play
 
06:23:43.970 --> 06:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
commissioned a survey to collect data on
 
06:23:46.070 --> 06:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
why young people you know stay in and
 
06:23:48.530 --> 06:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
might leave New Hampshire and uh the
 
06:23:50.628 --> 06:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
number one reason we found and that uh
 
06:23:52.910 --> 06:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
in that survey that young people stay
 
06:23:54.830 --> 06:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
here is access to our state's
 
06:23:57.230 --> 06:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
unparalleled natural resources and we
 
06:23:59.208 --> 06:23:59.218 align:start position:0%
heard this again last fall and winter as
 
06:24:00.890 --> 06:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
we talked to young people in nine
 
06:24:02.810 --> 06:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
locations across the state as part of
 
06:24:04.670 --> 06:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
our policy and pint series
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
so you know to our mind we want to do
 
06:24:09.650 --> 06:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
all that we can to to maintain and to
 
06:24:11.628 --> 06:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
the extent we can enhance you know our
 
06:24:14.448 --> 06:24:14.458 align:start position:0%
state's uh natural resources our our
 
06:24:17.390 --> 06:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
Golden Goose if you will and uh so you
 
06:24:20.390 --> 06:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
know we oppose on principle any uh
 
06:24:23.570 --> 06:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
any proposition to reduce or or kill
 
06:24:25.128 --> 06:24:25.138 align:start position:0%
this Golden Goose that is our state's
 
06:24:27.288 --> 06:24:27.298 align:start position:0%
natural resources and for that reason
 
06:24:29.750 --> 06:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know we ask you to uh to vote in
 
06:24:31.368 --> 06:24:31.378 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on this Bill
 
06:24:34.788 --> 06:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Stewart uh any
 
06:24:34.798 --> 06:24:39.250 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Stewart uh any
questions

06:24:39.250 --> 06:24:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:41.770 --> 06:24:41.780 align:start position:0%
we go to
 
06:24:45.530 --> 06:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:48.170 --> 06:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
suppose go to the bill
 
06:24:51.110 --> 06:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I signed up I
 
06:24:52.730 --> 06:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
may have signed up apparently because I
 
06:24:54.548 --> 06:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
signed up because the prime sponsor
 
06:24:56.690 --> 06:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey asked me to
 
06:24:58.850 --> 06:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
introduce an amendment to the bill but
 
06:25:00.470 --> 06:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
is that amendment to be introduced
 
06:25:02.090 --> 06:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
during a work session or would you want
 
06:25:04.270 --> 06:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
to introduce now
 
06:25:08.090 --> 06:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
you could introduce it now uh but you
 
06:25:11.150 --> 06:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
can also introduce in the work session
 
06:25:13.310 --> 06:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
okay well I guess in the interest of
 
06:25:14.990 --> 06:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
time we'll we'll introduce it in the
 
06:25:17.990 --> 06:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
work session it's a minor change that
 
06:25:18.000 --> 06:25:19.310 align:start position:0%
work session it's a minor change that
clarifies

06:25:19.310 --> 06:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
06:25:21.410 --> 06:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
um and creates a register of deeds
 
06:25:26.570 --> 06:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
restoration account under RSA 478 17K so
 
06:25:28.368 --> 06:25:28.378 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward so I think
 
06:25:31.490 --> 06:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
we'll introduce I can introduce it
 
06:25:33.708 --> 06:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
during our work session I thank you
 
06:25:33.718 --> 06:25:35.810 align:start position:0%
during our work session I thank you
representative

06:25:35.810 --> 06:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:25:37.860 --> 06:25:37.870 align:start position:0%
thank you the um
 
06:25:37.870 --> 06:25:39.350 align:start position:0%
thank you the um
[Music]

06:25:39.350 --> 06:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:25:42.170 --> 06:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
on the list that I have unless there's
 
06:25:45.230 --> 06:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
somebody else in the attendee I just let
 
06:25:48.410 --> 06:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
digit Taylor in she was the last one
 
06:25:55.850 --> 06:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:00.170 --> 06:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
yes she signed up for zero minutes
 
06:26:02.090 --> 06:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
sorry about that it was my first time
 
06:26:03.890 --> 06:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
signing up and I missed the block on the
 
06:26:03.900 --> 06:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
signing up and I missed the block on the
Forum

06:26:05.750 --> 06:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
Forum
 
06:26:08.628 --> 06:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
and how long do you plan on testifying
 
06:26:10.970 --> 06:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
under five minutes but I probably know
 
06:26:12.948 --> 06:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
more about l-chip than anybody else on
 
06:26:15.048 --> 06:26:15.058 align:start position:0%
this call so I think what I have to say
 
06:26:19.670 --> 06:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:21.970 --> 06:26:21.980 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:26:24.650 --> 06:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
do the five minutes but I'm gonna cut
 
06:26:27.170 --> 06:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
you off at five I think that's fair you
 
06:26:28.970 --> 06:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
all have had an incredibly long day I
 
06:26:30.708 --> 06:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
listened in on the previous Bill and
 
06:26:32.570 --> 06:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
that was only one of many that you had
 
06:26:34.670 --> 06:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
sat through representative major and the
 
06:26:35.930 --> 06:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee thank you very
 
06:26:37.910 --> 06:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
much for hearing me and for the hard
 
06:26:39.770 --> 06:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
work that you put in every day to keep
 
06:26:41.330 --> 06:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
the state running as smoothly as
 
06:26:44.390 --> 06:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
possible I am digit Taylor I've been the
 
06:26:46.970 --> 06:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
executive director of L chips since 2010
 
06:26:48.830 --> 06:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
it is a great honor to serve the state
 
06:26:51.350 --> 06:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
in this capacity we think and we've been
 
06:26:52.850 --> 06:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
told repeatedly that we are one of the
 
06:26:54.590 --> 06:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
best functions that the state provides
 
06:26:56.270 --> 06:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
to the citizens
 
06:26:59.030 --> 06:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
LG was created in 2000 by the
 
06:27:00.708 --> 06:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
legislature with overwhelming support
 
06:27:03.350 --> 06:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
and its purpose is described in the
 
06:27:06.170 --> 06:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
first paragraph of the statute which Ms
 
06:27:08.330 --> 06:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
Vargas read to you recently
 
06:27:11.030 --> 06:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
um the we are intended to conserve and
 
06:27:13.010 --> 06:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
preserve important natural cultural
 
06:27:15.650 --> 06:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
historic resources through acquiring
 
06:27:18.110 --> 06:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
land or interest in lands and resources
 
06:27:20.330 --> 06:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
with matching grants and public private
 
06:27:22.490 --> 06:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
private Partnerships so the difference
 
06:27:24.288 --> 06:27:24.298 align:start position:0%
between what we do and what this
 
06:27:27.410 --> 06:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
proposal has is we acquire land and
 
06:27:29.208 --> 06:27:29.218 align:start position:0%
interest in lands and we do it through
 
06:27:31.310 --> 06:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
matching grants neither of which seems
 
06:27:33.048 --> 06:27:33.058 align:start position:0%
to be quite the case with this proposed
 
06:27:35.690 --> 06:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
legislation we have a long history of
 
06:27:37.548 --> 06:27:37.558 align:start position:0%
success I hope you have in front of you
 
06:27:39.708 --> 06:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
the beautifully colored handouts that I
 
06:27:41.628 --> 06:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
provided for you showing some examples
 
06:27:45.590 --> 06:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
of l-chip projects and listing listing
 
06:27:47.208 --> 06:27:47.218 align:start position:0%
the numbers of projects we've done and
 
06:27:48.890 --> 06:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
so forth but given the length of your
 
06:27:51.650 --> 06:27:51.660 align:start position:0%
day I will not try to read through all
 
06:27:54.170 --> 06:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:59.150 --> 06:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:59.160 --> 06:28:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:28:00.650 --> 06:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:03.230 --> 06:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
you probably want to know
 
06:28:05.750 --> 06:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
where our money comes from and all of
 
06:28:07.128 --> 06:28:07.138 align:start position:0%
the money that we give out in Grants
 
06:28:09.288 --> 06:28:09.298 align:start position:0%
comes from these fees that are are
 
06:28:11.150 --> 06:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
collected at the Registries of Deans
 
06:28:14.448 --> 06:28:14.458 align:start position:0%
this this was created in 2009 as a
 
06:28:16.430 --> 06:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund to support our grant
 
06:28:16.440 --> 06:28:17.810 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund to support our grant
making

06:28:17.810 --> 06:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
making
 
06:28:20.208 --> 06:28:20.218 align:start position:0%
um and these fees currently bring us in
 
06:28:22.010 --> 06:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
about three and a half to four million
 
06:28:24.530 --> 06:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
dollars a year the registry is as Ms
 
06:28:26.390 --> 06:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
Scott said get to keep five percent of
 
06:28:28.250 --> 06:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
that to cover their time and trouble in
 
06:28:30.470 --> 06:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
collecting the fees
 
06:28:32.570 --> 06:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
um and the estimates that are in the
 
06:28:34.430 --> 06:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note come largely from my
 
06:28:36.350 --> 06:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
estimates and
 
06:28:38.150 --> 06:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
um so the amount of money that l-chip
 
06:28:40.910 --> 06:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
would get if this were to be enacted
 
06:28:42.830 --> 06:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
would be less and we would be less able
 
06:28:42.840 --> 06:28:43.628 align:start position:0%
would be less and we would be less able
to

06:28:43.628 --> 06:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:28:46.190 --> 06:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
respond to the requests that we get for
 
06:28:48.410 --> 06:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
funding we already do not have enough
 
06:28:50.570 --> 06:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
money to meet the the requests that we
 
06:28:53.030 --> 06:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
get from applicants last year we
 
06:28:55.310 --> 06:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
received 65 applications looking for
 
06:28:58.070 --> 06:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
nearly nine million dollars in 2019
 
06:29:01.010 --> 06:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
there were 67 757 applications looking
 
06:29:02.990 --> 06:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
for seven and a half million dollars and
 
06:29:04.910 --> 06:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
we just the the three and a half to four
 
06:29:06.770 --> 06:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
million dollars just isn't enough so
 
06:29:09.470 --> 06:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
we're turning down really good projects
 
06:29:11.090 --> 06:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
simply because we don't have enough
 
06:29:11.100 --> 06:29:11.990 align:start position:0%
simply because we don't have enough
money

06:29:11.990 --> 06:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:29:14.390 --> 06:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
we agree that the archival restoration
 
06:29:16.010 --> 06:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
of the official land records is
 
06:29:18.170 --> 06:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
important to everyone who deals with
 
06:29:20.208 --> 06:29:20.218 align:start position:0%
real estate in transactions in the state
 
06:29:22.910 --> 06:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
not just to L ship however protecting
 
06:29:24.590 --> 06:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
them and preserving them is outside the
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
realm of what the legislature wisely
 
06:29:28.850 --> 06:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
created for l-chip to do
 
06:29:31.190 --> 06:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
it is of course up to the legislature to
 
06:29:33.410 --> 06:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
decide what to do with this bill but to
 
06:29:35.448 --> 06:29:35.458 align:start position:0%
me it doesn't make sense to give l-chip
 
06:29:38.448 --> 06:29:38.458 align:start position:0%
less money when we are all we're already
 
06:29:40.610 --> 06:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
flooded with requests for the money that
 
06:29:42.590 --> 06:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
we do have and the less money would be
 
06:29:45.048 --> 06:29:45.058 align:start position:0%
going to something that our program was
 
06:29:48.230 --> 06:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
not designed to protect
 
06:29:49.730 --> 06:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to answer
 
06:29:51.470 --> 06:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
questions if that is helpful and if you
 
06:29:54.590 --> 06:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:57.650 --> 06:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
that is great you only use three three
 
06:29:59.570 --> 06:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
minutes sofa
 
06:30:04.070 --> 06:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
our questions uh hold on one second okay
 
06:30:06.310 --> 06:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
give me the right to panelists
 
06:30:08.868 --> 06:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
represent Elmer
 
06:30:11.330 --> 06:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:30:14.270 --> 06:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
um we I'm on my Conservation Commission
 
06:30:17.110 --> 06:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
and I think we did manage to use
 
06:30:20.990 --> 06:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
partially l-chip once we do a lot more
 
06:30:24.170 --> 06:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
land acquisition than that because we've
 
06:30:29.030 --> 06:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
got a strong uh fund from our uh
 
06:30:32.510 --> 06:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
property current use property coming out
 
06:30:37.970 --> 06:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
into development but on my question was
 
06:30:40.730 --> 06:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
I've been under the impression that the
 
06:30:44.570 --> 06:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
local community has to raise about half
 
06:30:46.670 --> 06:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
the money ahead of time before they can
 
06:30:48.890 --> 06:30:48.900 align:start position:0%
apply for one of these so that they can
 
06:30:52.190 --> 06:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead with the project once they've
 
06:30:56.930 --> 06:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
got your part of it on and it's on
 
06:30:58.910 --> 06:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
considerable risk for them when you can
 
06:31:03.170 --> 06:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
only provide half of of the applicants
 
06:31:05.090 --> 06:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
with a grant
 
06:31:07.368 --> 06:31:07.378 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely you're absolutely right
 
06:31:09.530 --> 06:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
that we do require matching funds we
 
06:31:11.750 --> 06:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't require that it be in hand at the
 
06:31:13.610 --> 06:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
time of the application being submitted
 
06:31:16.010 --> 06:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
but a project that has that money in
 
06:31:18.110 --> 06:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
hand scores better than one that does
 
06:31:20.810 --> 06:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
not a more recent two more recent
 
06:31:22.788 --> 06:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
projects in Lebanon the Rogers house
 
06:31:26.750 --> 06:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
which is elderly housing and the um the
 
06:31:28.430 --> 06:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
music school the upper Upper Valley
 
06:31:30.590 --> 06:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
Music School across the across the Green
 
06:31:33.110 --> 06:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
from from the Rogers house so we have
 
06:31:34.670 --> 06:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
done some nice historic preservation
 
06:31:37.610 --> 06:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
projects in Lebanon as well
 
06:31:40.190 --> 06:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
yes I'd just like to add that Rogers
 
06:31:43.010 --> 06:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
house was the Rogers Hotel and I think
 
06:31:45.830 --> 06:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
dates back about 150 years and The
 
06:31:47.510 --> 06:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
Highwaymen and other things like that
 
06:31:50.170 --> 06:31:50.180 align:start position:0%
you had your own pirates in Lebanese
 
06:31:53.390 --> 06:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
elderly housing
 
06:31:56.510 --> 06:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh further questions of
 
06:32:00.170 --> 06:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:03.410 --> 06:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
06:32:05.830 --> 06:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening
 
06:32:08.930 --> 06:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
do we have anybody else
 
06:32:11.868 --> 06:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
there is one more hand raised
 
06:32:16.010 --> 06:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
not um signed up uh a actually there's
 
06:32:19.368 --> 06:32:19.378 align:start position:0%
two now a Matt Leahy and a Jeffrey

06:32:31.260 --> 06:32:32.810 align:start position:0%
 
oh

oh
 
06:32:37.128 --> 06:32:37.138 align:start position:0%
let's find out Matt Leahy okay I'm
 
06:32:40.128 --> 06:32:40.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:43.070 --> 06:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon Mr chairman I hope you
 
06:32:44.448 --> 06:32:44.458 align:start position:0%
all can hear me
 
06:32:47.750 --> 06:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
um Mr Leahy are you in support or
 
06:32:50.750 --> 06:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
opposition uh I am opposed to the bill
 
06:32:52.368 --> 06:32:52.378 align:start position:0%
and for the record
 
06:32:54.470 --> 06:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
um my name is Matt Leahy I work for the
 
06:32:58.128 --> 06:32:58.138 align:start position:0%
forest society and how long do you uh no
 
06:33:00.948 --> 06:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
more than two minutes I'll be very brief
 
06:33:03.288 --> 06:33:03.298 align:start position:0%
um and just you know for the record uh
 
06:33:05.150 --> 06:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
the four Society has received l-chip
 
06:33:07.250 --> 06:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
grants um in the past just so I just
 
06:33:10.128 --> 06:33:10.138 align:start position:0%
want the community to know that but as I
 
06:33:12.350 --> 06:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
said we are opposed to the bill and
 
06:33:14.150 --> 06:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
although we you know we do understand
 
06:33:17.470 --> 06:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
the importance you know to the counties
 
06:33:20.628 --> 06:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
maybe lean into your microphone
 
06:33:24.048 --> 06:33:24.058 align:start position:0%
is this better yes okay yeah so we do
 
06:33:25.730 --> 06:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
understand the importance to the
 
06:33:27.410 --> 06:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
counties too
 
06:33:29.270 --> 06:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
um you know undertake this repair and
 
06:33:32.448 --> 06:33:32.458 align:start position:0%
archival work our concern is though that
 
06:33:35.330 --> 06:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
this work is going to be coming
 
06:33:38.330 --> 06:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
um or or at places at least part of the
 
06:33:41.628 --> 06:33:41.638 align:start position:0%
burden on l-chip to undertake
 
06:33:44.810 --> 06:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
um and I would just point out one thing
 
06:33:44.820 --> 06:33:46.310 align:start position:0%
um and I would just point out one thing
that

06:33:46.310 --> 06:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:33:49.610 --> 06:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
um you know State Statute at 478 colon 1
 
06:33:51.890 --> 06:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
actually puts the responsibility for
 
06:33:55.090 --> 06:33:55.100 align:start position:0%
this type of work on the counties not on
 
06:33:58.490 --> 06:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
Belcher and as digit mentioned
 
06:34:00.830 --> 06:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
um you know this you know taking this
 
06:34:03.288 --> 06:34:03.298 align:start position:0%
additional money from l-chip's budget
 
06:34:04.548 --> 06:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
will something
 
06:34:06.350 --> 06:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
um you know put more pressure on l-ship
 
06:34:08.750 --> 06:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
to carry out its Mission and to try to
 
06:34:11.690 --> 06:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
meet the demand for its programs and so
 
06:34:13.788 --> 06:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
again we are opposed to the bill
 
06:34:15.590 --> 06:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you for your
 
06:34:17.570 --> 06:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr lady
 
06:34:17.580 --> 06:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr lady
questions

06:34:18.720 --> 06:34:18.730 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:34:18.730 --> 06:34:20.270 align:start position:0%
questions
[Music]

06:34:20.270 --> 06:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:34:22.730 --> 06:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
switch over here
 
06:34:25.128 --> 06:34:25.138 align:start position:0%
I don't see any questions so the next
 
06:34:28.788 --> 06:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
one is Mr chairman I believe that Jeff
 
06:34:30.650 --> 06:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
Gilbert is the Jeff Gilbert that was
 
06:34:33.708 --> 06:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
your Vice chair a long time ago oh I'm
 
06:34:37.250 --> 06:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
ready to bring them in right now
 
06:34:39.410 --> 06:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
but I mean
 
06:34:44.208 --> 06:34:44.218 align:start position:0%
Jeff Gilbert I don't know he said I I
 
06:34:45.890 --> 06:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
hope you folks can hear me first of all
 
06:34:47.868 --> 06:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
it's a privilege to come before this
 
06:34:50.150 --> 06:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee again and representative Olney
 
06:34:51.350 --> 06:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
06:34:54.470 --> 06:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
um I served uh under the uh leadership
 
06:34:58.070 --> 06:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
of uh chairman Majors uh quite some
 
06:35:01.548 --> 06:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
years ago uh as Vice chair and greatly
 
06:35:03.770 --> 06:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
enjoyed my opportunity to work with you
 
06:35:06.830 --> 06:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
folks and and in particular of course uh
 
06:35:09.350 --> 06:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
have been a long time champion of el
 
06:35:12.530 --> 06:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
chip uh and also as representative Omni
 
06:35:14.628 --> 06:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
specifically knows have taken a strong
 
06:35:16.610 --> 06:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
interest in dedicated funds and
 
06:35:19.670 --> 06:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds being used properly for
 
06:35:21.048 --> 06:35:21.058 align:start position:0%
the purposes for which they were
 
06:35:24.110 --> 06:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated in the initial instance and uh
 
06:35:26.690 --> 06:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh also with full disclosure of what the
 
06:35:29.750 --> 06:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
funds do I'm appearing here the the this
 
06:35:31.190 --> 06:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
06:35:33.590 --> 06:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
preservation Alliance of which I am a
 
06:35:36.470 --> 06:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
trustee uh and we urge the rejection of
 
06:35:40.548 --> 06:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
House Bill 621 which as you you all have
 
06:35:43.548 --> 06:35:43.558 align:start position:0%
heard a great deal of testimony about is
 
06:35:46.250 --> 06:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
diverting funds from this program uh for
 
06:35:48.410 --> 06:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
other purposes which are not uh those
 
06:35:50.830 --> 06:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
that are Central to the program itself
 
06:35:53.810 --> 06:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh there's been certainly much testimony
 
06:35:56.090 --> 06:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
so I'll try not to take very long but to
 
06:35:58.910 --> 06:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
just emphasize a couple of points uh the
 
06:36:01.250 --> 06:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund was originally conceived
 
06:36:04.970 --> 06:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
as one which had Nexus uh to the
 
06:36:07.490 --> 06:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
purposes of l-chip the source of funding
 
06:36:10.310 --> 06:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
in fact uh makes a great deal of sense
 
06:36:13.128 --> 06:36:13.138 align:start position:0%
when you consider that l-chips programs
 
06:36:15.410 --> 06:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
indeed contribute significantly to the
 
06:36:18.230 --> 06:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
quality of life in New Hampshire and
 
06:36:20.868 --> 06:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
enhance as a result of that not only the
 
06:36:22.850 --> 06:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of our citizens of so many of
 
06:36:25.610 --> 06:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
our resources both be they land or be
 
06:36:27.830 --> 06:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
they cultural or be the historic but it
 
06:36:29.750 --> 06:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
also raises property values in the
 
06:36:29.760 --> 06:36:30.548 align:start position:0%
also raises property values in the
process

06:36:30.548 --> 06:36:30.558 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:36:34.610 --> 06:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
and one of the key things that are two
 
06:36:37.670 --> 06:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
key points I'd like to re-emphasize the
 
06:36:39.490 --> 06:36:39.500 align:start position:0%
program has been under has been
 
06:36:42.048 --> 06:36:42.058 align:start position:0%
oversubscribed and underfunded for many
 
06:36:44.810 --> 06:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
many years this is a program which
 
06:36:47.150 --> 06:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
historically as I believe Digi Taylor
 
06:36:50.990 --> 06:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
testified uh has nearly two or two and a
 
06:36:53.570 --> 06:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
half times the demand with quality
 
06:36:56.930 --> 06:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
projects uh that simply uh can't be
 
06:37:00.288 --> 06:37:00.298 align:start position:0%
funded so any diversion of funds from
 
06:37:03.530 --> 06:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
this uh purpose would be a significant
 
06:37:06.770 --> 06:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
dilution of its great uh goals and
 
06:37:09.650 --> 06:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
objectives which I think have truly been
 
06:37:11.570 --> 06:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
remarkable in what they've done for the
 
06:37:14.150 --> 06:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
state over the 20 years of the program
 
06:37:16.510 --> 06:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
one element that is particularly
 
06:37:19.610 --> 06:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
significant is that often l-chip funds
 
06:37:23.030 --> 06:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
serve as the critical Equity component
 
06:37:26.930 --> 06:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
for a project because it is a grant and
 
06:37:30.830 --> 06:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
as a grant uh often is essential to add
 
06:37:33.650 --> 06:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
to other sources of funding as I think
 
06:37:36.410 --> 06:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
digit testified almost all the projects
 
06:37:38.750 --> 06:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
require significant additional funding
 
06:37:42.470 --> 06:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
and l-chip achieves that ability to
 
06:37:44.810 --> 06:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
leverage that that funding whether it's
 
06:37:46.730 --> 06:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
from Bank sources or whether it's from
 
06:37:49.490 --> 06:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
Community uh funds that are raised
 
06:37:53.090 --> 06:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
otherwise so it it produces a five or
 
06:37:55.610 --> 06:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
six to one benefit to the communities
 
06:37:59.330 --> 06:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
that that the projects are located in uh
 
06:38:02.448 --> 06:38:02.458 align:start position:0%
and makes the community stronger creates
 
06:38:05.750 --> 06:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
additional uh community support and
 
06:38:08.090 --> 06:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
overall I think improves our quality of
 
06:38:11.030 --> 06:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
life I certainly hope that you do uh
 
06:38:14.150 --> 06:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
take the step in itl the bill uh l-chip
 
06:38:15.948 --> 06:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
if anything needs considerably more
 
06:38:17.510 --> 06:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
funding not less
 
06:38:20.090 --> 06:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any questions
 
06:38:25.208 --> 06:38:25.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:27.190 --> 06:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative Brantley has a question
 
06:38:30.350 --> 06:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um Mr Gilbert thank you for
 
06:38:31.670 --> 06:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
06:38:35.030 --> 06:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
so being being a state rep for a while
 
06:38:36.830 --> 06:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
there you you probably had a chance to
 
06:38:38.628 --> 06:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
observe County Government
 
06:38:40.250 --> 06:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
and I think it was mentioned earlier
 
06:38:43.010 --> 06:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
that most Registries of Deeds generate
 
06:38:44.628 --> 06:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
more Revenue
 
06:38:47.390 --> 06:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
than they their expense therefore the
 
06:38:49.910 --> 06:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
counties use the excess for other things
 
06:38:51.410 --> 06:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
within the county
 
06:38:54.170 --> 06:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
is that is that your observation as well
 
06:38:56.390 --> 06:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
that that is generally my understanding
 
06:38:59.510 --> 06:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
and and uh not speaking to the merits or
 
06:39:01.850 --> 06:39:01.860 align:start position:0%
demerits of preserving the records which
 
06:39:03.708 --> 06:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
I think is a lofty goal it's just this
 
06:39:05.208 --> 06:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the source of funding for
 
06:39:07.490 --> 06:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
that goal the county uh has other
 
06:39:10.788 --> 06:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
resources available to it uh which some
 
06:39:12.830 --> 06:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
of which could be short-term uh such as
 
06:39:15.948 --> 06:39:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh the typical uh annual funds but also
 
06:39:18.350 --> 06:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
long term in terms of bonding uh the
 
06:39:20.330 --> 06:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
comments were made today bonding is at a
 
06:39:23.150 --> 06:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
extraordinary low cost for uh for for
 
06:39:25.850 --> 06:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
the counties which could be utilized uh
 
06:39:28.490 --> 06:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
very readily for this purpose uh and not
 
06:39:31.730 --> 06:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh be deluding uh the the other enormous
 
06:39:36.110 --> 06:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
benefits that l-chip brings thank you
 
06:39:39.590 --> 06:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Mr The Honorable
 
06:39:43.368 --> 06:39:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:48.830 --> 06:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:50.570 --> 06:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
any further
 
06:39:54.948 --> 06:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
people wish to testify for or against
 
06:39:57.830 --> 06:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 621.
 
06:40:00.110 --> 06:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
if not I'm going to close the hearing on
