they weren't prepared to come for and
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
they would be here this time I don't see
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
them here this time
 
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
we have been waiting for information
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
from them and we've been waiting for for
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
requests from them about changes that
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislation could be made to make to
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
make it more effective in terms of
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with the problem uh that's not
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
happened and uh that bothers me and uh
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm very concerned about that I'm
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the settlements I'm
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the people that are
 
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
involved uh and I and we've we've seen a
 
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
number of stories in the news about that
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
so I I want to voice my real concern
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
about the fact that nobody's coming
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I have the
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
same concerns I'm told that they have
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
quarterly reporting requirements and the
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
quarter will be in November so they will
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
certainly appear
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
then they will be told that we're
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
waiting for these answers but it will be
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
business then moving on the consent

289 and
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh 289 290 293 all similar
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
topics and representative Edwards is
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
recognize to begin the question uh uh
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um these three are
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
are bundled together um because they're
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
similar in many ways these are uh
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
federal funds the state is accepting to
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
to uh assist with uh a refugee program
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
um my my my uh thoughts around this are
 
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.949 align:start position:0%
um my my my uh thoughts around this are
that

00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
um in the last couple years we've had
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
7.5 million people come across the
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
southern border that's five times the
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh many of them
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
have been going to Massachusetts uh the
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
governor there has declared that their
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
housing stock uh is overwhelmed and they
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
may no longer be able to um support
 
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
their law that says that everyone shall
 
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.189 align:start position:0%
their law that says that everyone shall
be

00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
homed uh and as a result I'm I I think
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's just reasonable given the proximity
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
for us to begin
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
anticipating what's going to happen if
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh if uh New Hampshire starts to get a
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
significant number of U of refugees and
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm really asking
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh a question of the department about
 
00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
the extent to which we are engaged uh
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
with um uh I I don't know if it's
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security I'm not sure which
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
federal agency is managing uh the inflow
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
of of uh the 7.5 million people but um I
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
I uh could you could you talk to us
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
about what you perceive the risk is I
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
use risk not as a threatening term but
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
just as a management term you know
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
looking at things that may affect us
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
could you could you tell us what sort of
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
thought process is being put into um how
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
many new people may be showing up within
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire in the coming
 
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
budget year budget cycle till June of 25
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
and uh what sort of thought is being put
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
into it now in terms of um what sort of
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
demand it'll put on General funds or
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
given our Workforce shortages what it
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
may mean to our ability to support U New
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
citizens good morning Nathan white Chief
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer I I I think to start I
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
don't know if we came prepared to answer
 
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
such an expansive question um because
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
that has many uh assumptions unknowns
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
and demographic indicators that I don't
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily have available with me today
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
um I I can I can hand it over to uh
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
Ruben Hampton who is the office of
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
Health Equity director to provide
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
insight into the specifics of these
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
items but I I don't know representative
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
Edwards if I can really give uh a a a
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
cogent answer precisely without doing a
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
fair amount of research and response to
 
00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:51.949 align:start position:0%
fair amount of research and response to
that

00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
question uh so this is similar to the
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions I had asked during the budget
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
process with the standard house budget
 
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
process and so I don't I don't think I'm
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
laying a surprise on you that I have a
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
continued interest given that the issue
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
is is just continuing to uh expand in
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
its potential impact on the state uh I I
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
I just don't want to be standing here in
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
six months to nine
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
months uh with a with an enormous Bill
 
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
put on us and um and and and and to have
 
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
put on us and um and and and and to have
an

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
exacerbation Workforce shortages and
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
housing shortages and the like I'm just
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
not I I I just would like us to get
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
ahead and anticipate the chaos that
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
could could come from enormous numbers
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
moving into the state so um so if
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
there's not an answer
 
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
today uh I I will have a continuing
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
interest in this and let's continue to
 
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
have the conversation because you know
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
no no surprise is a good surprise in
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
this case and and I'd love to hear from
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh your last name or first name is
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
Ruben yes good morning uh Ruben Hampton
 
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
director of The Office of Health
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
Equity I think I remember meeting you
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
when you were first brand new right and
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
it's it's been almost a year now about
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
nine months yes we met at the budget
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
hearing great what do you have to share
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
with us so uh representative Edwards the
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
refugee program uh serves those who have
 
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
are or our eligible population so it
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
would not be any of those folks who you
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
know would come over it would be all
 
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
those who had been vetted prior to
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
entering the United States right they
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
would have been granted this status
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
few so I think I like that answer but
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
just to really pin it down to make sure
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
I understand it those people are coming
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
across the border and claiming Asylum
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
are they categorized also as
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
refugees so they are not
 
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
refugees those who have been granted
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
Asylum would be ases and would be
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
considered an O eligible population but
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
they would have to have been granted
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
Asylum if they sought Asylum and not
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
been granted it they are not considered
 
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
or eligible and they would not be served
 
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
by this
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
program okay so just to nail it um so in
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
these two or these three requests for um
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
accepting of federal funds these are
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
these programs are are not really open
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
to those who have filed an asylum claim
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
but have not yet been adjudicated they
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
are not eligible for these programs they
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
are not eligible and some of these funds
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
are for specific populations that
 
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be for those folks anyway like
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
some of these funds are for those who
 
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
are you know Ukrainian right and other
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
specific popul populations but yes to
 
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
your point representative Edwards if
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
they have not been approved for Asylum
 
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
they would not be an O eligible
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
population it would not be eligible for
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh the benefits that that's outstanding
 
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
situational awareness that calms my
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
fears about a flood that we can't afford
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
you Mo the item
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
second do want to move all three
 
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
Senator gray um that's my question I
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
think that since they were on the
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
consent since we've taken them you know
 
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony individually if the chair
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
will allow I will move all three of them
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
89 uh 29 289 290 and 293 second and a
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
second motion and a second Senator gray
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
and Senator rosenal further discussion
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
on these we'll be ready next time with
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
with more answers uh all in favor say I
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
I oppose no the motion is adopted the
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
next one I have on removal is uh item
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.789 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
all right first we represent we'll
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Edwards for a
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
question all right uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
um the my question about this is that we
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
have a rebalancing demonstration program
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
and it says very specifically in the
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
final sentence that if federal funds no
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
longer are available General funds will
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
not be requested
 
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
and I always wonder about these if if if
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
if this is likely to be a successful
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
demo uh what would we do would are we
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
really prepared to wrap it up and shut
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
it down if it's successful or might it
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
find its way into a future budget I I I
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I'm clear on
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not we we say this out of
 
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559 align:start position:0%
habit or if we really mean it are we
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
really not going to ask for General
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
funds um good morning I'm Melissa Hardy
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
I'm the division director for long-term
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
supports and services thank you
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative adward for the question
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
um you know I think from a I can talk
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
from the programmatic standpoint we've
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
had a program like this in New Hampshire
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
before um probably six or seven years
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
ago called Community passport program um
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
what we anticipate is that the federal
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
government will continue to fund money
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
falls the person there hasn't been any
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
indication um that this will not be
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
funded through the feds um and since it
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
has been an ongoing historic program
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
that they have funded um if if it is
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
something that's successful that keeps
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
individuals and uh into the community
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
rather than in in institutional care I
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
think we would certainly have a
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
conversation about how um if the federal
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
funds stop how we would um have a cost
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
Savings in New Hampshire and looking
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
into budgeting that but but at this
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
point in time it's our understanding
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
that those federal funds would continue
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
to come which is why we included that
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
statement that's that statement is based
 
00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
on the best possible knowledge that we
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
have available
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
today thank you Mr chair I I I I just
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
being a purist it sounds like we're not
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
really saying General funds will not be
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
requested we're saying that at this time
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
no General funds are anticipated to be
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
requested and and I don't know if this
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
language is just boilerplate or or in
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
law or something but I I just like
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
Clarity because these documents speak to
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
the public as well I just want to make
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
sure the state is saying what it really
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
thinks I think for this particular item
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
we um are assured through the Feds that
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
we will get this amount so what we're
 
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
requesting um will be federally funded
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
um beyond that I I think that would be
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative f for a
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
you for taking the questions I actually
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
have two questions if that's okay okay
 
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
what are the historically underserved
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
communities requiring Equitable
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
Care thank you um we had to identify
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
that in our application for money falls
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
the person uh based on some CMS
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines that we had so that typically
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
includes um individuals in rural
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
communities who have um access concerns
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
to Services just due to um their
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
geographic location also folks that may
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
have some language barriers um in
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
accessing or applying for uh benefits
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
through the Money Follows the person
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
program it could be perhaps folks from
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
diverse backgrounds that uh may not be
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with what's available out for
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
Service delivery and also folks who
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
struggle maybe just accessing um the
 
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
system itself so it could be folks who
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't have internet access or
 
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation barriers to actually
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
apply for services thank you followup
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
followup so separate question not really
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
a followup um when will the system
 
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
assessment and GAP analysis start
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
becoming available and where could we
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
find it when it does yes so we're
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
currently working with a stakeholder
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
group um we did um we are Contracting
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
with a provider to work with that group
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
um the timing of that I don't know if I
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
have that right in front of me
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
um I will have to get that too I don't
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
have that timing in front of me but I
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
can do that we're currently working on
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
that with our stakeholders thank you
 
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
senator rosenal for a
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman good
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
morning I understand that this is going
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
to be somewhat different from the
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
community passport program but my
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
question is how are you going to define
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
success this time sure what is it look
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
like is it saving money because
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
somebody's not in a nursing home or is
 
00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:28.950 align:start position:0%
somebody's not in a nursing home or is
it

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
individual satisfaction or ability
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
to get the services
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
they're uh prove for or sure I think I
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
think you hit I think you hit it on the
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
head on a couple of those areas so part
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
of the mfp program is doing satisfaction
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
surveys which we historically um have
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
not done um on the Aging side of of our
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
business so that's part of this program
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
passport which is the previous iteration
 
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
of money follows a person really focused
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
on transitioning folks out of nursing
 
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
homes into the community and for this
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
program we're really looking at how
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're keeping people into the in the
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
community versus um them going into
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
institutional care so it's kind of a
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of a swap of thinking and
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
taking PE from before from taking people
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
out of the nursing home into the
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
community but now we're really looking
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
to strengthen the community service to
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
keep people in the community so I think
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
those are a couple of our measures as
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
you as you
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned the question thank you so
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're uh we have an informational item
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
before us today on the Medicaid rate
 
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
increases and my understanding is the
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
CFI rates are going to go up about
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
30% won't that by itself go a long way
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
towards guaranteeing that the workforce
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
and therefore the
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
services are available what what else
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
are you looking to do yeah sure I think
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
I think that certainly is a is a large
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
help on the CFI Community but there's a
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
lot of people living in the community
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
that cannot access access CFI whether
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
that's because they don't meet um the
 
00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
medical level of care or they don't meet
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid level of care to um get
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
waiver services so there's some there's
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
a population of folks in the community
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
that receive services such as meals
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
transportation that are not that is not
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
funded by Medicaid um so we're they're
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
funded by their Grant programs um so we
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
certainly um appreciate um the historic
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
budget that was passed and um we know
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
our stakeholders are certainly um very
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
excited on the CFI uh rate increases but
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
there are also folks that can't access
 
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
CFI just either because of their
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
status further questions from committee
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.070 align:start position:0%
 
motion

00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%

motion and a second to adopt the item
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
any further discussion seeing none all

00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
eight I'll recognize uh somebody from
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%

Senator

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
rosenal thank
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman I just um from
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
The Narrative did not understand what
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
this item was
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
doing you want to open
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
it so um I'll speak to the the financial
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
side of it and then I will hand it over
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
to Melissa to speak to the programmatic
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
aspect um there there's there's two
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
technical requested actions here one is
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
transferring funds um and you will see
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
that transfer where we're moving it from
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
the payments to Providers to the
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
contract line into 102 and the reason
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
that we're doing that is because there's
 
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
been changes in the plan and um the
 
00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:16.519 align:start position:0%
other aspect of this is the acceptance
 
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
of the of the enhanced uh dollars into
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
the budget this year um as many of you
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
may recall we did not include many of
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
the federal pandemic uh any of the
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
federal pandemic doar in the state
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
budget we've already accepted various
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
arpa funds earlier I think it was in
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
June um where the fiscal committee
 
00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:36.039 align:start position:0%
accepted those funds and that's why
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
you're seeing that acceptance being
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
brought here now um and I will hand it
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
over to Melissa to speak to the program
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
yes so as we do our quarterly reporting
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
to CMS on our spending plan um as Nathan
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're able to refine some of
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
the financial aspects so moving those
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
dollars into contracts so over the past
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
quarter we've been able to fund some
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
contracts um that have been approved
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
through GNC such as um you know 111 beds
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
for folks with intensive treatment
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
service needs to uh buy property or
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
refurbish property so they can live into
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
the community um also we've uh been able
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
to uh uh award 27 grants as far as uh
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce retention and recruitment so
 
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
about $16.3 million to Home and
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
Community Based providers for uh
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
Workforce and recruitment strategies has
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
not been yet approved by GNC but we are
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
currently in the um final stages of that
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
RGA process so um it it's fluid every
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
quarter as we give our um update to CMS
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
as far as how we are able to contract
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
out the dollars for our Arbor spending
 
00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:45.799 align:start position:0%
plan further question thank you just a
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
quick followup so we've lapsed some of
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
this additional F FMA over the last
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
couple of years are we actually going to
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
spend this money we're not not going to
 
00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.789 align:start position:0%
spend this money we're not not going to
lapse

00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
it um I I I do know that the team is
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
working diligently to move forward um
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
you know oftentimes we do have
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
challenges with Contracting sometimes
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
our contracts don't get through
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes they get tabled and voted down
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
which just happened yesterday um for one
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
of our items so we work as hard as we
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
can to get these dollars out the door as
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
part of the pro as part of the plan that
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
Melissa's teams work with CMS um we
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't intend to to have any dollars laps
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
but sometimes there are variables that
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
are outside of our control thank you of
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
course Senator Pearl for a
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you is any of this money
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
being spent to alleviate the situation
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's going on in our Hospitals now
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
where we've got essentially long-term
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
care patients that are stuck there
 
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
because they can't get placements
 
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.470 align:start position:0%
because they can't get placements
anywhere

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
else I would say that you know all of
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
this all of these funds are focused on
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
Home and Community Based Services and
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's certainly um a population of
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
folks that we know um whether they could
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
get um Services through CFI or other
 
00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
Home and Community Based access services
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
that that would help that flow from the
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
hospital either back into the community
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
um we know that our community based
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
providers are struggling with Staffing
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
and that sometimes is a reason why we
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
cannot coordinate services from the
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
hospital to the community so we feel
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
that these dollars since they are um
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
communitybased focused will help um some
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
of that boarding in hospitals um we also
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
know um you know Staffing and nursing
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
homes is is is tough as well so some
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
people um as Staffing changes in nursing
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
homes um you know that helps move people
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
out of the hospital and step them down
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
into that level of care although nursing
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
homes aren't covered um in in this uh
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
ARA spending because they're not
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
considered Home and Community Based
 
00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:47.549 align:start position:0%
considered Home and Community Based
thank

00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:47.559 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
you representative f for a question uh
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
confirm something I think I heard I may
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
have heard it wrong um first of all I
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
was was told this was a 10% fmap um as
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
opposed to the sort of standard 6 and a
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
half% and then was something you
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually had to apply for to get as
 
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to the other fmap stuff which
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
was sort of Auto just coming on is that
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
is that am I did I misunderstand those
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
points you're referring to the enhanced
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
6.2% I'm sorry versus yes versus this
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
one involved in the initial application
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
director liman has some input we put the
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
tables down there so we don't have to
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
play music chair
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
yeah director if you want to sit at one
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
of those those side chairs and use one
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
mics director Lipman has something to
 
00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
add thank you for the question
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
representative or if you're correct this
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
was the 10% and we did have to um
 
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:54.519 align:start position:0%
demonstrate uh that as uh Melissa was
 
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
saying there C only certain Services
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
were qualifi for the 10% and so we had
 
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
to put together a plan as well as a of
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to do we also had a
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
develop a methodology for claiming that
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
had to be approved it was a multi-step
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
process versus the 6.2% that you're more
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with was sort of automatic
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much you're
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
welcome Senator Bradley for a question
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much good morning so
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
how does this funding intersect with
 
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
what we did in the budget in
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
particular uh the Senate Bill 36
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
care so I would say um for for this arpa
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
funding it it's a separate funding
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
stream than what was uh approved for 30
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
for Senate Bill 36 but um certainly they
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
intersect with each other as it both are
 
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
focused on keeping folks into the in the
 
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.669 align:start position:0%
focused on keeping folks into the in the
community

00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
um so there are some places where it
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
will overlap as far as I think
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
especially the recruiting and retention
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
dollars um to help support that system
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
of care for healthy
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
aging and these yeah thank you Mr chair
 
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
sorry um these funds would
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
um not be able to be used
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
for uh raate increases for providers is
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
that correct it's just for the four
 
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.869 align:start position:0%
that correct it's just for the four
things

00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
outlined that is correct yes
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you director Lipman
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%

add no I'm I'm all set thank
 
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
you second okay motion to accept item
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%

um Senator rosenal second by Senator
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
Bradley is there any further discussion
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
on the item seeing none you're ready for
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
the question all in favor say I I no
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
that item is adopted moving on to items
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
294 and
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
295 taken together that they're both
 
00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.190 align:start position:0%
295 taken together that they're both
about

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines and I
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
guess Senator Edwards and Senator F both
 
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
have questions on those who's ready
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
first Senator Edwards representative
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh representative Edwards yes
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
I I have had an ongoing concern about uh
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
the acceptance of of money and the
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
expenditure of money to have the state
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
basically put in a position where it
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
appears as though uh we are certifying
 
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.990 align:start position:0%
appears as though uh we are certifying
or

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
endorsing um childhood vaccinations of
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
the coid
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
vac and uh I
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
I would like to know um to what extent
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
you think
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
294 and and maybe
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
295 are going to end up spending money
 
00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
to try to Market or make available the
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
um so this is internal operations this
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
isn't any sort of shots on Wheels
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
getting it out to the public or schools
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
this is all just basically uh
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
administrative management within the
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
department uh in infrastructure uh
 
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
technology and then um uh yeah
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
operational uh cost so the uh the
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
sources from the federal government on
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
this actually prohibits us from doing
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
direct purchase of vaccine so we
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be purchasing any vaccines with
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
these funds and final followup followup
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
okay are you are you a physician or
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
clinician yeah I'm a registered
 
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in Hampshire so uh are you
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
aware of any sort of definitive set of
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
clinical studies that have determined
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
the efficacy and safety of the coid shot
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
for otherwise healthy children under the
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
age of
 
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
18 uh
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
so you know I do have some uh other
 
00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
information that I'd be happy to share I
 
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
work closely with uh our state
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist Dr Benjamin Chan on this
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
um you know as we know with any vaccine
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's flu or pneumonia there are
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
ongoing studies to look at advocacy U
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
you know so most related probably to the
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
flu we know each year that um the E
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
efficacy so I'm specifically interested
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
in Co and so it's kind of yes or no you
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
you are aware or you are not aware of
 
00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:40.839 align:start position:0%
any good set of clinical studies to
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
indicate the safety and efficacy of the
 
00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
coid shot for children under the age of
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
18 representative Edwards I believe we
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
had provided um Dr Chin had provided an
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
item with a write up of the various
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
studies on this topic I I I can see if I
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
can dig into it uh it probably was last
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
year I think we had provided some kind
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
of write up where we included like 100
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
different studies or something like that
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
on this question so so my question I
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
think got it buried in the Avalanche of
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
studies I just would like the very
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
specific studies related to safety and
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
efficacy under the age of 18 period sure
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
yep so Dr Chan had provided that science
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
brief uh as uh Mr did have another
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
person that wishes to comment and
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
identify yourself
 
00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:34.839 align:start position:0%
first hey good morning uh my name is Ian
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
wad I'm the deputy director for public
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
health so as Nathan mentioned we did
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
provide a number of scientific studies
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
um provided both by by academics as well
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
as uh Federal and and state resources be
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
more than happy to provide those uh
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
again to to the uh the fiscal committee
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh I would focus the question that you
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
know ultimately our our vaccine for
 
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
children program and the state will only
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
provide uh vaccines and and support
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are federally approved
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
that have been approved uh through
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
various scientific boards as well as
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
medical boards um and we that has been
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
our Legacy policy that continues to be
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
our policy to approve things that have
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
been scientifically approved uh and the
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
co vaccine does does qualify under those
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
criteria all right so I understand that
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
there are boards that are positioned to
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
be viewed as SCI ific boards but I'm not
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
convinced that they've been following
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
the science in terms of making sure that
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
these Pro these vaccines are safe and
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
efficacious for this particular
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
demographic and I'm concerned that we're
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
not doing a very good job of advertising
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
the risks associated with it and the
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
unknown part of of the long-term effects
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
of it so so so so please don't give me
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what was given by Dr Chen last
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
time I'm very specific around studies
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
that demonstrate the efficacy and safety
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 and so maybe there
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
are new studies because it's been nine
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
months since I last asked but um so so
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I just really think it's
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
important that we protect our children
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not sure that this program
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
the coid vaccines really do so and
 
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
critical to the conversation we have
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
around vaccine in the department is the
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
conversation between an individual
 
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
parents uh and children and their PCP so
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
certainly we require that the people
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
consult with their primary care
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
physician who are evaluating individuals
 
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances and any
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
concerns of parents they may have and
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
certainly rely on the the medical
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
community and providers to be well
 
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
informed and and have a dynamic
 
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
conversation with their patients about
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
what's what's needed and and required
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative f for a question uh thank
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair actually my question is not
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
related to these two fiscal notes but it
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
is related to vaccines um the co vaccine
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
in particular you've probably seen in
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
the news I hope I have that nursing
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
homes are having a difficult time
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
getting the co 19 vaccine and yet it is
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
generally available in pharmacies for
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
non nsing home populations and the
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
federal government apparently there
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
something to do with that I'm just
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
wondering is there anything the state
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
problem another person that wants to
 
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.349 align:start position:0%
problem another person that wants to
have

00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
input sure yeah so as we know uh the co
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
19 vaccines have since been
 
00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
commercialized um so that has kind of um
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
changed or reverted back to the normal
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
supply chain process for healthcare
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
providers including long-term care
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
facilities to acquire the vaccine um and
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
you know we have been seeing that in the
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
news and we're soliciting feedback from
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh providers and long-term care
 
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
facilities to see what any type of
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
support that we may be able to help them
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
with so you are looking into and trying
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
to help them out is that what you're is
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
that the bottom line of what you just
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
said the
 
00:42:59.069 --> 00:42:59.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
295 okay Senator gray moves the two
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
items and Senator rosenal seconds before
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
we leave it I have one more question I
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
want to be reassured on the record that
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
these shots will not be forced on our
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
children by putting them in the required
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
list of shots before they can enter
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
school that's correct um we've provided
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh testimony for a number of pieces of
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
legislation staying that we do not um we
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
are not at all looking to add the co 19
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine to the school or Child Care
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
requirements thank you further
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on this item seeing none
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
ready for the question all in favor say
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
I I oppose no no okay you wish to be
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
recorded all right two items are adopted
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
with one negative vote now moving on to
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
tab nine the regular calendar
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
the item is
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation there questions on the
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
members a motion to move the item by
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative leean second by Senator
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
dallesandro is there any further
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor say
 
00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to item I guess that was
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
the last one but we have some
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous items that may have there
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
may be questions
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
on um I believe we have one on
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:02.430 align:start position:0%
 
Courts

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
someone indicated there would be a
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
question now I don't remember who was it
 
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
rep representative Edwards I my only
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
note to myself is I have a a question
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
about 312 on the informational materials
 
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
then okay these are just information we
 
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
don't need any uh any motion to accept
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
them Senator rosenal I also had a
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
question on the HHS
 
00:45:36.549 --> 00:45:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
36 so I guess we're back to thank you
 
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
very much I thought we had a question on
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
that one I had a note there when we had
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
earlier discussions so we're back to
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
health and human
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
services and I see item
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
23311 I had a note that represent Earth
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
had a question J the Das before before
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's the dashboard which one 306 306
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
we go to 306 first and Senator rosenell
 
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
has a question on thank you
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
um just my questions have to do with
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
what is going on at Hampstead
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
Hospital uh there was just an article in
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
the nashwa telegraph this morning that
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
the police Le local and state have been
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
called 130 times in the
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
last little bit over a year for issues
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
ranging from physical assault to sexual
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
assault and that the their are questions
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
about the contractor we had been told
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
back in when did we visit Hamstead as a
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
committee May June
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
April that the contract was abouted to
 
00:47:03.069 --> 00:47:03.079 align:start position:0%
be rebid but now it looks like it hasn't
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
been yet I know the department has
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
changed the management team which is the
 
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
only state employees but they're not the
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
ones who are
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
providing clinical
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
or other Direct Services to children and
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
I see that despite the promises of
 
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
wellpath to increase the number of beds
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
we still where we were when we bought
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
the place so I'm hoping that you have
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
news for us on how we're going to
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
make Care at Hamstead more
 
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
available and
 
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:52.839 align:start position:0%
safer and better sure thank you so
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
probably not a question for Nathan I I I
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
can provide some detail though on on the
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
contract in the RFP Ju Just to start so
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
so we had gone out to bid for that
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
contract which expires in June um and we
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
ended up cancelling that and I'm not
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
disclosed as to say why there's a state
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
law that actually prohibits it um but we
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be reposting that here in
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
the next month so expect to see a new
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
RFP posted in November on that topic um
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
and do you want to take it
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
hi good morning an leandry associate
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner um thank you so much for
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
your question and your concern and I
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
honestly wish I had more information for
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
you today than was shared yesterday at
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
the council meeting and unfortunately
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner weer and Associate
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner hen who are very involved
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
um with Hamstead and the the leadership
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
there are were unable to make t meeting
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
but I can say that we have as department
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
has been actively actively in involved
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
since the purchase of Hamstead and with
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
the leadership in place um we understand
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
there has been some challenges over the
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
summer we've acted quickly we have made
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
leadership changes there and that goal
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
of that leadership is to work hand inand
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
with the leadership of the contractor
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
and to be more collaborative in and to
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have our pulse and
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on um we've been
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
working actively with the local Town
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal and law enforcement as well as
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
the state police and our interventions
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
have um have equated to a decrease in in
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
um in calls to the the local Hamstead
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
police and so is top of mine and we are
 
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
there every day working on it and so I'm
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
H I'd be happy to have commissioner
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
weaver or associate um excuse me Deputy
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
Commissioner H now as of yesterday um
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
reach out and schedule some time with
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
this group to talk more at
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
depth further question you I mean
 
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
reading that the police are physically
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
restraining children so they can be
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
medicated into submission this is a
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
hospital and I it is really concerning I
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
think probably not just to me but it's
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
certainly really concerning to me I want
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
Hamstead to be
 
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.109 align:start position:0%
Hamstead to be
successful

00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
and we have not been
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
told that we haven't given the
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
department the resources they need to
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
make it successful if there is
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
something that the department needs to
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
make it successful I hope you will tell
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
us because this is really
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
concerning thank you thank
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
you dalland thank you Mr just to follow
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
up you know first of all we don't have
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
enough Troopers to cover the roads so
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
when you tell me that we need Troopers
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
to go to himad that's highly problematic
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
we got 70 plus vacancies as far as state
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
troopers are concerned so we don't have
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
the people that's number one and if the
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
local community's law enforcement is
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
being called upon they have to get
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
themselves out of other items to address
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
these situations we spent a lot of money
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
to get the hospital we spent 13 millions
 
00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
of American Recovery money to buy the
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
facility because the facility was going
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
to take the place of what we were doing
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
in the past at New Hampshire hospital
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
all right so we close those beds we move
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
them over here we were supposed to be
 
00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.069 align:start position:0%
them over here we were supposed to be
able

00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
able
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
to take care of the Deeds of these
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
children we visited the place and we saw
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
what was going on at the place and we
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
saw the restrictions in terms of the
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
usage of space there was a lot of space
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
that wasn't used because we didn't we
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't get people so just following up
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
with what Senator Rosell said if you
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
can't get the people and you need more
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
resources there's a place to
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
come but we are being uh affected by the
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
newspaper articles people call us and
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
say what the heck is going on here and
 
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
and U the newspaper articles sometimes
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
they overblown you what's what's the
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
real truth and that's that's the real
 
00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
issue but the Public's perception that
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
we're not doing the job and the fact
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
that we have these huge lapses from HHS
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
because we don't spend the money that
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
we've allocated that's very very
 
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
concerning to me very concerning to me
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
but you can lapse a hundred million doll
 
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a significant problem we
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
all say gez we don't have enough money
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
well we don't have enough money we're
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
lapsing it and that money where's that
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
money where the laps is going they're
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
going into the Revue stabilization fund

needs this is look at this is something
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
that really really concerns me I've
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
dealt with kids all of all of my life
 
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I I remember what we used to do
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
here and we've made dramatic
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
changes but this kind of stuff is very
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%

specifics of of whether we need
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
additional resources or not at a later
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%

Lehman thank you Mr chairman so a number
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
of us have been sitting around the table
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
and dealing with a cunu nightmare and
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
this appears to be another nightmare
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
here and the making and not to put
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
either one of you on the spot but you
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
haven't really said what is going on
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
what's caused the problems that
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
represent uh Senator rosenal mentioned
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
in the article why haven't we been made
 
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
aware of it uh why is the Press hearing
 
00:55:44.829 --> 00:55:44.839 align:start position:0%
about it before we are so what is going
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
there hi thank you for your question um
 
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to to the timeline of
 
00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.069 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to to the timeline of
communication

00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
around the events at Hamstead or or or
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
how this group is traditionally informed
 
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
on on these events um I can I can just
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
say that based on based on the events
 
00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:10.839 align:start position:0%
that have happened and some of the
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
security security challenges and risk
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
we've we've done everything we can to
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
ensure that their security staff is
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
fully um staffed I believe as of this
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
week correct um they are and that
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
there's been changes in leadership to
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that that the situations that
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
have happened over the summer do not
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
happen um again and that we're doing
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
everything we can to keep the kids safe
 
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
as well as um you know get to capacity
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
as soon as we can so as Nathan mentioned
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
the RFP is being re-released um to look
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
at the contractor and I know it's not a
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
perfect answer um again commissioner
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
Weaver and Deputy Commissioner hen
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
likely have more information more
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
specific specifics to share with you
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure they'd be happy to follow
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
up Unfortunately they weren't able to
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
come today but I don't want to misspeak
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
as I don't have all of the answers to
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
today follow
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
up so again this is offered in the
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
spirit of uh help helping the fiscal
 
00:57:15.549 --> 00:57:15.559 align:start position:0%
committee um in in HHS oversight as well
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
as the sununu impact committee this very
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
issue has come up what what happened we
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
we we we bought Hamstead it had a stable
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
state it didn't have all these problems
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
now it does what changed and the
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
response that we got back I think on a
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
on the record somewhere is that um the
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh patient Acuity at Hamstead was not as
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
high as the state changed it to being
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
and as a result some kids got brought
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
into Hamstead under sort of a new scheme
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
of of allowing more difficult Acuity and
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
that the Hamstead had not been designed
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
to have secure features like doors in
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
the hallways that shut they didn't have
 
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
the security staff basically it was a
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
little bit more of a surprise than I
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
think it should have and so they there
 
00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
was this huge problem and I I would
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
imagine if we were to look at the stats
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
I I got to believe that the number of
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
incidences and calls to the the police
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
has has been declining precipitously is
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
is my theory but um but so that's what I
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
right anything
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
further all right seeing none we don't
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
need a motion on this but I also had
 
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
questions on information items 23 311
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
and 312 that somewhat related um again
 
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
HHS I guess rep representative Earth had
 
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
2311 so thank you for taking the
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions I have five questions they're
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
fairly broad maybe even extremely broad
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
so I'm not expecting to be able to
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
answer them now but if you can at least
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
um take take note of them and U maybe
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
provide written responses I'd really
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so this is regarding the
 
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
annual report on the medicad expansion
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
program if I'm not
 
00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
mistaken and if I just Mr chair is I
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
just rattle through the five give them
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
time to in between to respond if they
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
want to yes okay so the first and Al
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
I'll just PA between them if you want to
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
respond that's great if you don't just
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
say you don't so describe quote the
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
funding of the nonfederal share
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
to include this is a quote from the uh
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note the funding of the
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
non-federal share to include profits
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
from The Liquor Commission through the
 
01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol prevention and treatment fund
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
and here's the really critical part and
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
limited the New Hampshire Health Plan
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
assessment to no more than the funding
 
01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
needed to cover the remainder amount not
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
to exceed the monies from insurance
 
01:00:23.029 --> 01:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
premium tax revenue and alcohol
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
prevention and treatment fund as well as
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
other funds returnable and I I know
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
that's related to hb4 from 2019 um if
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
you want to respond now or
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
later I think I can help and if um my
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
answer is not enough I'd be happy to as
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
you requested put something in writing
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the granted Advantage
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
Program the federal match is 90% Federal
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
10% um other funds the other funds are
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
comprised of uh
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
three things um primarily uh the the
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
first one would be the premium tax which
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
is a standard tax applied to all health
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
insurance policies of 2% on the the
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
policies that are ungranted
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
Advantage the the liquor um profits that
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
there's a uh that there's a specific
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
percentage there that's run about 10
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
million or so a year um in 200 I think
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh 18 or or 19 um the New Hampshire
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
Health Plan um is also assessed an
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
amount and the the amount that's
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
assessed is to make up that make up the
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
10% so whatever liquor and the premium
 
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
tax don't um equal up to New Hampshire
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
Health Plan makes a contribution of an
 
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
assessment to fill out that
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
10% the New Hampshire Health Plan um in
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
in um the prior legislation that was
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
passed this last session didn't want
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
that to be an open-ended item and they
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
said they they would match up to
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
50% meaning match exactly what both the
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
liquor and the premium tax equaled and
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
so that's what's been making up the the
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
primarily the the uh the non-federal
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
share there are a couple other um
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
straggle items like for example if we
 
01:02:23.069 --> 01:02:23.079 align:start position:0%
were able to recoup some money or on
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
something that was paid out that also
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
helps fill that 10% but that's that's Mo
 
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
majority of the funding is through those
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
sources and be happy to it's a lot to
 
01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:38.119 align:start position:0%
follow I'd be happy to map it out um for
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
you uh and for the
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
committee so just to respond to that you
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
don't need to respond to this but just
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
so you understand why I still have
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
questions I'd like like to know what the
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
N Hampshire plan assessment is but I
 
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
don't need to understand that right now
 
01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:50.839 align:start position:0%
but the really critical part of what I
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
was reading there
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
was assessments to no more than the
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
funding needed to cover the remainder
 
01:03:01.269 --> 01:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
amount not to exceed the monies from
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax revenue and that
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
become we don't you like I said you
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
don't need to respond to that now but
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
that becomes relevant in some of my next
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
questions in terms of what's what
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
so essentially it's those sources fill
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
up the the nonfederal share I think the
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
remainder amount based on the the
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
current legislation that passed in hb2
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
adjusted how that calculation is done a
 
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
little bit but at the end of the day the
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
same concept applies which is we have to
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
come up with 10% of funding that's not
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
General funds and it's basically those
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
sources um liquor tax and the health
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
plan assessment um the health plan
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes assessment is may have known
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
as the New Hampshire Health Plan
 
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes was known as the high-risk
 
01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:54.039 align:start position:0%
pool historically they're very important
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
in the 1332 waiver that the insurance
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
department has in terms of helping us
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
with the the individual Market but
 
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's their function today they
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
have the function of the supporting the
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
the 1332 waiver through for the
 
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
insurance department and they an
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
assessment on all policies that that
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
that apply that leads to the funding of
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh granted
 
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.470 align:start position:0%
uh granted
Advantage

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
Advantage
 
01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
okay it sounds like you started to
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
address the significance of the
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
remainder account and all that that go
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
for now um that was in my next question
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
um can you describe the provision this
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
is another quote the provisions of the
 
01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
Managed Care contract to protect against
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
overfunding the Managed Care
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
organizations is addressed in the risk
 
01:04:40.349 --> 01:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
settlement mechanism
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
yes there're um in the environment that
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
we've been recently operating in where
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment shot up because of the
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage um and uh the the
 
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
volatility and healthc care provider uh
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
capacity that predicting what would be
 
01:05:04.589 --> 01:05:04.599 align:start position:0%
um the actual spend that we would see we
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
um you know recommended not only by
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
actuaries but by CMS was to put in
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
Provisions to protect from overfunding
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
the program and um limited um The Profit
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
potential for the mcos and you know the
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
way it's worked out um has been that the
 
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
state has gotten a refund back of um of
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
the funding because they didn't
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
experience um you know utilization that
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
cost a lot more than what we had actuly
 
01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.829 align:start position:0%
cost a lot more than what we had actuly
provided

01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
for thank you that one made sense um is
 
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
there a document showing the annual
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
total cost of the state I.E the
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
non-federal dollars and a detail
 
01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
breakdown of where that funding is
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
coming from in law in law over time and
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
you kind of touched on it in your
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
earlier response so maybe this one if
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
you just get it to me in a written form
 
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate it sure though we're
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
required each each quarter to do a
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
sufficient funding letter to U
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
leadership um the Senate President the
 
01:06:15.549 --> 01:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
speaker and and the governor um we're
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
also required every August to do a
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
funding um letter it's actually one of
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
the in our conversation offline it's one
 
01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:24.839 align:start position:0%
of the letters that I provided to you
 
01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
that provides the detail in terms of
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
what is the expenditure um and um what
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
are the other sources of funding
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
um let me zo I appreciate that and I
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
have read the letter and it does make
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
sense um I guess I'm asking something a
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
little in a little different format if
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
you will so when we do our budgeting
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
like the state budget for Medicaid for
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
instance right you know you can see the
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
costs you can see the breakdown of the
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
revenues Federal General and so on it's
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
basically Federal in general maybe other
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
in some cases um in this case what
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
you're describing
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
shows costs in you know different ways I
 
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
just want to see here's the cost for the
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
everything um all the little bits and
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
pieces and here's exactly where the uh
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
revenues are coming from pretty much as
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
you were starting to as you describe in
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
the first part of your answer but just
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
in know in a nice clean way over time so
 
01:07:21.269 --> 01:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
we can see how the cost of the program
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
has changed over time both in terms of
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
going up but also now that it's coming
 
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
down yes and and in the letter you'll
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
see is that we're expecting it to come
 
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
down $100 million um from right you know
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
the current last fiscal year yep um and
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
the last one is
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
um and this relates to a spreadsheet you
 
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
sent me that I res shared with you
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
recently um so if it doesn't make sense
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can refer to that why
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
would net nonfederal funds this is my
 
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
term not not not in the document why
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
would net non-federal funds show a
 
01:07:59.309 --> 01:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
surplus in a given year when hb4 2019
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
funds transferred exceed that Surplus
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
amount I.E why is too much money being
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
transferred so kind of in the bigger
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
picture standpoint right we make a
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
forecast of what the program is going to
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
cost we asked for funding for it you
 
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:17.719 align:start position:0%
know the risk card is a good example of
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
you know if we don't get it perfect
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
right is to make sure that the money
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
comes back to support the program in
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
future years and the the the budget has
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
had the Medicaid uh U
 
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
non-aps because there's been a lot of um
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in terms of what the the
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
volume and utilization has been and
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
that's that I think is what you're
 
01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
seeing in that chart is that in some
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
periods um for example we may from the
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
non-federal share portion or even the
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
federal share portion expect to get more
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
than spend more than we we did and so if
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
we have a surplus of that we just apply
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
it to the next year to reduce the burden
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want to add to to
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
clarify representative F though the
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that you're referring to is
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Healthcare program
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
only so so RSA 126 AA continually it has
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
there's a trust fund and it's
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated to the
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
department so to Henry's point we make
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
our best estimates if there are
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
variation there is a surplus and that
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
would carry forward and that would feed
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
into the next year's estimates on what
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
funding would be needed okay so I
 
01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
understand what you just said y but it
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
seems like that the way you described it
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
gives you a motivation to over budget
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
because you're going to just keep
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
carrying it forward and building up a
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
huge Surplus we we don't we don't for
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
for the granted Advantage Healthcare
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
program there is no motivation to over
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
budget um as passed in hb2 this past and
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
again the funding has changed a little
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
bit but not significantly um if I could
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
just provide some context here so like
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
if I'm these numbers I can validate more
 
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
precisely but just broadly like we had a
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
$1.3 billion budget for State fiscal
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
year 23 to cover the entire Medicaid
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
Program and I think like $33 million was
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
the recruitment of the risk card so it's
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
a percentage of total spend it's really
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
not a high amount and a portion of that
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
33 million is due back to the feds for
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
their share so you the the you were
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
talking about one or two% kind of um you
 
01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
know uh variation from projected and and
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
that's um I think you would probably
 
01:10:37.709 --> 01:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
find to be pretty reasonable based on
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
how health care costs kind of float
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
around maybe that other chart I asked
 
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
about would would help me here because
 
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
basically the 2019
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
HP4 as I understand it is how you top up
 
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
to to solve the problem that you are
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough money going based on
 
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
what the law was prior to that point in
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
time and so you're basically topping it
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
up to which I get but why would you top
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
it up more than is needed to just
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
maintain as opposed to overshoot by $6
 
01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
million for instance now I realize these
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
are much smaller numbers in the Medicaid
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
Program for sure but on a percentage
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
basis you know $6 million is substantial
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
as an over overrun if you will so at at
 
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
the time we're talking about a a half a
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
billion almost a $600 million
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
expenditure for granted Advantage at the
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
high point of enrollment um and going
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
forward that top off part that you
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
talking about hb4 we're projecting in 24
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
and 25 not to need to to tap into that
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
provision it's because granted Advantage
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment today is back to about 57,000
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
individuals we were at
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
97,000 just on on March 31st so the the
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
whole situation we're getting back to a
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
more normal period there's still some um
 
01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
volatility because you're seeing some
 
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
people who leave may be the lower Acuity
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
patients and so I think we're we're
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
getting to a more stable State and HP4
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
was really there for you know a
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
contingency that actually
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
happened right just one last comment
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
then um when you use percentages
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
comparing it to the whole $500 million
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
program is not fair because we uh pick
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
up only 10% so really what you want to
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
be comparing it to is the 10% which is
 
01:12:25.229 --> 01:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
something on the order and right now
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
around 56 million and has been as low as
 
01:12:28.629 --> 01:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
33 million a few years ago and it's
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
coming back down again
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
now I was my percentage was based on the
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
not just the uh both the federal and
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
non-federal you're right in terms of the
 
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
just looking at the the uh state if you
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
will right and the overages I'm talking
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
about are the state overages not
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
anything related to the
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
federal thank you for your responses
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to follow up with
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
something more concrete so you have
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
something to take away for future
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
reference thanks very much represent
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
Edwards had questions on
 
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
312 I do do we want to move 311 or it's
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
an information oh that's information
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um okay yes I do thank you Mr
 
01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.990 align:start position:0%
thank you um okay yes I do thank you Mr
chair

01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
um first I I want to congratulate uh you
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
for uh all of the hard work and great
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
analysis on doing the Medicaid uh
 
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate adjustments um I only
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
get called when uh people are unhappy
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
about something in
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
DHHS but I I I got a call a concern in
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
September about how the process was
 
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
going and then I got a call from the
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
same person in October who said she's
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
been working this issue uh on
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates in her segment of
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
the industry for 37 years and this is
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
the best that she's ever seen uh her
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
input considered and have the state
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
respond to so so I think that's all
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
that's all really great and I just want
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
to thank you for all of that because the
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
Committees had ideas on what this thing
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
would look like back in June J you know
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
and earlier but you guys really uh
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
delivered so I want to thank you thank
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
you um the the for the question relative
 
01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
to representative ver this is going to
 
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
be easy uh because it because we sort of
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
rehearsed it earlier um under
 
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh are people
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
authorized uh to uh to Medicaid uh
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility if they are in the state in
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
a nonadjudicated
 
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
status claiming that they are an asylum
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
Seeker are Asylum SE in other words are
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
Asylum Seekers who have not yet been
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
adjudicated Medicaid
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
eligible there there is no eligibility
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
status for someone who is not legally
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
authorized to be here I will say that
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
all states are required if to in an
 
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
emergency situation if someone shows up
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
in an emergency situation to to cover
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
that cost on a one-time basis but
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's no continued eligibility that
 
01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.590 align:start position:0%
there's no continued eligibility that
that

01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
exists followup followup okay so I'm I'm
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
I'm being really clear here because you
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
you use the term lawful there that
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
they're they're residing yeah so so I'm
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer I'm not certainly not an
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
immigration lawyer so I'm just asking
 
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.270 align:start position:0%
immigration lawyer so I'm just asking
very

01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
specifically um given that somebody who
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
is seeking Asylum is in the United
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
States lawfully until they get
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
adjudicated three five years later um in
 
01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
that interim
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
period they're residing here lawfully
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
but does that mean they're eligible for
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid typically there's a five-year
 
01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
waiting period for those that can gain U
 
01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:01.750 align:start position:0%
waiting period for those that can gain U
Medicaid

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
Eligibility this past session um
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislature adopted the lawfully
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
residing for pregnant women and and
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
their children um which uh shortens the
 
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
fiveyear period that will go into effect
 
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
January 1 but um other than that you

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
levels of federal legally residing is is

uh you've done a great job putting this
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
all together and I really really
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%

01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:01.639 align:start position:0%

you've done it's really been very very
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
helpful and I just have one question and
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
again you don't need to answer it now
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
but I'm just curious as to how the rate
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
increases that we that youve put in
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
place here will impact the granted
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
Advantage costs to the state going
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
forward um the in the informational item
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
the last two columns um
 
01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh incorporate the federal and
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
non-federal share that um had to be
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
taken into account so that the rates in
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
the program are standed across the
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
entire portfolio of uh programs in
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
Program so the total impact is $33
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
million is that accurate 34
 
01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:51.990 align:start position:0%
million is that accurate 34
maybe

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
thank representative Earth if you turn
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
to page um three of attachment one um
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
there are the totals for the other funds
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage other funds in uh
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
column I and in column J there's the
 
01:18:08.669 --> 01:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
total federal granted advantage and
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
federal funds right there yeah so when
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
when you look at um collectively with
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
this appropriation the 134 million of
 
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
General funds that was made via hb2 it
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
comes out to about 300 million in change
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
total dollars that will be allocated
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
towards increasing that some have
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
already increased Medicaid
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
rates thank you very much course Senator
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
Bradley for a question yeah I also want
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
to follow up on um what representative
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
Edwards said I think um those of us in
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate should give a shout out to
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
our friends in the house for
 
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
establishing the threshold of as I
 
01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
recall about $134 million in um Medicaid
 
01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
rate increases you guys did a lot of
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
really good work um listen to these
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
folks when it came over to
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
us um we accepted that number of the
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
$134 million but um enable the
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
department to be able to comply with all
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
the waivers that they have to comply
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
with the parody issues that they have to
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
comply with and so this informational
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
item is the result of that and I think
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
that along with what Jess said you know
 
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
you guys deserve the entire department
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
deserves a big huge shout out for
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
pulling this together um yeah there
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
there were some people that would have
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
liked a little more um but I think
 
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
overall um you've risen to the task and
 
01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.270 align:start position:0%
overall um you've risen to the task and
and

01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
shown um you know the benefit of what
 
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
you folks established in your budget
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we accepted in terms of the overall
 
01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.590 align:start position:0%
that we accepted in terms of the overall
so

01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
I think everybody deserves to take a bow
 
01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
but I I just want
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
to Mr chairman give you and your
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
committee a shout out and then the work
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
that you guys did so you made it easy
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
for us in the Senate thank you Senator
 
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
Bradley and you're right it was a
 
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
department effort and one of the key
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
people is sitting behind us uh Christy
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
Roy who's a director of the rate setting
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
unit and um you know without her it
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
would have not gone as well she did a
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%

01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%

01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%

items before we go to the uh audits I'd
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
like to confirm a date for next month
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%

by national professional organizations
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
and for most most professions we found
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's requirements were in the

to other states we
 
01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
reviewed while we found statutes and
 
01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
rules did not impose substantial

licensing barriers some board procedures
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
may have unnecessarily prolonged the

application process and impeded
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
streamlining for example some boards
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
required case-by casee review of every
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
application at a monthly board meeting
 
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of the licensing risk posed
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
which prolonged the time it took to get
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
a license

01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
overarching state laws allowed temporary
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
licenses to be valid valid for up to 120
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
days time frames in board laws and rules
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
allowed them to be valid for between 30
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
and 100 0
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
days finally state laws required boards
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
to develop processes to facilitate
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
portability for members of the military
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
or military spouses however no boards
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
have developed these
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
processes our next two observations
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
numbers five and six address timeliness
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
of application processing we found time
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
limits in some boards rules did not
 
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
align with overarching state laws for
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
certain aspects of the application
 
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
process additionally while we found
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
boards met processing timelines
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
established in statute most of the time
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
they could not actually determine
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
whether they were meeting timelines
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
because the licensing system did not
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
collect dates associated with key events
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
that would have been necessary to
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
monitor timeliness nor was there a
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
process to manually collect these dates
 
01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
compliance observations seven and eight
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
address developing or expanding a tiered
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
approach to approving license
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
applications a tiered approach including
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
approvals at levels below the full board
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
could have reduced approval time for
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
some applications presenting low risk
 
01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
allowing these applicants to practice
 
01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
sooner two boards required all
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
applications to be reviewed by a month
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
at a monthly board meeting even ones
 
01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
that pose lower risk one board allowed
 
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
oplc staff to approve some applications
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
and issue licenses however other types
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
of lower risk applications could have
 
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
potentially been approved without full
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
Board review reducing the time for some
 
01:31:24.109 --> 01:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
applicants to be licensed in July 2023
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
the oplc became responsible for
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
approving or denying license
 
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
applications facilitating this tiered
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
approach however oplc is still
 
01:31:35.709 --> 01:31:35.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
process observation number nine
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
addresses board practices for reviewing
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
applicants criminal histories state laws
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
allowed boards to disqualify applicants
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
for criminal convictions that had a
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
substantial or direct relationship to
 
01:31:52.109 --> 01:31:52.119 align:start position:0%
the profession and if disqual qualifi
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
the applicant protected Public Safety
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
however boards did not identify which
 
01:31:59.109 --> 01:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
convictions were substantially direct
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
substantially or directly related to
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
their profession and three boards
 
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
required applicants disclose criminal
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
charges even if they did not result in a
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
conviction laws also allowed boards to
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
consider the time passed since the
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
conviction but none of the board's laws
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
or rules considered this and applicants
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
were required to disclose all
 
01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
convictions regardless of how long ago
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
the conviction
 
01:32:20.679 --> 01:32:22.510 align:start position:0%
the conviction
occurred

01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:32:25.109 --> 01:32:25.119 align:start position:0%
observations 10 11 and 12 address the
 
01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
need to develop rules for some licensing
 
01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
processes used by the boards ensuring
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
these requirements are clear and
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
consistently applied and reviewing
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
whether exam requirements may be too
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
restrictive that the delay that they
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
delay licensing or hinder portability
 
01:32:42.510 --> 01:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
for applicants who are already licensed
 
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
state this concludes my presentation I'd
 
01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
like to thank take the opportunity take
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to thank the PLC and
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
especially the boards for their
 
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
cooperation during the audit responding
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
to all 12 observations in addition to
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with their normal course of
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
business was not an easy feat but the
 
01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
boards were Cooperative worked hard to
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
respond to the observations and met our
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
reporting timeline so we wanted to make
 
01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
sure the committee was aware of their
 
01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
hard work um I'd like to invite Lindsay
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
Courtney up uh she's the oplc D
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
comments we going to have a couple
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
questions here but you can take a one of
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
those side seats and be ready to
 
01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
possibly answer it first Senator Pearl
 
01:33:31.629 --> 01:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
and then representative Edwards have
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
questions Senator Pearl is recognized
 
01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm quickly reading
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
through this as you're providing the
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
information the the summary that you're
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
reading is that essentially in here all
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
of that information it is uh so if you
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
look at our executive summary most of
 
01:33:47.709 --> 01:33:47.719 align:start position:0%
the stuff that I said in the very
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
beginning it comes directly from our
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
executive summary um so all of that
 
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
information is uh on pages one and two
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
and then the observations go into more
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
detail I I found the remarks as you
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
presented them very easy to follow was
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
it possible that you have a written
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
version of that you could get to me of
 
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
my remarks yes I do however I'm going to
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
defer to my director as to whether or
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
not I can release that if I could CER
 
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
Pro we'll have a transcript a Verbatim
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
transcript for this meeting so I can
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
make sure to get that to the members
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards uh thank you Mr chair
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
I I um this this feels like really very
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
good work so so thank you for that uh
 
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
you've got approximately six
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations here that uh you think
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
may need some legislative action I'd
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
like to ask you two questions about
 
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
those one uh is there one or two of them
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
that would have the biggest impact on
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
improving our service capacity in the
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
state and if so what are they uh I'm
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
looking for a prioritization of these
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
six and then sort of attendant with that
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that we don't drop the
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
Baton who who is working with who in the
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to take legislative action
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
um so I will address the first part of
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
that and I will defer the second part to
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh Lindsay Courtney uh to answer so as
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
far as the observations that require
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
legislative action there's six of
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
them none a lot of them are clarifying
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
some language or um getting rid of uh
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
negated language that has Su that was
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
superseded by uh more recent laws so uh
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
as far as impact I think number 12 may
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
have the most impact which is uh looking
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
at the exam requirements for uh marriage
 
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
and family therapists and uh clinical
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors the laws are
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
very very prescriptive as far as what
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
national exam a person must pass there
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
are other exams out there that would um
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
prevent someone who passed a different
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
exam from being licensed in New
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from getting a license so as
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
far as impact that one probably has the
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
most impact um and most of the others
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
are removing some negated language
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
looking to see um clarifying some laws
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
to let me back up a little bit uh oplc
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
was given some authority to oversee
 
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
certain processes some of that language
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
is still in the board's practice act so
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
making that a little more clear that the
 
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility has been transferred to
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
oplc and not creating that confusion
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
between the two uh languages that don't
 
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
exactly match um I think that that would
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
help clarify some certain things but
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
most of these recommendations are in
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
that nature so so thank you for drawing
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
our attention to observation number 12
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's that that's useful your all your
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
comments are useful and then so for item
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
12 specifically who in oplc or wherever
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
is working with which legislature
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
legislator to to implement 12 I think I
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
can answer that question
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
partly the Prof the uh this division
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
works for the fiscal committee when they
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
bring an audit to us we're the first
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
people that see it no one else has seen
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
it until we've clear it and publish it I
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
always take the action that we are
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for anything that comes to
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
us needing legislative change I usually
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
file it myself I'm going to have to go
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
to rules committee to ensure that we can
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
get this in in a timely way since both
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the house um have passed
 
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
the deadlines for final legislation I
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
will go to rules and I will ask to for
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
permission to file the bill and then I
 
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
will ask for
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
um for the different six different ones
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
who might be the liaison obviously
 
01:37:59.709 --> 01:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
they're different boards and so on and
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
so I can take this I admire the work you
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
always do excellent work thank you this
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
was very timely as we're hearing from
 
01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
HHS the problem in Staffing all these
 
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
positions and you did some wonderful
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
work where you when I take it to OS you
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
even mention the law that needs to be
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
changed they're going to appreciate that
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to make it much quicker also
 
01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:25.239 align:start position:0%
the work you've done for the boards in
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
appendix D which you found they'd never
 
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
done this before should hopefully
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
expedite when someone comes from another
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
state all they've got to do is look at
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
appendix D and you know if it's all if
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
it's all green and yellow boom don't
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
waste a lot of time we we did only look
 
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
at 15 states so there are other states
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
and we've talked to the boards about how
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
to prioritize looking at other States as
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
well it's an excellent start Senator
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
rosenell thank you Mr chairman I just
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I have filed a bill
 
01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:02.679 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
unrelated which could be a vehicle for
 
01:39:06.719 --> 01:39:08.470 align:start position:0%
unrelated which could be a vehicle for
these

01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
statuto are you willing to to put all
 
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
these on it yes I have already texted
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
director Courtney asking if we could
 
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
chat after this
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
meeting so I guess what would be
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
required if we if we saw a liaison for
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
each of the six ones because there quite
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
often involved different boards so when
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
we and I would like to be a co-sponsor
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
with you oh
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
yes because I take very seriously when
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
this audit division comes before us and
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
said you need Law changes you're talking
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
to me that's my I want to put you on my
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and so you know thank you I
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
don't want them to spend a Year's work
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
and then have every but just
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
say and not do a thing this is an
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
important method for us to correct our
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
legislation sen thank thank you Mr
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chairman both ncsl and CSG
 
01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:08.679 align:start position:0%
have spent a lot of effort working on
 
01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and working on boards it uh
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that that work has
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
already been prated it could really be
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh used quite effectively in terms of
 
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
what legislative changes we need and how
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
more of a synergistic relationship could
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
be established because one of the
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
problems that we face is is the Dilemma
 
01:40:29.639 --> 01:40:30.629 align:start position:0%
problems that we face is is the Dilemma
of

01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
nonreciprocity for a person coming
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
coming from from our state from another
 
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
state and that's a barrier that that uh
 
01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
we've got to overcome because you need
 
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
we need a fluid situation here and the
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
national organizations have worked hard
 
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
to try to get that done just a C thank
 
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
you and Senator delandro the first four
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
observations in our report actually
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
address portability and trying to create
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
a better process for people coming from
 
01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:03.910 align:start position:0%
a better process for people coming from
other

01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%

you all in favor say I oppose
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
committee um representative Edwards so
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
I'm I I know you're trying to get out of
 
01:41:50.669 --> 01:41:50.679 align:start position:0%
here and I appreciate the hard work I
 
01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
just just wanted to say that um that
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you to the LBA for the
 
01:41:56.669 --> 01:41:56.679 align:start position:0%
collaborative environment in which we
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
worked on these issues and to the boards
 
01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
um but really as you'll see there are
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
two issues that were really identified
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
as it relates to oplc one is the current
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
conflicts in the law happy to report
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
that um we have been working with
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and
 
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative groda out of Edna um and
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
she is um has has has plans to um uh
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
file legislation um that would uh
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
eliminate a lot of these conflicts so I
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
I think that's already in the works we
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
drafted the language was about 120 pages
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
so when you see it um I apologize in
 
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
advance um the second issue really
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
concerns portability and I'm and this
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
audit was particularly challenging
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
because of all of the changes during the
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
last legislative session and I just want
 
01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
to thank uh members of the general court
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
for all of the hard work that you did
 
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
because I think HB 594 in particular was
 
01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
really critical to moving the ball
 
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
forward as it relates to portability so
 
01:42:59.790 --> 01:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
that was the legislation that
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
essentially gave the office to uh the
 
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
authority to determine what states are
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
substantially similar or what criteria
 
01:43:07.470 --> 01:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
is substantially similar that work is
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
already um being done um the interum
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
rules that the office filed uh related
 
01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
to um 15 professions I believe but
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
included all of the Mental Health
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
Professions and were effective
 
01:43:24.189 --> 01:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
on Sunday and um through these new rules
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
we were able to already get through
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
hundreds of applications not necessarily
 
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
in the Mental Health Professions but
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
particularly for Physicians um so I
 
01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:33.639 align:start position:0%
think a lot of this work is underway and
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is really just a
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
cleanup effort as it relates to the
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority I just wanted to
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
mention two things for consideration as
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
it relates to the exam and number 12 um
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
I think that requires a little bit more
 
01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
inquiry because I think
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
um there could be some consequences as
 
01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
it relates to portability it were the
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
state to accept other
 
01:43:59.950 --> 01:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
examinations um the state is currently a
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
part participating state in the Mental
 
01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
Health compact I the New Hampshire
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative on that compact
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
commission and part of the requirements
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
to participate in the compact is that
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
you um require a national exam so I'm
 
01:44:18.109 --> 01:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
not saying that the other exams wouldn't
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily qualify um because the
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
commission is currently promulgating
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
rules as it relates to the exam but
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
there could be unintended consequences
 
01:44:27.629 --> 01:44:27.639 align:start position:0%
and so we may want to look into that a
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
little bit um deeper before pursuing
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
additional legislation and as of right
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
now I believe over 40 states have signed
 
01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
on to the Mental Health
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
compact thank you for your thank you for
 
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
your time and we just keep piling stuff
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
on you for licensing and it's awesome
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's great we're doing great work so
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
thank you to the board and to the staff
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
no it's it's been wonderful well you
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
have streamlined things in men ly and
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate it but it kind of
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
loads it up in your
 
01:44:58.109 --> 01:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
office so keep up to good work thank you
 
01:45:02.350 --> 01:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair all right Senator
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
Pearl thank you so director as as we you
 
01:45:07.589 --> 01:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
brought up compacts and it was actually
 
01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a question I was going to
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
ask you as as we move forward and we
 
01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
start to adopt these compacts do you
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
think that is going to ease up some of
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
the need for reciprocity and Licensing
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
because some of the folks that are
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
coming here maybe licens in other states
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
and they can do so under the compact
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
rather than needing to come under the
 
01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
reciprocity yes so yes Senator so there
 
01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
essentially are two compact models
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's the multi-state compact model
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
which is what uh nursing has which
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
basically means if you get a license in
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
your home state you can go anywhere
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's part of the compact that is the
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
best in terms of portability there is
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
risk there because you don't know who's
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
in your state and so um when we talk
 
01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:48.679 align:start position:0%
about Mental Health Professions in
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
particular where they're not necessarily
 
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
always working in an environment where
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
there's supervision certain professions
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
have chosen a different model which is a
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice which is that you
 
01:45:59.229 --> 01:45:59.239 align:start position:0%
still have to come to each state and get
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
a privilege based on streamlined
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
requirements the benefit to a compact is
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
always that you can share data there's a
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that you share data so as it
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
relates to investigations and discipline
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
we know more about that person if we're
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
part of the compact than we don't but I
 
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
view it as really concurrent models that
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
you could use there are some states that
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
are never going to participate in a
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
compact for various reasons um and that
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean though that they don't have
 
01:46:29.229 --> 01:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
similar requirements and so really um I
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
think the state should be looking at um
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
all options for portability um you
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned um Senator dallesandro that
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
CSG and DOD have been working on this um
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
I've I've had the privilege of working
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
and drafting the social work compact
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
language um with CSG and it's really
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
intended to help support our military
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
families and to make it easier so um I
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of work that we can
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
um piggy back on and Implement in New
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you anything further
 
01:47:02.589 --> 01:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
members and I'm sure that Senator
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
rosemal would appreciate any of the rest
 
01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
of us being co-sponsors on the bill
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
since it's she's taking the lead on on
 
01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
doing all this and thank you for all the
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
good work you've done it should make it
 
01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
easier for OS and and hopefully we don't
 
01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
we'll talk to
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire as well and maybe get
 
01:47:25.390 --> 01:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
her in on it so we can see that we don't
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
have any conflicts and stuff she's she's
 
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
filed is there anything else to come
 
01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:32.310 align:start position:0%
filed is there anything else to come

01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
agree all right thank you very much I
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what the underlying bill that
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
she was going to put in and said so
 
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
there's one you don't know what
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill you're right but as long
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
as she inludes this
 
01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
St I'll have to I'll have to look it
 
01:48:24.910 --> 01:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.189 --> 01:48:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
