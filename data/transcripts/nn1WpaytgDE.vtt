we're going to continue with the office
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
that we're going to talk about the
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity and the division
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
of program quality those were deferred
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
from Tuesday I believe we're also going
 
00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
to listen to the Bureau of Information
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%

my director of The Office of Health

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
Equity
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
so you've been with us for a week uh
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
two and three quarters okay so you know
 
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
the important things you know how to
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
find the coffee pot you know where your
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
offices your where to park okay exactly
 
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.949 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
so the mission of our office if you take
 
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
a look at the first slide is to first of
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
all ensure Equitable access to dhhs's
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
programs and services but overall to
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
improve outcomes for the marginalized
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
populations here in New Hampshire and
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
when you look at the key goals that fall
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
from that it's to ensure that access and
 
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
outcomes for DHHS programs but also
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
overall for these different groups from
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
various demographic backgrounds and part
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
of the way we're going to do that is
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
through good communication and taking a
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
look at these various services and at a
 
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
baseline level that's ensuring we're
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
complying with the various state and
 
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
federal mandates that we are beholden to
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
including the refugee Services Program
 
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
that falls under this group
 
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
can I can I uh I want to give I want to
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
give you an overview of how I think
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
about your your job and your role
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
um uh and it comes from
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
um a very military background uh we
 
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
we've seen in other presentations we had
 
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
a University of New Hampshire Professor
 
00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:17.899 align:start position:0%
with us a few weeks ago who did a nice
 
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
thorough demographic lay down of New
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire showing the demographics uh
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
relative it kind of in a heat map way
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
what you know what percentage lived
 
00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:30.370 align:start position:0%
what you know what percentage lived
where

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:30.380 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
and um and so as I was listening to him
 
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
and seeing these Maps I started thinking
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
in a military mindset and to say uh okay
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
here here's a very specific set of area
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
codes in Nashua here's another specific
 
00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:50.339 align:start position:0%
set of area codes up uh along the
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont border along the river here's
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
another one south of Berlin you know
 
00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:57.380 align:start position:0%
they were very specific
 
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
clusters of of uh communities with I
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
would think marginalized populations and
 
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.410 align:start position:0%
would think marginalized populations and
so

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
um so as I'm looking at your
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
presentation I don't I don't I don't see
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
that kind of a geographic lay down of
 
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
where these sectors are
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm just thinking it may help
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
over the long run you know not not
 
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
tomorrow not not even in this budget
 
00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
cycle but in the long run I think if we
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
could uh connect the geographic spots
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
that were uh particular you know because
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
the people are living in a geographic
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
area generally right there's we're
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
seeing clusters uh that that that that
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
would help Focus us all on what we're
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
doing in a particular area and and
 
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know as we assess the
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
capabilities the clinical capabilities
 
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
in each of those areas
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
um whether or not they're adequate or
 
00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:58.019 align:start position:0%
sufficient and and where they're not
 
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
then we have a corrective action plan to
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
go fix them and so it's it would be very
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
driven by
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
communities and specific geographies
 
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
tied to specific capabilities and an
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
assessment of each capability of whether
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
or not it's adequate that that's sort of
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
my military mindset and given that you
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
hear two and a half weeks I just thought
 
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
I'd share that with you and maybe get
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the feedback and
 
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
perspective and certainly as you suggest
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at you know what
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
exists in the state from different areas
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
what the data says and what our
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
capabilities are in different areas
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
so have you seen uh the the kind of the
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
demographic mapping that I've described
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
because I I asked the professor for some
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
specific slides I don't mind emailing
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
them and I I don't know if that would be
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
new information to you or redundant with
 
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
something that you already have if
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
there's anything you'd like to share
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
we'd certainly be open to it
 
00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
okay and at this point I'll just let you
 
00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
talk I just thought I'd give you the the
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
a quick alignment on how I think we may
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
want to talk about these things in the
 
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
So within the office we have two
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
different accounting groups one is for
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
Refugee Services one is for the rest of
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
the team which includes some of the
 
00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
Communications office work Community
 
00:13:31.139 --> 00:13:32.389 align:start position:0%
Communications office work Community
engagement

00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:34.310 align:start position:0%
engagement
Etc

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
and you can see on the slide after that
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
we have the organizational chart which
 
00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:48.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
following that we also have some of the
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
key accomplishments of the office from
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
the past State fiscal year you'll see
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
that we've done a lot from the refugee
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
Services standpoint particularly in the
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
area of employment to get a lot of the
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
folks both employed and with a good
 
00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
hourly wage we've also seen a lot in the
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
hearing speech and vision area of doing
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
both putting together a lot of kits and
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of trainings and Communications
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
access overall a lot of effort that's
 
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
been put into improve standards and get
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
folks trained
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
and from a challenges standpoint some of
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
these things are honestly unique to
 
00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
this office but from a housing
 
00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
standpoint not necessarily unique to New
 
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire overall but wanting to find
 
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
housing for those in need and
 
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
transportation as well and from
 
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
Communications X at standpoint we
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
continue to push to get devices and
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
services and and training for folks to
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
be able to use those so clients from all
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
backgrounds can continue to access these
 
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.650 align:start position:0%
backgrounds can continue to access these
services

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just to put in
 
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.069 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just to put in
perspective

00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
um of I know that we've seen an increase
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
in refugees coming to the state is there
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
any way you can share with me where we
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
were maybe two years ago at this time in
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
the budget process versus now in terms
 
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
of numbers of peoples that have been
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
um we we have the arrival information
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
from the last few years and we can
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
certainly share more widely on that it's
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
on our website but we don't have a
 
00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:32.509 align:start position:0%
on our website but we don't have a
handout

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
handout
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
um we have the general numbers that are
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
coming up over the last few years but I
 
00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um acknowledge one piece
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
of that so in the last year and a half
 
00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:43.139 align:start position:0%
as we know there have been through the
 
00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:43.850 align:start position:0%
as we know there have been through the
um

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
the conflicts in Afghanistan and the
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
Ukraine we've seen an inbox of refugees
 
00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:51.050 align:start position:0%
Ukraine we've seen an inbox of refugees
um

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
seeking Asylum from those two countries
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
but it's actually that means our our
 
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
kind of standard program of refugee
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
resettlement from the federal government
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
has actually reduced those numbers so we
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
haven't actually seen an increase in
 
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
those arriving to New Hampshire just the
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
composition has been changed based on
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
the needs of the ukrainians and the
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
Afghan Sands of the Afghans I'm sorry
 
00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:16.339 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
and and and just to just to follow up on
 
00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
that from a budgetary standpoint what
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
what you'll see in account 7209
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
in classline 102 that this is 100
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
federal federal funds you will you will
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
see that increase within um within class
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
102 there uh and and those are the those
 
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
are the awards that we're projecting
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
from the federal government uh to
 
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:42.980 align:start position:0%
address that issue
 
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
and those awards are given because our
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
numbers are going up
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
or because the needs of the refugees are
 
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
that are coming are greater yes thank
 
00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:56.339 align:start position:0%
you for that question representative
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's more about the overall needs
 
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
of those who have arrived from
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan and the Ukraine
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and the federal government has has
 
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
been generous I think throughout with
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
all the states and then in the amount of
 
00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
funding but not because there's been an
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
increase I I will just acknowledge
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's an increase between Federal
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 and federal fiscal so the
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
refugee program is on a federal fiscal
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
year not a state fiscal year but there
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
was an increase that looks more drastic
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
but that was because of a result of kova
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
during the acute phase of the pandemic
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
there were there was a reduction just
 
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
generally in the number of folks that
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
were coming to the U.S
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
um and then those numbers started to
 
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
increase back to a normal rate across
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
the country so but as a whole the
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
increase in the numbers from Ukraine and
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan didn't increase our overall
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your for being
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
here appreciate it yeah is there any uh
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
the 900 000 interagency transfer from
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
7209 that's going to 7208 does that
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
correspond to the contract for program
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
services and can you comment a little
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
further on what those are sure so in
 
00:18:17.409 --> 00:18:17.419 align:start position:0%
account 7209 class 85
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
those are again 100 federal dollars
 
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
um those are those are transferred to
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
the um the Bureau of family assistance
 
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
and and that is used for
 
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
um cash assistance and that so so so
 
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.090 align:start position:0%
um cash assistance and that so so so
basically

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
um they would follow the same process
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
that whether they're a refugee or a New
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen they would apply for
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
benefits through that and then the
 
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
applicable criteria would be applied to
 
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:42.299 align:start position:0%
determine whether they're eligible or
 
00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:47.690 align:start position:0%
determine whether they're eligible or
not

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
are okay and it's just a coincidence
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
that it's the same amount as uh hit the
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
mic speaker yeah the same as a category
 
00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:58.580 align:start position:0%
um same amount as by coincidence and
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes yes that that is a coincidence
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
um that particular class line is
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
primarily used to pay for the language
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
Bank contract which is uh roughly 74
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
if we take a look at the next slide just
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
to give an idea of
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
how how many folks we've been serving
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
you can see from Refugee program
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
standpoint we continue to serve a good
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
amount of people so on on the left side
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
of the chart you'll see the year and
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
this is on a state fiscal year
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
standpoint so we've converted that to
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
the refugee program
 
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.270 align:start position:0%
the refugee program
and

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
serve the same amount as last year
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
roughly so 1500 note for the refugee
 
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
program this is an estimation because we
 
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539 align:start position:0%
could give a five-year roll total
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
because we provide services up to five
 
00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:24.299 align:start position:0%
years for refugees however the team has
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
estimated based on who's rolled in and
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
who's rolled off what the actual number
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
of people they've served on in any given
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
year rather than give you a five-year
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
figure which might not actually be
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
accurate so this is the most accurate we
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
can get for clients served
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
and for communication assistant counters
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see on the right this is anyone
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
who's requested assistance from a
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
linguistic standpoint from a speech
 
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.059 align:start position:0%
Vision uh hearing standpoint or also or
 
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
who required any type of translation
 
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.870 align:start position:0%
who required any type of translation
services

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
I was mentioning with the state Refugee
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
program those numbers are not the
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
arrival numbers per year that's the
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
total population served so you know we
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
might have anywhere from less than 100
 
00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:12.409 align:start position:0%
might have anywhere from less than 100
to

00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:12.419 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:15.059 align:start position:0%
um 400 folks arrive in a given year
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
usually around a little bit less on that
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
so but as Ruben said they're they're
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
eligible for services up to five years
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
our team through our contracts works
 
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to ensure that they
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
have all the social supports medical job
 
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
training in order to be acclimated and
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
to be employed and then be
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient which is the whole goal
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
of refugee resettlement program often
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
that a lot of that happens in the first
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
six months for some folks it's up to a
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
five-year program and with Elders as
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
well and then on the second side I just
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
I wanted to highlight I'm sorry with the
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
communication access I'm going to ask
 
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
you to get the microphone I'm sorry so
 
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
this helps me because I'm actually deaf
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's my Ada reasonable accommodation to
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
ask you to do that no I apologize my
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
voice does not project well so on the
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
second half with the communication
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
access assisted counter encounters
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
you'll notice there's quite a bit of
 
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
increase in 2021 in that
 
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.649 align:start position:0%
increase in 2021 in that
um

00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year and that is the result
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
of during the pandemic we served with um
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
the American sign language translators
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
through all the governor's press
 
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:24.380 align:start position:0%
conferences as well as offered
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
interpreters Services as requested or
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
needed at testing sites or vaccination
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
sites or anything related so that's why
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
there's such an increase in that year
 
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
given the Statewide efforts and the in
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
the governor's press conferences so I
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
just wanted to explain that because it's
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
quite noticeable so I recall from last
 
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
budget that you actually do quite a
 
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
number of different languages there's
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
that that this is says communication
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
access but that's primarily translation
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
right and and there's 20 or so languages
 
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
that you actively support
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
I I would have to get back to you with
 
00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
the exact number but there are a good
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
amount of languages that we do provide
 
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
translation for we also provide ASL
 
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
support as well and other accommodations
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
for folks who do need help whether
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's from a vision standpoint hearing
 
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.090 align:start position:0%
that's from a vision standpoint hearing
standpoint

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
um we have with our contracts through
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
this language Bank we're able to access
 
00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
either through a live interpreter or
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
kind of a video interpreted service for
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
for any language that is needed
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of the benefit of the
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
contract and and we also so we serve we
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
through the communication Access program
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
we ensure that those seeking our
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
services have have access to any whether
 
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
it's deaf and hard of hearing whether it
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
is a um
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
any language and then we also ensure
 
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
that our contracts through our vendors
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
that while we don't provide the services
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
through that contracted work that we're
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring that their compliant should
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
they be serving folks that have that are
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
deaf or hard of hearing or have other
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
so I I that that completes your what you
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
anticipated right can can you just
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
answer a general question then as
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe Ms Landry you can you
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
can answer this as well so in the next
 
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
two years what do you see your biggest
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm still working on understanding the
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
different roles the needs of the
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
it will be you know somewhat what you
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
suggested which is to understand you
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
know what are the you know targeted
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
needs right where should we be
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
allocating our time and our resources in
 
00:24:57.049 --> 00:24:57.059 align:start position:0%
terms of helping and providing
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
assistance right and going from there
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
all right do you want to add to that Mr
 
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.210 align:start position:0%
all right do you want to add to that Mr
Landry

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:04.220 align:start position:0%
Landry
 
00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
I would just add that
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
um to complement what Reuben said is you
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
know we this office has been without a
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
director for two years and so part of my
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
role in overseeing the office of Health
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
Equity kind of as associate commissioner
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
and interim director was to bring on an
 
00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:24.539 align:start position:0%
experienced director who can go out into
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
the communities to do exactly what
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
you're asking so to work internally with
 
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
our all of our programmatic areas to see
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
where there may be opportunities as well
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
as go out into the community across the
 
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
state right rural areas urban areas
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
anywhere where we feel that there's to
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
better understand the needs across the
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
Spectrum and so then Ruben's going to
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
help through his leadership bringing
 
00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:48.419 align:start position:0%
that back and and hope in two years
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
you'll know from us whether there's any
 
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
expansion of programs or what have you
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh did you have a question
 
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.470 align:start position:0%
uh did you have a question
representative

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair could you just uh
 
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
tell me what so there's a slight
 
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539 align:start position:0%
increase in the general funds of the
 
00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
7208 program I'm just curious where that
 
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:22.390 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.730 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
I am 99 no don't say 99. we'll say uh
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
86.5 certain that's given it to Friday
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
um that that the language Bank contract
 
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.149 align:start position:0%
um that that the language Bank contract
there

00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
I I think that's it but but I have to go
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
back and look at the history so so let
 
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
me follow up with you that way I'm not
 
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.909 align:start position:0%
me follow up with you that way I'm not
speculating

00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
speculating
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's great but which one you're
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
guessing what number
 
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.130 align:start position:0%
guessing what number
I

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
I believe it's the language bank but but
 
00:26:56.649 --> 00:26:56.659 align:start position:0%
I I because that's a 74
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh generally funded contract and and 26
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
Federal so instead of the higher match
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
that we typically see within this
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
account no that's great but I'm looking
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
at I don't see language Bank in the list
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
of in the budget
 
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
so it actually shows up in 70 in class
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
102. that that's where the contract is
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
so on page uh 1074 yeah yeah yeah that
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
we we can't list the actual names of the
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
contracts within the client within the
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
contract line but a way down below okay
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
oh you both represent Walton go ahead
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
so I wondered if for this office did you
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
have any uh prioritized needs in your
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
request of a governor for this office no
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so if I looked in a list of
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
contracts I'd probably find the language
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
Bank under there somewhere
 
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
it would be the the vendor name would be
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
a centria
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
and and the legal name for clarification
 
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
um within that document that that you
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
received it's it's the Secretary of
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
State registered name that will show up
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
I'm fairly certain it's a century is
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's there's doing business
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
names or DBA names but those won't show
 
00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:30.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any other questions thank
 
00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:35.510 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any other questions thank
you

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
so much
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you are you going to live in
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester where are you going to live
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'm currently living in Concord oh okay
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
all right there's a housing shortage I
 
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if you know that yet I'm
 
00:28:47.400 --> 00:29:04.370 align:start position:0%
don't know if you know that yet I'm
aware

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
um so so next up we have the division of
 
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
joined by
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Tasha Blanchard and I'm
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
the administrator for the Bureau of
 
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
director of the Bureau of program
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
quality wasn't able to join us this
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon so if they're real specific
 
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
questions around that we may have to
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
take it back but otherwise Tasha and I
 
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
will answer anything we can for you so
 
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
we're starting on um
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
on the division of program quality and
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
integrity mission statement is the first
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
slide for us
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't know if I have a page
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
number here oh page nine of the slide
 
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.909 align:start position:0%
number here oh page nine of the slide
deck

00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
deck
 
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
and the division of program quality and
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
integrity as you can see supports the
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
mission of the department by providing
 
00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539 align:start position:0%
data informed program development
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
quality performance Improvement and
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
ensuring accountability and operations
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
and financial integrity
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
and if you flip the page you'll see some
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
of our major goals
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
here one is to Design Systems of
 
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:13.820 align:start position:0%
provider and contractor management
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
and we do that in a few different ways
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
we we assess provider risk and if
 
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
there's Financial Risk we would work on
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
provider monitoring for that risk for
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate expenditure funds and we
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
also develop and Implement systems of of
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
financial provider oversight
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
we also um are establishing a consistent
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
department-wide quality definition and
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
framework everyone in the department all
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
of the program areas in the department
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
are working on providing quality
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
services but they can be using different
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
definitions and different methodologies
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to standardize and we
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
provide consistent framework for that
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
we do we work on data collection and
 
00:30:59.649 --> 00:30:59.659 align:start position:0%
transparency to improve health outcomes
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
this is in the Medicaid sphere the
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
behavioral health sphere the drug and
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
alcohol sphere we have a comprehensive
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
systems of monitoring performance
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
indicators and then evaluating results
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
relative to the established goals we
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
work with stakeholders and we have
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
access to Medicaid data primarily to
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
work do analytics in the Medicaid
 
00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
quality information system there are 200
 
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
metrics in that system related to the
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population that we are
 
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
monitoring for Quality all the time
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh we also have reportable performance
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
metrics that are established in
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
contracts enabling evaluation so that
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
program areas who are getting Services
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
delivered through contracts can assess
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not the contracts are meeting
 
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
their needs meeting the goals of their
 
00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
of their programs and then they can
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
adjust those contracts or adjust their
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
strategy if they need to based on the
 
00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
performance metrics that they're using
 
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh we also
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
um monitor compliance with federal and
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
state laws regulations and guidance so
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
we collaborate with programs and federal
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
Partners when there's a federal audit we
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
sort of act as a liaison between the
 
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
program areas and the Auditors to make
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
sure that the Auditors are getting every
 
00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:18.059 align:start position:0%
piece of information that they've
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
requested all of their requests are
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
responded to when there are findings we
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that the program areas have
 
00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
followed up with the findings and if
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
there are questioned costs we would make
 
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
sure the question costs get paid if if
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
we agree that it's appropriate to do so
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
um so yeah track and remediate audit
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
findings develop tools for internal
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
controls to mitigate non-compliance
 
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.029 align:start position:0%
controls to mitigate non-compliance
risks

00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
risks
 
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
um and then we would also yeah conduct
 
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
data collection and validation analytics
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
and evaluation of um Health Services
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
Delivery Systems and and that's
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
federally required for the Medicaid
 
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.750 align:start position:0%
federally required for the Medicaid
Program

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
Program
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
so we ensure compliance in that area as
 
00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:55.190 align:start position:0%
so we ensure compliance in that area as
well

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
on slide 11 that is a high level org
 
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
chart of the whole division
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
so uh myself director we have an
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant and then we
 
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
have our three areas we have the Bureau
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
of program Integrity which I'll go into
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
first and then the Bureau of program
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
quality and we also have an office of
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
so Bureau of oh key accomplishments I'm
 
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.009 align:start position:0%
so Bureau of oh key accomplishments I'm
sorry

00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:25.019 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
key accomplishments
 
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
um these are kind of across the whole
 
00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
division so in program quality first we
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
had the implementation of Quality
 
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
Reporting System for the adult Medicaid
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
dental benefit
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
adult Medicaid dental benefit is
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be um uh available for
 
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
our beneficiaries by April 1 and to do
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
that work we had to select all of the
 
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
performance metrics that we're going to
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
use to make sure that the benefit is
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
live and providing quality services and
 
00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059 align:start position:0%
that there's an adequate network of
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
dentists available to people and for
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
that we developed 78 different measures
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
tables plans and narrative reports that
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
we will be receiving from our Dental
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:14.099 align:start position:0%
um integration of Health analytics into
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Eligibility unwind uh which
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
is the the discontinuation of coverage
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
based on the end of the public health
 
00:34:23.169 --> 00:34:23.179 align:start position:0%
emergency we've developed a Medicaid
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
monthly Medicaid director's remedy
 
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
report on Managed Care Organization
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
performance standard violations so when
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh in in when our Managed Care
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
organizations are in any way not meeting
 
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
our standards we have a single report
 
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
that captures all of that information at
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
once and can be presented to the
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director all at once it's it's
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
a very comprehensive report
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and then recently within the last
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
year and I think we've discussed this
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
with the division a little bit already
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
we created the contracts quality
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
management unit which is a unit intended
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
um the contract non-medicade the other
 
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
contracts the other 400 contracts that
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
we have with vendors in the community so
 
00:35:11.569 --> 00:35:11.579 align:start position:0%
that we can establish some performance
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
metrics to make sure those vendors are
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
meeting our service requirements and
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
expectations and getting the department
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
closer to its ultimate goals
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
on program Integrity some of our key
 
00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
accomplishments we we had been short
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
staffed in our our special
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
investigations unit which
 
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.170 align:start position:0%
investigations unit which
um

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
which recovers money from beneficiaries
 
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
when it was incorrectly issued or issued
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
from fraud so from that we had uh having
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
been short staffed we had a backlog both
 
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
of claims and fraud investigations and
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
over the last year or so Tasha with her
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
staff have managed to eliminate the
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
claims backlog and they brought the
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
fraud investigation backlog down from
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
over a hundred to just over 300. so that
 
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.730 align:start position:0%
over a hundred to just over 300. so that
was

00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you they brought it from 800
 
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
down to 300 which is the direction we
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
wanted it to go
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh We've also separated our provider
 
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
enrollment functions we're responsible
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid provider enrollment
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
um and we're responsible for
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
investigation of providers for fraud
 
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse those had been combined
 
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh which was making it very difficult
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
for the administrator to focus on either
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
adequately so we split those out so we
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
can have a real emphasis on both areas
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
we revamped our financial Compliance
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
Unit so that we can do better Federal
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
audit oversight and subrecipient
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
monitoring and we strengthened uh MCO
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
oversight of fraud waste and abuse and
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
third-party liability through
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
standardized meetings and consistent
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
reports that we're getting from our
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I realize I'm talking a little bit
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
fast and possibly using um
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
language that that is unfamiliar to the
 
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
division so I'm going to pause for a
 
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
minute and see if folks have questions
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
favorite question
 
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
um regarding the monthly Medicaid
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
directors remedy report is that publicly
 
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
directors remedy report is that publicly
available

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it is I think that's
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
something we keep internal between us
 
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
and the Medicaid director the the
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
metrics however the quality metrics are
 
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
public on our mqis system so it's the
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
Medicaid quality information system and
 
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.329 --> 00:37:32.339 align:start position:0%
and then in the area of internal oh is
 
00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
it sorry
 
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.910 align:start position:0%
it sorry
okay

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh in the area of internal audit we
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
established a formal mechanism to ensure
 
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:41.060 align:start position:0%
compliance with executive order
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
201403 which requires updates on the
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
progress of corrective actions for LBA
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
Audits and we also had developed and
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
socialized a toolkit across the entire
 
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
department for standardized policies and
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
Crea and procedures so anybody and work
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
instructions so anyone across the
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
department who doesn't have a good
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
robust process for creating their own
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures can use this
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
toolkit and guidelines and templates to
 
00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
challenges we have these are the same
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
challenges we had in the last biennium
 
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
it's really Workforce capacity in order
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
to support some of the high-level data
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
analytic work that we do
 
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
um and identify the key trends and the
 
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
key opportunities that we want to use to
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
improve health outcomes
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
and information systems and software and
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
funding for kind of robust modern
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
systems that allow us to do the work
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
is that an is system specifically for
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
you or just generally available across
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
the department so that you have
 
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
something to access there
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
there are us that
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
would use if we had access to them
 
00:38:59.329 --> 00:38:59.339 align:start position:0%
um there are also vendors that we could
 
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
use who have their own systems that if
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
we contracted with those vendors would
 
00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
be able to to utilize their systems for
 
00:39:08.569 --> 00:39:08.579 align:start position:0%
example I'll say for third party
 
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
liability is an example that's not
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
something we can house robustly in-house
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
but there are vendors on the market that
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I noticed your
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
budget you had an increase in technology
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
spending as a actual software it sounded
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
like is this this the area that's aimed
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
at that might be your
 
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that's your qio yeah
 
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's probably what that is
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
the qio
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify and you you're
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to account 7935
 
00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
um the technology software class 38
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
oh it says it's Equifax
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
Equifax is that the Equifax uh
 
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
yeah that might be our Equifax contract
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
that we have to use to ID to identify
 
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
people's addresses for our special
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
investigations unit and also for
 
00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.910 align:start position:0%
investigations unit and also for
um

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:20.099 align:start position:0%
uh to identify income for our quality
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
assurance unit yep identify employment
 
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.710 align:start position:0%
assurance unit yep identify employment
um

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's the qio yeah okay and then there
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
is another one which is software
 
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
um for qio which is the what's qio stand
 
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.750 align:start position:0%
um for qio which is the what's qio stand
for

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
quality improvement organization this is
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
a function where we have to review the
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
name is a little confusing it's really a
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
function where we have to review all of
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
the inpatient stays inpatient hospital
 
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
stays and there's a single standardized
 
00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
software that you can use to kind of
 
00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
help you understand does this meet all
 
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
the criteria for an inpatient stay or
 
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
does it not I mean ultimately it comes
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
down to judgment uh and so we have staff
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
who are helping make that judgment but
 
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
there is a standardized software you use
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
to make that determination so it's like
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
um so I didn't quite hear a yes with the
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
funding that you have are requesting in
 
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
that line is is that the money that you
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
need to address this weakness that
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
you've identified thank you no it's not
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
it's continuation of current operations
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
outline some detail of the work of the
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
and is outlined here in the bullets the
 
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
bureau includes our special
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
investigations unit
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
which does the uh
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
referrals for fraud for beneficiaries
 
00:42:03.849 --> 00:42:03.859 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid Program Integrity unit
 
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
which does investigations for fraud
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid providers not beneficiaries
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
but providers
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid provider enrollment unit
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
that enrolls Medicaid providers
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
and our Medicaid third party liability
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
unit that does cost avoidance so that
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is the pair of Last Resort and
 
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
cost recoveries
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
and the Medicaid Program Integrity unit
 
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
and third party liability unit also in
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
addition to doing that work on behalf of
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
the FIFA service populations they also
 
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
do the oversight of the mco's work that
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
they're doing in those respects for the
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
Managed Care population so the con it's
 
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
kind of contract management of our mcos
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
that work is equal to or greater than
 
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
probably the work we do for fee for
 
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.870 align:start position:0%
probably the work we do for fee for
service

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
we also have the quality assurance unit
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
they do federally required audits of
 
00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:58.700 align:start position:0%
snap eligibility determinations
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutritional Access program
 
00:43:01.619 --> 00:43:02.329 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutritional Access program
um

00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes called food stamps but the
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
snap program eligibility determinations
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
that the department does we're federally
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
required to take a sub-sample of those
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
and make sure that they were done
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
correctly and the right allotment was
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
given out
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
and the financial Compliance Unit does
 
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.150 align:start position:0%
and the financial Compliance Unit does
um

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
reviews and audits of nursing home cost
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
reports they do sub-recipient monitoring
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
for vendors that receive federal funds
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
they do Medicaid to schools audits
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
am I missing anything
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
they do all the federal audits oh and
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
they do all of the liaising for federal
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
audits so our single audit which is our
 
00:43:41.569 --> 00:43:41.579 align:start position:0%
our largest Federal audit they do the
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
liaising between the program areas and
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
the Auditors but they would do that for
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
any specific Federal audit that we get
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
are are and then internal audit of
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
course um as I as is exactly how it's
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
described internal audit would do an
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
audit of the department at Management's
 
00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.970 align:start position:0%
audit of the department at Management's
discretion

00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
so any questions on the Bureau of
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative stream so it looks like
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
you'll recover about two million dollars
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
a year where does that money go uh in
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
that just stay in your apartment or
 
00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:17.579 align:start position:0%
total total so uh the portion that is
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
returned that is federal funds goes back
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
to the federal government and these are
 
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
mostly Medicaid monies or or uh snap
 
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
money snaps 100 Federal and then
 
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is a mix of federal in general
 
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
those would go back be returned to the
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
federal government and the portion that
 
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
is General funds goes into revenues for
 
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
the general fund so it does not stay in
 
00:44:40.569 --> 00:44:40.579 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues
 
00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:46.619 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow-up um and and
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
that's where the 30 plus employees
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
reside from your earlier chart
 
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.530 align:start position:0%
reside from your earlier chart
um

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:53.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
this Bureau actually has 71. okay well
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
all of those are in here okay thank you
 
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.370 align:start position:0%
all of those are in here okay thank you
yeah

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
any other questions go ahead
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
I guess first of all just to clarify we
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
have my qai
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
operations no
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not in the wrong place on the budget
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
briefing book or qai is probably the
 
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
6637 it's oh I I actually oh that's it
 
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
yes 79.35 is the accounting unit and I I
 
00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
apologize the names have changed so they
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
don't always align but I think you're
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
looking are you looking at the budget
 
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
this book
 
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
budget narrative I'm not trying to
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
budget but quality the yeah sorry the
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book quality assurance
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
and Improvement
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
you haven't gotten there yet
 
00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
back and forth between documents while
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
you're done it's good it's all good in
 
00:46:01.079 --> 00:46:01.849 align:start position:0%
you're done it's good it's all good in
the

00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know if you're in the
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
budget or our budget in the budget
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
budgeting book in the budget budget okay
 
00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:09.740 align:start position:0%
so the one we are describing right now
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
is on page 1076 of the budget I'll go
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
back yep and it's uh accounting unit
 
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
79.35 you got it okay yeah that's also
 
00:46:23.089 --> 00:46:23.099 align:start position:0%
if you the cheat sheet is at the bottom
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
of these
 
00:46:24.839 --> 00:46:26.750 align:start position:0%
of these
um slides

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
um slides
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
got it got it okay
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh so on slide 15 is a a chart that just
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
shows what's happening with a couple of
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
our recoveries uh as you can see our
 
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
fraud wasted abuse recoveries have been
 
00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:41.339 align:start position:0%
increasing our TPL recoveries have been
 
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
declining that's okay because what's
 
00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:47.099 align:start position:0%
happening is that the mcos a lot of the
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
TPL work has been shifted to the mcos so
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
they do that recovery for fraud waste
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
and abuse where it's a fraud case the
 
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
mcos cannot keep the recovery the state
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
keeps the recovery those get referred
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
over to the doj and and pursued by the
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
doj and so the recoveries are kept by
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
and if you go to slide 16 the Bureau of
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
there are five units within the bureau
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
including our data analytics and
 
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.030 align:start position:0%
including our data analytics and
Reporting

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
Reporting
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
and data analytics and Reporting is
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
focused really on Medicaid data
 
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
analytics and Reporting so they uh
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
manage all of our mmis Medicaid
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
management information systems data and
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
they use that for the purposes of of all
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of things understanding
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
demographics understanding rates
 
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.450 align:start position:0%
demographics understanding rates
um

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
and within that unit is the a subunit
 
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
which manages the mqis the Medicaid
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
quality information system website that
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
I referenced earlier
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
there's also the Medicaid quality
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
program which is federally mandated for
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
us to have a Managed Care Quality
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
strategy so that strategy is written and
 
00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
managed within that unit and that's
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
where we sort of set priorities for the
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program and then we hold our
 
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
Managed Care
 
00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.030 align:start position:0%
Managed Care
organizations

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
accountable for achieving some of that
 
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.410 align:start position:0%
accountable for achieving some of that
quality

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:26.420 align:start position:0%
quality
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
the substance misuse planning and
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation unit is a unit of one
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
individual who is a subject matter
 
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
expert in substance misuse and really
 
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
understands nationally uh what happens
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
both within Clinical Services but also
 
00:48:43.859 --> 00:48:44.510 align:start position:0%
both within Clinical Services but also
um

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
an outcome
 
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
measures and the intended outcomes of
 
00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:53.099 align:start position:0%
substance misuse services and so he
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
works very closely both with our
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid quality program to help set
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
some of those metrics and he also works
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
with our Bureau of drug and alcohol
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
Services directly to help manage their
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
vendors who are non-medicaid
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
our health services assessment unit does
 
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.829 align:start position:0%
our health services assessment unit does
uh

00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
intensive Clinical Services audits of a
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
number of our providers they monitor the
 
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers in
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
compliance with the Community Mental
 
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
Health agreement they monitor CFI
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
providers and they work with other
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
program areas to develop similar sort of
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
Deep dive Clinical Services reviews so
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they can go into providers and make
 
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
sure they're providing services that
 
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
meet our standards and are in compliance
 
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
with our administrative rules
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then our contracts quality
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
management unit is the new one that that
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
I described earlier that is working with
 
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
all the program areas across the
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
department in order to set up
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
performance metrics they can use to
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
and this oh
 
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.750 align:start position:0%
and this oh
share

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
I think she caught up with me
 
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
um so this this is what I was asking the
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
question and it is qai
 
00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:11.390 align:start position:0%
question and it is qai
right

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
q a operation yes in the yes the
 
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
accounting unit title yes is quality
 
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
assurance and Improvement operation so
 
00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:20.099 align:start position:0%
page 1091 of your budget of the budget
 
00:50:20.099 --> 00:50:21.050 align:start position:0%
page 1091 of your budget of the budget
yes

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:50:22.849 --> 00:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
yes it looks like you're adding a person
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
or maybe more I'm just
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
curious as whether or not you what the
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
likelihood is that you can hire that one
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
or more people sure so so it's actually
 
00:50:34.089 --> 00:50:34.099 align:start position:0%
being transferred from accounting units
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
7935. you'll you'll see a one FTE
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
and on the next slide or the next couple
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
slides I think I just have a couple
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
examples uh of some of the work
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
being done in the Bureau of program
 
00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.109 align:start position:0%
being done in the Bureau of program
quality

00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
quality
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
so on slide 17 you will see some of the
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
priority performance measures that the
 
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
department had selected that the
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services had selected working
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
with our chief medical officer to
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
prioritize and really try to highlight
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
in our most recent round of Managed Care
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
contracts so there are areas around
 
00:51:20.819 --> 00:51:21.609 align:start position:0%
contracts so there are areas around
um

00:51:21.609 --> 00:51:21.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
perinatal care around uh adult care
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
around and a few related to child care
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
so so Children's Health including
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
immunizations weight assessment and
 
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.069 align:start position:0%
immunizations weight assessment and
counseling

00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
um and there's another one first line
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
use of first line psychosocial care for
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
children and adolescents on
 
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.790 align:start position:0%
children and adolescents on
antipsychotics

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
antipsychotics
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
so because it's the top one let me ask
 
00:51:50.809 --> 00:51:50.819 align:start position:0%
on the chlamydia screening it the goal
 
00:51:50.819 --> 00:51:52.089 align:start position:0%
on the chlamydia screening it the goal
is

00:51:52.089 --> 00:51:52.099 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:56.660 align:start position:0%
61.7 percent is is that's
 
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
61.7 percent of all women on receiving a
 
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.210 align:start position:0%
61.7 percent of all women on receiving a
Medicaid

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
benefit is that what that 61 percent of
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
I think it is the national Medicaid
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the next page uh slide
 
00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:23.569 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the next page uh slide
18

00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
timeliness of prenatal care
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
you'll see the New Hampshire Medicaid
 
00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:30.059 align:start position:0%
Trend and this is this is exactly the
 
00:52:32.569 --> 00:52:32.579 align:start position:0%
kind of information you'll see on the
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
mqis the Medicaid quality information
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
system website you'll see charts just
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
like this you can click into each of
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
these uh measures and be able to see a
 
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
chart just like this one
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
and in this case the definition of
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
timeliness of prenatal care you'll see
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
at the bottom the measure definition the
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
percentage of deliveries that received a
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
prenatal care visit as a member of the
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
organization in the first trimester or
 
00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
within 42 days of enrollment in the
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Organization and the
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
comparator here for 2021 it says it's a
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
82.1 percent and then the national
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Managed Care 75th percentile
 
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
for 2021 was 89.3 so if we go back to
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
the prior page timeliness of prenatal
 
00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.990 align:start position:0%
the prior page timeliness of prenatal
care

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.710 align:start position:0%
 
0.8

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:29.099 align:start position:0%
of course those don't quite match so I
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
am going to double check that for you
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
okay I I was just I'm sort of still
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
curious on the on the previous page said
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
that we've accomplished 48 of the
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
screenings with a target of 61.7 percent
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious what the population
 
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
is that we're considering are we
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
considering every woman on receiving a
 
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefit is that what that 61 of
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
those are only in the Managed Care
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
population okay this reflection so all
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
that data would come through the Managed
 
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
Care organizations it's in our encounter
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
data for these women and these are
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
nationally reported hedis metrics so
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
so if they if the woman gets true uh
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
um services from a family planning
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
clinic or a federally qualified Health
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
Clinic is that is that data portable in
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
a way in which we have visibility of
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
who's getting what screening it wouldn't
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
matter which provider provided the
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
screening it is so the data itself is
 
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
portable it dumps into a single database
 
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:37.790 align:start position:0%
portable it dumps into a single database
somewhere

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
yeah we would have access to which of
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
the women received that service
 
00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
regardless of what provider they
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
received it at
 
00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:47.150 align:start position:0%
received it at
okay

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
so that's not part of the I.T problem
 
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to solve no no okay
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
are you are you close to wrapped up yes
 
00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
okay so there was a slide you and I
 
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
talked about and I'm just curious if you
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
don't think the slide's necessary or or
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're still working on it it was the
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
kind of the the 10-year snapshot I'm
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
back to the 10-year plan and you're
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
either in year two or three but you're
 
00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:16.140 align:start position:0%
you're not near your tenure do you have
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
a sort of a 10-year view of where we're
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
sure but this would get us through years
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
three and four of a 10-year plan
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
if if you're currently in year two and
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get out to year 10 then
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
this two-year budget would cover years
 
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
three and four
 
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
and and just to clarify you you're
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
partly referring to what uh the
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner was talking about when she
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
was talking about her road map and that
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
a road map was just for the initial kind
 
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
of 12-month period
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
no this is an ongoing conversation that
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
must tell us and I have had for a year
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
and a half I think I think it's it's
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
Department wide I I think what you're
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
curious about though is Department wide
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
right metrics that would be used to
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
Across the department in all program
 
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
areas and and that would help Future
 
00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:16.940 align:start position:0%
Finance committees right to know
 
00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
what are the metrics associated with
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
what kind of resourcing we should invest
 
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
based on the workload that would be one
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
set of metrics the other would be are
 
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
there quality metrics in these internal
 
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
programs so that we know whether or not
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
So within the the budget briefing books
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
um that have been provided we did add
 
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
and and this is a new feature we we did
 
00:56:47.329 --> 00:56:47.339 align:start position:0%
add into into many of those sections
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
um performance metrics now there as as
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
you know and as as Meredith and you have
 
00:56:53.819 --> 00:56:55.309 align:start position:0%
you know and as as Meredith and you have
discussed

00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
00:56:57.049 --> 00:56:57.059 align:start position:0%
um you know there there's no today
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's no centralized result based
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
accountability type of metric system or
 
00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
or unified logic model but there are
 
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
different indicators across every
 
00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
Division and every
 
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
um program area that that can be used as
 
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
as metrics but but there there's also in
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
the agency budget request there's the
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
Form B which has which has some of those
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
metrics and and that form is issued by
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
the Department administrative Services
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's required
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
um under rsa9 as part of the part of the
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
annual budget process
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
um but but what we've tried to do at
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
least initially for this cycle is
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
include within those briefing books
 
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
um those performance metrics that can at
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
least begin to lay the foundation for
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
for specifically what you're talking
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
about or we have the better perfect
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
logic model where you can see here's my
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
dollars here's my outcome here's the
 
00:57:56.809 --> 00:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
output what's this costing what's the
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
ratio what's the funding mix associated
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
so in the
 
00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:08.339 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book for Bureau of
 
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
program Integrity on page 10. you'll see
 
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
an example this is what you would see in
 
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
the form B for every accounting unit as
 
00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.089 align:start position:0%
the form B for every accounting unit as
well

00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
actually I shouldn't say this by
 
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
accounting unit level it might be by
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
activity level so at a slightly higher
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
level in The Form B there would be this
 
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
exactly this type of form with these
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
sort of outcome intended output intended
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
outcome baselines and goals
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
and that will be in the entire budget
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
briefing book
 
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
go ahead so just to follow up on that
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
great this is what we've been looking at
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
but what we haven't seen is the results
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
so I guess in that 10-year plan we're
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
talking about it that's where I was
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
hoping it was less than that but
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
whatever it is when will we start seeing
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
that side of the equation
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
just ballpark Madison from day and month
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
yep and and I know I totally understand
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
when the Formby was originally rolled
 
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
out some of us asked the same question
 
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
oh this is very interesting you can
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
always see where people are aiming and
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
you never exactly see where they've come
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
from so completely understand it I don't
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
know that we have a mechanism to do that
 
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I I mean I've I've seen I I
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
formally worked in another state and
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
they they had a smart program for every
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
area across the department and it
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
tracked it had those performance metrics
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
across every division every Bureau
 
00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:32.339 align:start position:0%
within that state and you you had year
 
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
one where you established your Baseline
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
you had year two three four and whatnot
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
and then you had your target metrics
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
um I guess that's one challenge with the
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
existing budget system budget process
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
that we do have where we don't
 
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily have that history
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
um again this is sort of my first
 
00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
go-around in this role and that and and
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
I think by establishing these within
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
this budget briefing book I mean it's
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
it's my long-term intent to continue to
 
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
try to build off of that so that we have
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
that history and that record in in one
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
single location
 
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
so just uh I've heard our chairman speak
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
about this 10 unit plan
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
are you guys is this part of what you
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
could what you guys have been talking
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
about so that within this tenure plan
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
we'd expect to see that because that's
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
sort of when I hear him when I hear him
 
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
say that what I hear is that's what
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to get so I'm just wondering
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
if we're all on the same page or if I'm
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
I think one of the one of the challenges
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
currently is
 
01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
um our our commissioner is is in an
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
interim role for the next year um she
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
chose not to to start a four or five
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
year type strategic plan but instead the
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
the the the one-year plan to get things
 
01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.490 align:start position:0%
the the the one-year plan to get things
moving

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
um to address many of the key priorities
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
that she's identified so I think within
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
you know within the coming year I mean
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
that that will kind of be the price one
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
of the key drivers behind many many of
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
the sort of resource devotions that um
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
or allocations you know that that we
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
will be moving towards but but I think
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
one of the complexities is that it you
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
know when when Trisha Tilley comes in
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
next week for Public Health
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
she has many federal grants she has many
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
performance indicators she is a team of
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
folks that focus on data to get to the
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
point to have the unified system I think
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
that's where you know it would be
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
beneficial for for us to go I I think
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's also just important to recognize
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
the tremendous amount of resources and
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
and I.T systems and data systems and
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
Reporting metrics and analysts that that
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
would be required to get us there
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
um so I I think we'd probably have to go
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
back and have a longer conversation with
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
a commissioner
 
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
um about about how this could be be
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
woven into the
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
um you know the the 12-month road map
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
that that is in the process of being
 
01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:03.170 align:start position:0%
that that is in the process of being
implemented

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and I think it would be good though
 
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.329 align:start position:0%
um and I think it would be good though
if

01:02:11.329 --> 01:02:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
if we could flesh out what what it you
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
know what kind of time frame this is on
 
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
um you know because then certainly I
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
think within 10 years you ought to be
 
01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:20.579 align:start position:0%
able to do this uh if and if not we
 
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
should know that because it is really
 
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
hard to sit through these briefings and
 
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.549 align:start position:0%
hard to sit through these briefings and
uh

01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
year after year and many many years
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
after sometimes decades after decades
 
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.549 align:start position:0%
after sometimes decades after decades
and

01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
not be able to actually see it how
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
effective are these programs is it
 
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
really should we be spending this money
 
01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
here or should we be spending it over
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
there uh kind of a thing
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
um so really nice to know if you guys
 
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
are and I get it I understand the
 
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.450 align:start position:0%
are and I get it I understand the
commissioners

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
you know only thinking a year ahead but
 
01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if there's not that
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
the plan is in place but that we're
 
01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%
thinking about having such a plan
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
I think that's sort of what the chairman
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
I don't want to speak for the chairman
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
but you did it better than I did so
 
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
speak for me anytime
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll we'll keep talking
 
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
about it I I understand that the
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner's focus on the next year I
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
got it all right thank you thank you any
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative hole do you have any
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
questions you want to share any jokes
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
with us or
 
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.730 align:start position:0%

Information Services this is great two
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%

good afternoon my name is David Wieters
 
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee Dennis
 
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
Goulet the commissioner for the
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
so I'll try to be as brief as possible
 
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
to get us out on time but also give you
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
as much information as you have and
 
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
answer your questions as the best I can
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you for having me
 
01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
the information Services Bureau is
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
really here to collaborate and identify
 
01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.910 align:start position:0%
really here to collaborate and identify
opportunities

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
within our organization to really
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
integrate technology with a focus on
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
empowering those employees and the
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
individuals that we serve to in a secure
 
01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
and data-driven environment to deliver
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
our services so that you'll find that on
 
01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
slide I think that was slide 19. it's
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
where we're starting and then moving on
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
to the next slide it's really some of
 
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
our our goals and what we're trying to
 
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
do so with technology and in partnership
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
with the information technology
 
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
department we're looking to provide
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
seamless and efficient individual care
 
01:04:53.569 --> 01:04:53.579 align:start position:0%
services at the point of care without
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
unnecessary duplication or delay
 
01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
and that sort of finds itself in lots of
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
our different systems across the
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
services and programs that we deliver
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
but the key highlight that we're working
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
on right now and we'll be continuing
 
01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
into the next biennium is care
 
01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
coordination via Statewide networks for
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
service referrals care plans and event
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
notifications for Missions discharge and
 
01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.410 align:start position:0%
notifications for Missions discharge and
transfers

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
so there's some contracts in play right
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
now that will be moving forward we
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
already have an event notification
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
system that we're rolling out and
 
01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
expanding the network and then we're
 
01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
moving towards a closed-loop referral
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
system and some of you may have been
 
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:35.540 align:start position:0%
part of legislation in the last session
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
associated with that and our goal is to
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
make sure it is maintains the privacy
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
and the security of the information that
 
01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
we're containing with informed consent
 
01:05:47.329 --> 01:05:47.339 align:start position:0%
with each individual as they use those
 
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
systems so we really are trying to
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
listen to our individuals in our state
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
as well as the legislature to empower
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
and build these integrative Solutions as
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative irf for a question thank
 
01:06:05.569 --> 01:06:05.579 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman Madam chair
 
01:06:07.609 --> 01:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
so regarding that since you brought it
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
up so forthrightly in addition to
 
01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.849 align:start position:0%
up so forthrightly in addition to
privacy

01:06:12.849 --> 01:06:12.859 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
the system as it was being discussed at
 
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
one point was very Broad in terms of
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
extending Beyond Medicaid
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
People to non-medicate People
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering that's still the case
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
and if so are those folks aware are they
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
able to choose to opt in and opt out
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
when they want to if they have opted in
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
if you follow where I'm going with this
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
certainly um thank you very much for the
 
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
question representative erf the new
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
solution is certainly going to be broad
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
for different services not just Medicaid
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
services and health care services but
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
also Social Services as as they operate
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
but the individuals will be able to opt
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
in to that through a consent process to
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
in to know who who they're sharing their
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
information with and for why and then of
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
course have the option to remove that
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
consent if they so choose as they go
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
through the the process so if someone
 
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
was up at a housing supports
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
organization and was getting a referral
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
for mental health services that you
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
would be presented with that type of
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
consent document saying we're sharing
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
your information with XYZ Mental Health
 
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.569 align:start position:0%
your information with XYZ Mental Health
Center

01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:23.579 align:start position:0%
Center
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
to provide these Services is this
 
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
something that you would like and if
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
they so choose to say yes and sign they
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
would be provided that referral if they
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
say no they could then opt into a
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
different solution of saying but you can
 
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
call them for me or you can email them
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
for me or you can provide me the
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
information so there'll be lots of
 
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
different Alternatives so we have really
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
tried to address that accessibility as
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
well as the privacy and security
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
component follow-up follow up thank you
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
very much for that Clarity that's really
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
great to hear
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:58.569 --> 01:07:58.579 align:start position:0%
so on on some of the are we good
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely please continue Mr readers
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
thank you so the other goal is to
 
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
provide better services for individuals
 
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
and drive improved outcomes through
 
01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:08.339 align:start position:0%
enhanced decision making and
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
productivity and this really flows into
 
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
many different components of Information
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
Services one is data portal so you'll
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
probably hear about data in many
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
different presentations including
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
program quality and integrity but we're
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
looking to provide secure and price and
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
privacy oriented internal and external
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
Solutions through a managed data
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
governance process
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
with the goals of being able to
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
streamline and be able to track and do
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
some of these Services over time it does
 
01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
take a lot of work to build the
 
01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
foundations and because of different
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
privacy laws and security laws or
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding our data sometimes we're not
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
able to do that and that's for our
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
individuals and our and the services
 
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
that we offer not always can we combine
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
that information so that also puts some
 
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
some delays in working that through but
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
we're gold at building those data
 
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
portals to really utilize that
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
information to provide better data
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
driven data-driven decision making
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
and then moving into some of the
 
01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
accessibility components we're looking
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
for mobile mobile and self-service
 
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:19.259 align:start position:0%
options for our systems so many of our
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
systems have been around for two three
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
decades prior to the invention of the
 
01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
the iPhone or the Android and they
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
weren't really as mobile friendly at
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
that time so we're trying to modernize
 
01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
those systems as we go forward with each
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
individual program as as applicable and
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
then the last one that we're really
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
focusing on this next biennium is
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
project and resource management
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
and that that's really establishing in
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
our project management structure so that
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
we have an intake in inventory and be
 
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
able to start aligning it to what Nathan
 
01:09:57.169 --> 01:09:57.179 align:start position:0%
explained earlier the 12-month roadmap
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then on and Beyond as we get a
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
full-time commissioner we're hoping that
 
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
we would be able to continue that
 
01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.490 align:start position:0%
we would be able to continue that
function

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
and then our last goal here is reduce
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of operating the core
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
Services extending the capacity of the
 
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
agency and how does Information Services
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
play into that it's really looking at
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
the technology platforms and seeing do
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
we have opportunities to look at the
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
different programs and when I say
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
programs in this case like software
 
01:10:26.649 --> 01:10:26.659 align:start position:0%
programs and do we need to buy
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
individualized ones for every service
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
that we provide or can we leverage what
 
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
we call like economies of scale or a
 
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
single system that can provide multiple
 
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
different functions for the environment
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
and we we've landed on
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
many different areas but one of them one
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
of them is Salesforce which you'll hear
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
in many of our conversations another one
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
is our Enterprise business intelligence
 
01:10:54.169 --> 01:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
platform which follows a very rigid
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
um not rigid but
 
01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
well-documented data governance process
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
so this this goal in Dennis time in
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
whenever you want to is to really
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
improve the utilization of our patient
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
client system and provider systems to
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
really address that reporting the
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
payment processing the relationship
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
management sometimes you'll hear in I.T
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
we call it case management but in
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
healthcare case management means
 
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
something very different than in it so
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
we're calling it relationship management
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
here to distinguish it separately
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
um collaboration and Provider Services
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
through consolidation and integration so
 
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a lot of work I'll
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
just bring up a little bit later there
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
was a question during the program
 
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
quality and integrity regarding what are
 
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
the I.T systems that are out there and
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
one of them was the third priority
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
liability system that is on our Medicaid
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
enterprise system strategy of
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
reprocuring that system to have a
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
specified contract for third-party
 
01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:02.060 align:start position:0%
liabilities so you'll see a lot of
 
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
synergies between Information Services
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
and our different divisions within this
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
within the department in many cases
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
we are working on that but it's not
 
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
something as simple as just go out and
 
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
get the vendor implement it needs to be
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
part of an overarching stack strategy
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
I'll stop for a moment because I see a
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
question go ahead
 
01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
um looking at the actual budget under
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
item 046 Consultants that was at zero
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
last budget and now it's in at 525 000.
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
can you just explain what that is is
 
01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
that an attempt to bridge some Workforce
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
so the page should be on I think you're
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then under 046 Consultants what we
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
are trying to do
 
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
with additional workforces through
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
through the last several years but even
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
prior to that it's difficult to acquire
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
um resources in I.T specific fields and
 
01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.930 align:start position:0%
um resources in I.T specific fields and
so

01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
in in historic historically government
 
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
has outsourced a lot of that work into
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
Consultants or Professional Services so
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
we are looking to increase our our
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
Consultants so that we can really staff
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
those teams to be effective at
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
delivering Medicaid enterprise system
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
strategies delivering our electronic
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
visit verification system that we're
 
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
moving forward moving forward with
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
better federal reporting components
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
supporting pqi the list goes on and on
 
01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
we have well over 100 projects that we
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
need to Resource but we don't have well
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
over a hundred people that answers my
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions since she got to
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
the budget page
 
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:03.830 align:start position:0%
the budget page
um

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
I'm impressed that the general funds
 
01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
really didn't change much and the
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds took a huge jump I just
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
want to make you want to speak to how
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're getting all that great I don't
 
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
want to say free money but big load of
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
I I mean I I would likely have to go
 
01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:25.850 align:start position:0%
I I mean I I would likely have to go
through

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
um line by line to really that wasn't a
 
01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
critical week to the specifics that's
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
fine I I mean basically we're able to
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
better effectively leverage federal
 
01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
dollars good job
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's really what I wanted to say a
 
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
more general question I think it was
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
this group that recently spoke to us or
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
even to the larger group your new your
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
new Medicaid system was supposed to roll
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
out or is rolling out soon is that
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
what's the status of that
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so we are in
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
the process so we've been going through
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
a discovery in basically requirements
 
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
Gathering phase for the last I would say
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
year a little over a year and really
 
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
working with different states CMS as
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
well as our our professional Consultants
 
01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
that we hired to help us to come up with
 
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
that roadmap so we do have a roadmap and
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
then we're releasing two requests for
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
proposals in the next probably two to
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
three months to start that reprocurement
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
but it is a five-year project and so we
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate starting we have a roadmap
 
01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
published that we can share that is
 
01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
public information so maybe I'm
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
referring to the wrong system is there
 
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
some pretty large system that either was
 
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
posted on the last few weeks or in the
 
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
next few weeks
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that that essentially
 
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
there was two components of our
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
stabilization of our Medicaid management
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
information system
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the first one was that system was
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
implemented in 2005 with the hardware
 
01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
and software being owned by the state
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
and then subsequent to that we did not
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
fund the life cycle replacement of that
 
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
Hardware so it was essentially 18 years
 
01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:06.620 align:start position:0%
old and we the state funded a capital
 
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
investment to replace that hardware and
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
software to stabilize the Medicaid
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
management information system which we
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
went live two weeks ago with no no real
 
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
issues we had two bugs after we went
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
live that were remediated no impacts on
 
01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
providers no impacts on claims
 
01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:27.229 align:start position:0%
providers no impacts on claims
processing

01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
processing
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
there was a massive effort I was really
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
proud of the team for the work that they
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
so sitting here it reminds me I I think
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things I may have been
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
expecting from you Mr White
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
um uh the commissioner had laid out for
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
a very nice top-down structured way of
 
01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
identifying what her priorities were in
 
01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:55.820 align:start position:0%
her one-year road map for Visionary
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
areas 12 of these 30 of these and then
 
01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
by the time it got down to it she said
 
01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
she had a list of like 96 or 97 uh
 
01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
specific initiatives that she wanted to
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
pursue in the next year I think you all
 
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
were going to send me an Excel sheet of
 
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
um and the reason it's relative here
 
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
I'll take a yes on that and uh is that
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
what I what I'm hoping to do is to is to
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
get the it lay down next to those 97
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
initiatives just to just to be able to
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
crosswalk you know her priorities with
 
01:17:39.169 --> 01:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
the I.T priorities
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
because we we still just as recently as
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
this last fiscal committee funded I
 
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
don't know a million dollars on an I.T
 
01:17:50.209 --> 01:17:50.219 align:start position:0%
project that I didn't know where that it
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
project fit in the overall scheme of
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
priorities it was just it just felt like
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
here's another Target of opportunity
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
here's some more money let's go get it
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
but I didn't see where that
 
01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:09.659 align:start position:0%
IT project fit Within the strategy of
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
so um I I I've tried to ask for this a
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
few times I I don't know if I'm asking
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
for something that's just too hard to do
 
01:18:21.649 --> 01:18:21.659 align:start position:0%
or not of any value but but I would like
 
01:18:25.330 --> 01:18:25.340 align:start position:0%
to see the the initiatives and the I.T
 
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
next to each other
 
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
sure and and the roadmap is is nearly
 
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
finalized as the commissioner indicated
 
01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:34.739 align:start position:0%
it's been actively under development so
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
what once that is finalized I will get
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
it to you
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
all right I I guess I guess it's not
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential for us to approve
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
an I.T budget but it does increase the
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
confidence what was 57 million dollars
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we're gonna we're gonna do here in
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
I.T that's that's a lot of money I just
 
01:18:59.630 --> 01:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
would like to see that it's it's um it's
 
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
that that there's an articulated plan
 
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
behind it
 
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:04.910 align:start position:0%
behind it
so

01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
do you have I interrupted you were
 
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
you're still in in mid presentation I
 
01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:11.750 align:start position:0%
you're still in in mid presentation I
bet

01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
bet
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
I I can certainly address that but
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham
 
01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
um maybe along those lines uh you talk
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
about 50 active projects and 30
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
additional projects under review can we
 
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
get a list of those uh and
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
um uh in spreadsheet form or database
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
form uh I have a separate question
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
um uh in any of the output you have
 
01:19:39.130 --> 01:19:39.140 align:start position:0%
um you know whether it's from the manage
 
01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:41.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid managed care providers
 
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
or any other contracts do you get
 
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
requests and provide any access to
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
groups like Optum or things like that
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
that may may want to use that data as
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
part of bigger projects that they're
 
01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
doing and if so is there any revenue
 
01:19:58.729 --> 01:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
so the first question thank you for that
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
question I believe we can provide the
 
01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:08.420 align:start position:0%
list of the projects in an Excel format
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
for the second one I don't know but I
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
can follow up and and see if we're
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
sharing because with specifically to
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
Optum how that might happen we used to
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
subcontract through conduit with Optum
 
01:20:25.209 --> 01:20:25.219 align:start position:0%
for our electronic data interchange
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that conduit
 
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
severed that that contract and now are
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
doing their own EDI transactions for the
 
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:36.659 align:start position:0%
last couple years so I don't know if we
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
have specific Communications with optin
 
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
but we can follow up on it
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
and then just for some clarity regarding
 
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
this Budget on on page 1089 and and 1090
 
01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
for our office of Information Services
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of line items in there
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
especially for the transfers to oit that
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
are for ongoing operations so there's
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
life cycle management of our laptops
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we have here today so we have a
 
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
replacement plan for those we have a
 
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
replacement plan for the servers as well
 
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
as the networks and switches that makes
 
01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
up a lot of those as well as many of the
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
line items from a detail perspective or
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
like to manage the new height system for
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
our integrated eligibility so when
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that transfer to oit
 
01:21:24.239 --> 01:21:25.850 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that transfer to oit
of

01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
what is it 50 million 748 000 and 472
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
dollars the majority of that is
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
operations and although I could tie it
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
to the roadmap it's more of a
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
overarching support in order to be
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
successful with our recruitment we need
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
to have computers and software but it's
 
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
going to be more intangible in terms of
 
01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
that kind of connection
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
where you'll see the tangible
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
connections where we can is when we have
 
01:21:54.169 --> 01:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
actual projects that might be funded
 
01:21:57.169 --> 01:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
from different program areas to align to
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
those roadmap items so as as you go
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
through and and you work with the
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the Nathan white you
 
01:22:06.169 --> 01:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
might not be able to get exactly what
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking for representative
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
Edwards and the committee but we'll do
 
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
our best
 
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to provide the clarity
 
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219 align:start position:0%
this is our operations budget to keep
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the lights on and there's not a lot in
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
here that's fluffed to support future
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
initiatives the future initiatives are
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
in I think some of our prioritized needs
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
that may that Nathan might be addressing
 
01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
here in a moment for hb2
 
01:22:30.179 --> 01:22:32.149 align:start position:0%
here in a moment for hb2
but

01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
sure and and
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I I believe
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
um the LBA had provided you with the
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill Appropriations uh document
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
it was it was dated 221-23 and um there
 
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
are two two hb2 Provisions in there
 
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
um one one for 1.5 million dollars that
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
funds the it Consultants to manage
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
projects and perform the analysis and
 
01:22:59.570 --> 01:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
and then and then there was a concurrent
 
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
um provision for 1.95 million and that
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
was to fund the I.T Consultants to
 
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement automated
 
01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
Solutions so one is design one is
 
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
implementation I I know that you will be
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
seeing those once the once hb2 is
 
01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:18.550 align:start position:0%
seeing those once the once hb2 is
released

01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.729 --> 01:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
for historical sake was it two terms ago
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
or three terms ago where the I.T budget
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
and DHHS was really cut way way back and
 
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
it it's taken it it took us at least a
 
01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
term to get you standing again where are
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
we at relative to to that
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
sorry from my perspective when I started
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
in May of 2018 the the budget for 1920
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
and 2021 was severely reduced to
 
01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
basically keep the lights on and nothing
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
else to the point that we didn't replace
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
computers for a year and a half almost
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
two years and then
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
in this this biennium this current
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
biennium we started to recover but we
 
01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
actually certainly need more funds to be
 
01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
able to continue this services that we
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
implemented during this last biennium
 
01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
especially with the pandemic that we
 
01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
worked with um doit where they
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
implemented Microsoft teams and expanded
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
different services that really enable us
 
01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
to do that more efficient telework as
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
well as on-site hybrid meetings with our
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
partners as well as our staff but we
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
also implemented Salesforce which
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
enabled us to bring on a better child
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
care licensing and registry program
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid quality leverages it our public
 
01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
health is leveraging it to do infectious
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
disease management so those tools have
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
increased our our actual transfers to
 
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
oit and that's where you see these bumps
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
from like the 45 million in 2023
 
01:25:03.610 --> 01:25:03.620 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized and the 2024
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
recommended where they're paying for
 
01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:08.420 align:start position:0%
those license expenditures that we have
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to support those Solutions so
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to share that quick
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
thumbnail history with the newer members
 
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee that and to let you
 
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
know that in general I'm in favor and
 
01:25:24.290 --> 01:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
support a robust I.T capability to
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
support management two terms ago
 
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
it I I wasn't part of it but it was I I
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
think a really a major setback to the
 
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
organization to take two years off from
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
I.T planning and development and
 
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
implementation and then we're still sort
 
01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
of I think catching up and gaining
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
getting our feet under our ground and
 
01:25:48.169 --> 01:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
really running that the things I'm
 
01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
asking for I think will help defend your
 
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
budget this year and in coming years if
 
01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
we can show a correlation between the
 
01:25:59.930 --> 01:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner's requirements and
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
priorities and and what we're doing from
 
01:26:05.689 --> 01:26:05.699 align:start position:0%
an I.T perspective to to to to make it
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
happen so I'm I'm trying to be helpful
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
in that regard but are there any other
 
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
questions here do you have more for us
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
Mr wieders we were getting kind of close
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
to the end of this right
 
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
absolutely I I was going to unless you
 
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
want to go into depth on the org chart
 
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to you if you want me to go
 
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
into more detail but we have 19
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
positions we have several vacant we are
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
actively recruiting them and moving that
 
01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:34.460 align:start position:0%
forward I'm going to go ahead and Skip
 
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
essentially to a slide 23
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
and we started discussing our accounting
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
unit 9540 5952 which was on page 1089
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
starting on page 1089 of the budget book
 
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
and I would I would essentially
 
01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
highlight as we already did the transfer
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
to Oat is where the majority of that of
 
01:27:02.209 --> 01:27:02.219 align:start position:0%
the information Services budget lies and
 
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
so we we work we work with doit to
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
develop that line item budget and we
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
essentially transfer that funding over
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
to them but they they essentially
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
purchase on our behalf and Implement
 
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
with us these the different Hardware
 
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
software Solutions and Consulting
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
Services as well as some training for
 
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
their staff and our staff to be
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
effective at leveraging those new
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
technologies if we if we buy them or
 
01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
upgrades so in many cases you upgrade
 
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
the technology it changes the the entire
 
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
look and feel we need to actually train
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
our staff as well so
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want to go line by
 
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
line or if I'm seeing a nod to move on
 
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
from there
 
01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.350 align:start position:0%
from there
so

01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
as we
 
01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
wrap up on from Ikea accomplishments
 
01:27:57.290 --> 01:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
perspective on slide 24 from a
 
01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
department-wide perspective as I
 
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
referred earlier we have the sales price
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
Salesforce Enterprise agreement and what
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's really enabled us to do is we're
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
licensed in a step up perspective so we
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
license the whole department to be able
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
to use it but we're paying for it
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
incrementally over the next several
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
years and we negotiated that because we
 
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
knew we weren't going to be able to
 
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
implement solutions for everyone in the
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
department to use it right up front but
 
01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
we knew in three years we would be able
 
01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:25.790 align:start position:0%
we knew in three years we would be able
to

01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
but that we started with Medicaid
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
quality Public Health contact tracing
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
and investigation the child care
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
registry and Licensing that referred to
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office uses it and then
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're moving it into long-term supports
 
01:28:40.570 --> 01:28:40.580 align:start position:0%
and services
 
01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
dcyf's capital budget is leveraging the
 
01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
Salesforce environment and then we're
 
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
continuing to expand it to see how it
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
will apply to these different solutions
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
that the programs and services need as a
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
potential platform not a requirement but
 
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
if it fits it alleviates costs as we go
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
and then some of the other areas in
 
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
partnership with doit doit implemented
 
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
Microsoft teams for many functions in
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
our organization and it seems like a
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
small thing but it really empowered our
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
services in a totally different way it
 
01:29:19.810 --> 01:29:19.820 align:start position:0%
allowed our Workforce to be able to work
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
with the people where they're at not
 
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
necessarily having to come have them to
 
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
come to our offices so that teleworking
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
is not just allowing employees to work
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
from home but it's also allowing them to
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
provide services for individuals in the
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
homes like for dcyf in in in where
 
01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
they're at and then
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
as we move that forward we expanded that
 
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
into looking at other collaborative
 
01:29:47.689 --> 01:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
functions like a learning management
 
01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
system and that's going live this
 
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
September where we're going to have a
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
standardized learning management system
 
01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
for professional development and some of
 
01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
these will certainly directly tie into
 
01:29:59.450 --> 01:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
those roadmaps that you're referring to
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
there's uh for some reason I'm
 
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
remembering another department bringing
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
in a learning management solution or is
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
there is there what's the strategy here
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
is there are we going to have one LMS
 
01:30:16.729 --> 01:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
for the state employees or are we going
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
to have a couple lms's depending on
 
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
different departmental requirements I
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
think the the main reason we ended up
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
implementing a separate LMS than the
 
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
Statewide one was the Statewide one was
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
really focused on employees and ours
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
needed to be focused on employees plus
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
our Affiliates or our providers that we
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
work with so we need to train many
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
providers in our state as part of our
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
contracts with them they need to be
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
trained by us on how they perform their
 
01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
services so that they can meet those
 
01:30:49.490 --> 01:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
certain those requirements and the
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
current Statewide solution was not
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
available external and there was no goal
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
to make that an external system so so we
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
do have redundancy in our LMS but that
 
01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough overt business decision
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
so not not yet
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
um we we our Statewide LMS right now is
 
01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
is fairly inadequate we're actually
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
running a kind of a department level
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
open source LMS that administrative
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
Services runs it's their intention to to
 
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:22.010 align:start position:0%
Services runs it's their intention to to
leverage

01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
leverage
 
01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
um the the LMS that's in that's
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
available as as a module in our Erp
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
system but that's down the road some
 
01:31:31.679 --> 01:31:32.570 align:start position:0%
system but that's down the road some
years

01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
so HHS had a need now and I think was
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
able to justify the the use of a a
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
another LMS at this time and and so I
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
think there's a rationalization exercise
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
that has to happen because
 
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:47.950 align:start position:0%
that has to happen because
um

01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
Das is going to implement a Statewide
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
for employees and and so where that
 
01:31:56.209 --> 01:31:56.219 align:start position:0%
lands and you know two or three years
 
01:31:58.129 --> 01:31:58.139 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll work on it and I'll be
 
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.139 align:start position:0%
monitoring both ends of that super and
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
and while you're uh talking about common
 
01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.229 align:start position:0%
and while you're uh talking about common
systems

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
um a key component of what the
 
01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
department needs to do is to recruit and
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's been four years since you and I I
 
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
think really last got into Das and the
 
01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
quality of their uh onboarding and not
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
onboarding but just basic recruiting
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
function to for a stranger from
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or somebody to go into the
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first site and start
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
looking for jobs I I think at that time
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
you said we were using a cheap component
 
01:32:41.649 --> 01:32:41.659 align:start position:0%
that was free and that's why it was
 
01:32:45.129 --> 01:32:45.139 align:start position:0%
marginal at best what are we doing in in
 
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
that area I'm not sure I said that but
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
this is what I remember right you know I
 
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
what can I say I simplify a lot of stuff
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have to review the tapes no I'm
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
just kidding no the uh really what we
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
were using was the front end to as it
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
existed for the infor
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
which is our Erp systems Personnel
 
01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
module and some other website stuff and
 
01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
we're that's improved a lot since then
 
01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
um and then they just um actually are
 
01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
are working on now I uh another leap
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
forward where we're gonna they're gonna
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
start going out to all of the um
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
in all of the places where folks go
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
normally because you don't normally
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
think about going necessarily to an
 
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
entity's website to find jobs you find
 
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
them in these General recruitment areas
 
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
so they're they're shifting so it's
 
01:33:37.129 --> 01:33:37.139 align:start position:0%
really not a tool shift it's a strategy
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
shift making some investments in being
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
online where people are actually going
 
01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
to look for jobs so I think that's
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
actually has a good chance of of having
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
a bigger impact than say spending a lot
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
of time and effort on our own
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
website per se so so that's a service
 
01:33:59.050 --> 01:33:59.060 align:start position:0%
that d-o-r-t is performing for the DHS
 
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
gas is actually doing that the
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
department of personnel inside Das is
 
01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
okay and representative Holt did you
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
have a question I did thank you
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
um looking at these department-wide
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
programs that are being implemented help
 
01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
me to understand how
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
this tracks down to the individual
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
employee right both on training which
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
you were talking about but broader than
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
that right hours dedicated to this
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
project that project timesheet tracking
 
01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
um it's I'm trying to make it not a
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
complex answer but each one of the the
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
way we would track it is by project so
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
Salesforce is just a platform but we
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
would have different projects for that
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
so like a child care registry and
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
Licensing project impacts that that
 
01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
Bureau within economic stability that
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
their focus on Head Start collaboration
 
01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
and child and and it also included
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
Melissa sincere Chief legal counsels
 
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
Division of Child Care light on Bureau
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
of child care licensing and then they
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
would dedicate time to that project to
 
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
identify the requirements do the testing
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
and then validate the implementation
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
that it that it met their needs
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
um as we go through like collaboration
 
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
Microsoft teams we have a small group in
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
DHHS of about four people that are
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
partnering with three or four people at
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
dyt to come up with the communication
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
and the training documents that will
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
then be sent out as a mass communication
 
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
to the whole department for them to
 
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
consume and then of course provide what
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
we call lunch and learns for training
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
where they could join at their
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
at their opportunity to learn those
 
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
systems I would say that one has a
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
lighter touch because and then the
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
learning management system really
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's not training on the learning
 
01:35:55.450 --> 01:35:55.460 align:start position:0%
management system it's really
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
utilizing it in like from Information
 
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
Services our primary our first and
 
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
foremost training that we get out there
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
and track is information security and
 
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
privacy and so we we have an annual
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
compliance for that but our also goal is
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
in working and we just had to release
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
this today
 
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
is to have more of a light touch
 
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
throughout the year so the cyber
 
01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
security group under Dennis is also
 
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
doing that and I don't know why if I
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to touch on that
 
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
um and and then going into that last one
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
the Enterprise business intelligence
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
that one touches every program area
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
because every program area has reports
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
and data analytics that they need to
 
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
provide but Information Services in our
 
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
our budget component of that is really
 
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
the software the services and the the
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
Professional Services and the the doit
 
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
component the infrastructure and we
 
01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
provide it as a tool for the different
 
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
program areas to Leverage The the
 
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
software and so we'll provide the
 
01:36:58.610 --> 01:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
training we'll bring We'll onboard them
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
but then really it comes down to them
 
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
utilizing it to develop the reports or
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
and and create those reports from that
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
system so that you can use it so it it
 
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
sort of becomes part of their day sort
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
of like Word and Excel does and that if
 
01:37:14.689 --> 01:37:14.699 align:start position:0%
we are successful at doing it that's
 
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
what it is it's something that they just
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
use on an everyday basis does that
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.950 align:start position:0%
answer your question
follow-up

01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
um kind of
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking right we're in the business
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
of providing services to the citizens of
 
01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right and at some level
 
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's a case right some mom in
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester that needs help
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
and how do we tie back to this effort
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
over here whether it's overhead in some
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
cases right to your your example of
 
01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:44.699 align:start position:0%
using word or I'm actually working
 
01:37:46.930 --> 01:37:46.940 align:start position:0%
one-on-one with the with the client
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
making sure that these infrastructure
 
01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
and system level things we're putting in
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
place allow for the tracking of that so
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
you know that whatever this case is
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
right this is an effective use of time
 
01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
and making sure that those hooks are
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
into the system-wide things systems that
 
01:38:06.410 --> 01:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
we're putting in place
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay so in and correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
and how you said the statement but the
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
way I translate that is that's what we
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
do with our business analysts our
 
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
business systems analysts work with the
 
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
program areas to understand their needs
 
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
and program areas essentially our
 
01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
conduit to the exists the individuals
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
and families where they're working with
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
the individuals and families and saying
 
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
this mother in Manchester needs XYZ
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
needs child support service payments
 
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
needs snap TANF or whatever it happens
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
to be how do I get this person that and
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
so like if it was snap intent if that
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
caseworker would work with that mother
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
and say let me help you fill out a New
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire easy application
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
um you're going to need your social
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
security number and your birth date and
 
01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:55.139 align:start position:0%
other financial data and I'll help you
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
walk you through that and there's a a
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
public portal so that you can either do
 
01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
it on your own or if you need assistance
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
you can go to a district office or you
 
01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
can call 1-800 ask DHHS and they can
 
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
help you through that process of
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
applying for SNAP and TANF and then it
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
goes through our system the new height
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
system and and develops essentially a
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
case where then a case manager can work
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
through that process with the individual
 
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
if necessary or with our internal staff
 
01:39:28.450 --> 01:39:28.460 align:start position:0%
to result in that snap intent if benefit
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
thank you it's helpful at a certain
 
01:39:38.699 --> 01:39:40.250 align:start position:0%
thank you it's helpful at a certain
level

01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:39:42.169 --> 01:39:42.179 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out how to close
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
the loop on right there's a request from
 
01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
a mom to use your example there's a
 
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
request or my example originally a mom
 
01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
in Manchester who needs some Services
 
01:39:53.450 --> 01:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
right we offer some services
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
we track that those Services were
 
01:39:58.490 --> 01:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
delivered we then look back for whether
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
that Mom continued to need services or
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
this helped her out and she no longer
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
needs Services how do we close the loop
 
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
on there how much we invested some time
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
and money and right is there a way to
 
01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
track any of that or is
 
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
that not capable within the current
 
01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:14.030 align:start position:0%
that not capable within the current
systems

01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
I can go back to that team and see if I
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
can get that answer for you but I don't
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
know the specifics of how that gets
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
closed off or can we track and if I
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
understand you you're trying to say if
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
that mother asks for these services
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
it goes through our system did they get
 
01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
their services and did they did all of
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
their other services get addressed while
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
they go through it and can we actually
 
01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
sort of monetize that is that what
 
01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
you're looking for like in terms of the
 
01:40:43.729 --> 01:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
I.T system supporting it as well exactly
 
01:40:45.649 --> 01:40:45.659 align:start position:0%
the I.T systems that are being put in
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
place can they track the input request
 
01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
to the output and then show that right
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
this F this money that was spent this
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
time that was invested all those that
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
that are the state helping out
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
um are helping this family or in this
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
case this mom and child right get to the
 
01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
point where they're they're
 
01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:06.659 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient or is there ongoing
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
needs and then we close this loop again
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
and that becomes the input for the next
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
budget cycle or the next right the
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
additional program they need
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
I can certainly follow up with a answer
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
to that question or if we don't have a
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
process for that we'll answer that way
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
too okay thank you so it sounds like at
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
least half of it is
 
01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
to be done through that closed loop
 
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
referral system that you guys want out
 
01:41:32.090 --> 01:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
to reacquire that it's it's the way to
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead and take a a client and start
 
01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:39.980 align:start position:0%
to wrap around their services through a
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
closed-loop referral system to where we
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
know a referral has been made and that a
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
referral has been accepted but I think
 
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
the back half of that is sort of
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
something I've never asked you all about
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
and that's what representative hole is
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
asking that's interesting to me is that
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
do we have a way to go and just track
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
the completion of those services or the
 
01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
quality of those services
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
but that's what you just said you're
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to go look at
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent let me give an
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
example right to the to as you were
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
talking about whether the mom in in
 
01:42:17.689 --> 01:42:17.699 align:start position:0%
Manchester needs help filling out the
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
forms and applying for this there's
 
01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
there's an employee who helps walk them
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:25.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
they spend an hour with that and
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
will they need help next time I'm
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
thinking just how to close the loop
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
because as a systems engineer I think
 
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
about we have some request I want to go
 
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
all the way back around and make sure
 
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
that the initial initial request was met
 
01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
that the needs were were addressed
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
understand if we invested time how do we
 
01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.139 align:start position:0%
make this easier next time so that we
 
01:42:51.770 --> 01:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
learn from oh we're seeing a high
 
01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who need help
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
walking through the forums maybe it's
 
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
just the forms aren't intuitive enough
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
and a small tweak to the forms would
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
make this such that we don't need to
 
01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
spend an hour on the phone right this is
 
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
tracking inputs and outputs at a system
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
level for the services provided what to
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
to answer that question directly we do
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
have a process on all of our systems
 
01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
that basically and our caseworkers where
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
they if they get a question and they're
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
following up they they go through and
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
when they close out the case or if they
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
say they're done
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
they basically have provided the
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
services and we have a record of that
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
um so I I but it's every system is that
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
way so we haven't like we don't have a
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
way in which to say
 
01:43:37.850 --> 01:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
for David Wieters that might be getting
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
snapped out of child support payments as
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
well as in a mental health system as
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
well as maybe having a a father that
 
01:43:49.609 --> 01:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
he's providing advocacy for on the
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
elderly adult care system we don't have
 
01:43:54.649 --> 01:43:54.659 align:start position:0%
it crosswalked across all of those
 
01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:56.699 align:start position:0%
partially because of privacy concerns
 
01:43:59.450 --> 01:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
and partially because it's that's a
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
complex component of building it
 
01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
together so it's it's sort of nuanced
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
but we certainly have and you'll
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
probably that question might be that
 
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
specific question might be really well
 
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
posed towards one of the program areas
 
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
like that you'll see next week and and
 
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
other and as you go through the rest of
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
the programs you'll find that it'll be I
 
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
would go back to the other division
 
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
directors to answer those questions on
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
how they close the loop on the services
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up so this is effectively
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
what I would deem low-hanging fruit in
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
terms of program Effectiveness things
 
01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:42.179 align:start position:0%
that are easy to make small changes to
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
go back to the forms write the snap
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
forms and whatever else if someone if
 
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
you find that there's a lot of time
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
invested to help people walk through the
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
forms a small change to the layout of
 
01:44:55.129 --> 01:44:55.139 align:start position:0%
the screens online is a is a highly
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
leveraged investment that makes it
 
01:44:58.850 --> 01:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
easier for everybody is and is effective
 
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking if there's any metrics
 
01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
in place or any data in place that we
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
can sort through to find those things
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
in in this the short answer is and I'll
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
use the the new heights example they do
 
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
monthly releases and it's both for bug
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
fixes as well as enhancements and so
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
every time a caseworker or an individual
 
01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
says hey it would be nice if this form
 
01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
that you have that requires me to put in
 
01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
my birthday 27 times before I get to
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
click submit if you could can I just put
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
it in once I'm not saying that's
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
inaccurate but that I was just using it
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
as an example can you just have can I
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
just put it in once and you just
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
remember it all the way through so that
 
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
you click submit and I only have to
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
remember to put my birthday in once we
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
do have a process for pulling that in
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
and saying okay this is an enhancement
 
01:45:54.290 --> 01:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's impacting a lot of individuals we
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
should update this system and we put it
 
01:45:58.370 --> 01:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
into the release planning
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
so time check uh it's like 246 I want to
 
01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:05.699 align:start position:0%
get us out of here at three so we're now
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the speed rounds uh so fast answers
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
short uh I I know you still have
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
material you want to go over but I'm
 
01:46:18.169 --> 01:46:18.179 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm already jumping to page 26 in
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
your second area about the Enterprise
 
01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
business intelligence platform and I'm
 
01:46:26.649 --> 01:46:26.659 align:start position:0%
gonna ask you some interrelated stuff to
 
01:46:29.689 --> 01:46:29.699 align:start position:0%
what we're doing to support the
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board to
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that when they go and do data
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
queries to bring sensitive business
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
information in that
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
it's going into our systems in a way in
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
which we've got a common platform that
 
01:46:50.689 --> 01:46:50.699 align:start position:0%
we can begin to do the data analysis and
 
01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
data queries from are we are we are we
 
01:46:55.129 --> 01:46:55.139 align:start position:0%
developing that plan around the
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability boards
 
01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
data requests that are coming or are
 
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
they yet to be integrated into your
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
plans for the business intelligence
 
01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.629 align:start position:0%
plans for the business intelligence
system

01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:47:10.370 --> 01:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
do you have the answer
 
01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
the the prescription drug affordability
 
01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:13.729 align:start position:0%
the the prescription drug affordability
board

01:47:13.729 --> 01:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
um still hasn't collected any Revenue
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have an executive director
 
01:47:21.169 --> 01:47:21.179 align:start position:0%
um so I I mean at this point in time we
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
we're just in the process of finalizing
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
the mou
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
um so so that you know that that aspect
 
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
is considered there but we've received
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
no specific requests around data or what
 
01:47:33.290 --> 01:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
that data would even look like okay
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I thought
 
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to verify that
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
um and and then since you're working on
 
01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
the mou maybe you can anticipate this if
 
01:47:46.129 --> 01:47:46.139 align:start position:0%
if they want to do something with their
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
I.T that isn't consistent with the
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
Department's I.T infrastructure and
 
01:47:55.129 --> 01:47:55.139 align:start position:0%
strategic Direction can they still do it
 
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
because I know the commissioner has very
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
little authority that that with with
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
that board so I'm just curious if we're
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
potentially setting up to have redundant
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
I.T systems and data collection efforts
 
01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
sure and I I
 
01:48:15.649 --> 01:48:15.659 align:start position:0%
um does Mr weeders have the authority to
 
01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
say yes or no to an I.T request by the
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
well all of the all of the contracts
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
come through me so I have regular
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
interactions with agencies about if
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
things seem to be going off the rails
 
01:48:46.250 --> 01:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
from a standards perspective and I feel
 
01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:48.179 align:start position:0%
like you know we could guide that and it
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
and honestly it would make no sense to
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
do what you're suggesting because what I
 
01:48:55.129 --> 01:48:55.139 align:start position:0%
was going to comment that we have a
 
01:48:56.810 --> 01:48:56.820 align:start position:0%
pretty much a world-class ebi
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
environment now it would and it can
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
ingest any data we want to give it and
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
and manipulate the data appropriately as
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
needed so I think we have what's needed
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
already so so to build something out
 
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
from scratch wouldn't make any sense
 
01:49:14.209 --> 01:49:14.219 align:start position:0%
unless and I'll qualify this depending
 
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
on how it's administratively attached
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
and what qualifications exist under that
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
there may be a reason not to
 
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
so so for example if you're if you're
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
saying okay I've created this
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
administrative administratively attached
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
entity I'm not using DHHS specifically
 
01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
that has a oversight function for
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
example then you know we might prescribe
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
certain types of of data integration and
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
data sharing and then there might be a
 
01:49:43.729 --> 01:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
reason to do something else
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
I know I'm being non-specific but very
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
intentionally no I I I get it I'm just
 
01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh just checking how how big this is at
 
01:49:55.010 --> 01:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
this point and uh just as an FYI I I
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have an i this board won't
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
have an oversight function within
 
01:50:04.209 --> 01:50:04.219 align:start position:0%
government it will have a regulatory
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
view of the pharmaceutical industry so
 
01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative Walnut did you have a
 
01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:13.490 align:start position:0%
representative Walnut did you have a
comment

01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
no I have a couple questions I want to
 
01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
ask before we finish up I think we're
 
01:50:19.490 --> 01:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
getting close
 
01:50:21.169 --> 01:50:21.179 align:start position:0%
well we sort of skipped over I think we
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
skipped over page 25.
 
01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
which was your challenges and I the
 
01:50:27.970 --> 01:50:27.980 align:start position:0%
first one I see there is the low wages
 
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
and how it's impacting
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
um your work and I would like to know if
 
01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:35.450 align:start position:0%
um your work and I would like to know if
um

01:50:35.450 --> 01:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
I know we're going to have a 10 wage
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
increase and I guess I wonder in your
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
area where people are
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
highly trained and
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
technical skills is this going to help
 
01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:48.530 align:start position:0%
technical skills is this going to help
us

01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:50:51.169 --> 01:50:51.179 align:start position:0%
enough this is enough to attract people
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
to those jobs and then I have another
 
01:50:55.729 --> 01:50:55.739 align:start position:0%
question I'd like to follow up with
 
01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
so I would thank you for the question
 
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
um I would say that certainly a 10
 
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
increase will help but we're also
 
01:51:05.890 --> 01:51:05.900 align:start position:0%
working through that 12-month roadmap a
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
component of that is Recruitment and
 
01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
Retention goals and so we're going to be
 
01:51:14.689 --> 01:51:14.699 align:start position:0%
looking at how we can leverage funding
 
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
to advance our Recruitment and and
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
retention components including
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
recognition of Staff
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
highlighting functions like economic
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
like the tourism in our state like the
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
tourist functions and whatnot as well as
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what is it that
 
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
really brings people to a to a job but
 
01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
the component that we're really trying
 
01:51:42.410 --> 01:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
to address here in the Staffing is that
 
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
we put in a request as Nathan indicated
 
01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:47.090 align:start position:0%
we put in a request as Nathan indicated
earlier

01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
for additional Professional Services or
 
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
Consultants to off offset that impact
 
01:51:57.290 --> 01:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
and even if we were able to retain the
 
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
existing staff we are we are over
 
01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
described in projects and and solutions
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
that we need to address for either
 
01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
legislative mandate or just to manage
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
services for our citizens that we need
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
those Professional Services teams to
 
01:52:16.729 --> 01:52:16.739 align:start position:0%
come on board and in many cases the
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
reason why we think that's a good use of
 
01:52:20.810 --> 01:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
our funds in the state is that those can
 
01:52:22.689 --> 01:52:22.699 align:start position:0%
be you can bring them on for
 
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
purpose-built Solutions
 
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
and build those Solutions out and then
 
01:52:28.729 --> 01:52:28.739 align:start position:0%
you can let those Consultants those high
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
paid Consultants go and then really
 
01:52:33.649 --> 01:52:33.659 align:start position:0%
leverage your existing Baseline staff to
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
maintain and move that those Solutions
 
01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:36.890 align:start position:0%
maintain and move that those Solutions
forward

01:52:36.890 --> 01:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know if Dennis if you had
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
anything else yeah I would have a
 
01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
similar answer 10 10 absolutely helps
 
01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
particularly as you work your way up
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
this you know 10 of a bigger numbers a
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
bigger number so that it helps there
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
um you know it wouldn't create parity
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
between the private sector and the state
 
01:52:57.890 --> 01:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that's the intent and
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think we've ever had parity
 
01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
actually I think we may be in a more
 
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
severe situation than we've been in some
 
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
other times but I I don't think that
 
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
seeking parity is going to be our
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
solution so I I do other things
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
motivating things as well similar to
 
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
David with um you know trying to create
 
01:53:16.370 --> 01:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
situations that make you want to work in
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
the state make it a really good place to
 
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.450 align:start position:0%
the state make it a really good place to
be

01:53:19.450 --> 01:53:19.460 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
understanding that the compensation may
 
01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
not be uh you know directly competitive
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
with um you know your private sector
 
01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:29.149 align:start position:0%
with um you know your private sector
counterparts

01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
my other question was where would I find
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
I know you're going to try to contract
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
some of this work out
 
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
where do I find that in the budget the
 
01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:39.649 align:start position:0%
where do I find that in the budget the
contracts

01:53:39.649 --> 01:53:39.659 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
that you're hoping to so so if um I I
 
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
believe the LBA had sent you the
 
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended Budget Trailer
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
Bill appropriation I believe that's
 
01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
posted online right now and and within
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
that there's there's two hb2 Provisions
 
01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
that are funded out of the 23 Surplus
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
um for it automated Solutions analysis
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
it automated Solutions implementation
 
01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:03.179 align:start position:0%
ones for 1.5 million dollars to General
 
01:54:07.729 --> 01:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
funds and one is one for 1.95 million
 
01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:09.719 align:start position:0%
and I can certainly send the link that
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at okay
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
um and the other question I have about
 
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
that is did you have any other
 
01:54:18.370 --> 01:54:18.380 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs that did not get
 
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
included in your budget or in-house Bill
 
01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:25.250 align:start position:0%
included in your budget or in-house Bill
too

01:54:25.250 --> 01:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
a majority of our prioritized needs in
 
01:54:32.209 --> 01:54:32.219 align:start position:0%
the it realm were funded there are some
 
01:54:32.219 --> 01:54:33.430 align:start position:0%
the it realm were funded there are some
smaller

01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs that were not funded
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
that Dave and I had discussed trying to
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
find a way maybe by putting off some
 
01:54:43.129 --> 01:54:43.139 align:start position:0%
projects for a period of time I can
 
01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:45.179 align:start position:0%
certainly bring those forward
 
01:54:47.689 --> 01:54:47.699 align:start position:0%
um those that were not funded to this
 
01:54:51.169 --> 01:54:51.179 align:start position:0%
committee thank you
 
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
so a follow-up on that is on these
 
01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:58.139 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs are you able to show
 
01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
where your I.T prioritized needs map
 
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
into the Commissioners roadmap of 97
 
01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:07.250 align:start position:0%
into the Commissioners roadmap of 97
items

01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
because that to me that's a strong way
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
to justify a prioritized need is it's
 
01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
um certainly and the Professional
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
Services specifically but the other
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
items could map to those but they're
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to map to all of her roadmaps
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
because they all are reliant on those
 
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure services that we're
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
trying to provide so those Professional
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
Services groups they'll be assigned to
 
01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
different work streams to deliver the
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
the tasks that she has for those
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
roadmaps I wouldn't say maybe not all of
 
01:55:44.109 --> 01:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
them but I would say the majority of her
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
roadmap items will have some sort of tie
 
01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
to those Consulting dollars that we're
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.209 --> 01:55:59.219 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
um I I think we're going to be
 
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
continually in touch on this
 
01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
um so uh so thank you for coming in
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
today uh
 
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
the so the part of this is over I I just
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
want to say I I think I think we're
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
working pretty well in terms of once
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
once each of you get going and you start
 
01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
asking questions it's still in my intent
 
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
to not be interrupting you to let you go
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
ahead and have sort of your natural flow
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
and I know that that's unusual for most
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
chairmen but but I'm okay being unusual
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
so I just think it's a more effective
 
01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
conversation that way
 
01:56:39.169 --> 01:56:39.179 align:start position:0%
um and is there anything for the good of
 
01:56:41.330 --> 01:56:41.340 align:start position:0%
the cause here before we break up anyone
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
in the audience feel Miss Santa Nella
 
01:56:46.609 --> 01:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
you've been here all afternoon can we do
 
01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:52.990 --> 01:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else in the audience that
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
has anything to add or say or contribute
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee uh not
 
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
seeing Mr Ripple last call yeah could I
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
just add that if anybody wants to take a
 
01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
tour of the sununu center on
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
next Friday morning please let me know
 
01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
so I put out an email last night and I
 
01:57:14.209 --> 01:57:14.219 align:start position:0%
got three responses uh one of whom was
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
from a member one of which is from a
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
member of division one who may not have
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
realized that they have a full morning
 
01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
of bills that day so
 
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:23.219 align:start position:0%
um I I'm sort of reluctant to ask the
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
department to give two tours for two
 
01:57:24.599 --> 01:57:25.729 align:start position:0%
department to give two tours for two
people

01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:57:28.250 --> 01:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
um so if anybody else wants to attend
 
01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
please let me know so I was one of them
 
01:57:32.810 --> 01:57:32.820 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll go wherever the center of
 
01:57:36.109 --> 01:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
mass is so uh go ahead I was just gonna
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
say I was interested but when we were
 
01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
told that we would have that day as
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
though our one day off I've booked a
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
commitment with my kids so I apologize
 
01:57:46.609 --> 01:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
that I won't be able to attend
 
01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
maybe we could uh walk through there
 
01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
with a video to give you a feel we could
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
get one of those yeah so so
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative Paul you've you signed up
 
01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.330 --> 01:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh no I actually contacted and had one
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
oh yes so tell us what what are your
 
01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
impressions in 20 seconds or less what
 
01:58:14.149 --> 01:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
are your impressions so I told the
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
director Jerry that the condition of the
 
01:58:18.770 --> 01:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
rooms and the hallways was better than
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
not that I want to go right it was in
 
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
better shape than what I went to college
 
01:58:29.689 --> 01:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
for or the places I slept in college but
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
that says more probably about my college
 
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
than it does about the sununa center I I
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
had made that same observation and I
 
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
extended it to the my military facility
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
so it is better than that
 
01:58:45.850 --> 01:58:45.860 align:start position:0%
um so if if representative hole is gone
 
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who who's who's the
 
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
other there was one member from division
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
two I think it might have been
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not positive okay okay I'm
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna stay out of that but
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll jump on in whichever one you'd
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
end up with
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative will you have another
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
um the one observation that was made is
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
that space is really big for the number
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
of people that are there I mean right
 
01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
you could easily feel very isolated
 
01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:17.750 align:start position:0%
you could easily feel very isolated
given

01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:21.179 align:start position:0%
it's yes they can close off wings but
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
the hallways are whatever 10 feet wide
 
01:59:24.719 --> 01:59:27.830 align:start position:0%
the hallways are whatever 10 feet wide
so

01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.250 --> 01:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
okay so uh I think at this point we're
 
01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
ready to adjourn
 
01:59:34.850 --> 01:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
um all right division three is now
 
01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:39.169 align:start position:0%
um all right division three is now
adjourned

01:59:39.169 --> 01:59:39.179 align:start position:0%
