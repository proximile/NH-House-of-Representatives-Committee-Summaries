thank you I'm Norman Silber I'm a
 
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative from Belknap District 2
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%

Meredith and I live in Guilford
 
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.170 align:start position:0%
Meredith and I live in Guilford
oh

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
and I'm a member of the New Hampshire
 
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
bar as well uh
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
I was fascinated by the local or by the
 
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
elections when I moved here 10 so years
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
ago that we had this office of register
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
of probate and I tried to figure out in
 
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
looking through the the Constitution and
 
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
the statute books and everything else
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
what do they do and I realized that they
 
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
have one major Duty since the court
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
reorganization in 2011 when the duties
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
were basically transferred to the clerks
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
of the Probate Court the main duty is to
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
take the nice fancy certificate that you
 
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
get from the Secretary of State
 
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 align:start position:0%
attesting to the fact you were elected
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
and finding a framer to put that in a
 
00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 align:start position:0%
frame for you
 
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
um I I saw that I think
 
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
another representative at one time said
 
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
that they get a letter from the judicial
 
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
branch stating the court will not
 
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
provide a telephone office desk or key
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
to the courthouse
 
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
so there's basically it's an anachronism
 
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
and it's like as I've said to me it's
 
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
like a buggy whip Factory or something
 
00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 align:start position:0%
these days and we don't have buggy whips
 
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
anymore and so the register of probate
 
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
is really an anachronism this is a
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill I view this as a
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill uh there will be
 
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
another speaker a representative from I
 
00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 align:start position:0%
think from the judicial branch who found
 
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
a section of the rsas that OLS missed
 
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be added by a brief
 
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the repealer so it was
 
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
basically eliminating a position that
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
has no duties and uh you know should
 
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
just clean up the Constitution
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to answer any
 
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.270 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to answer any
questions

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none are you going oh
 
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative wolper so representative
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
silver that my understanding the primary
 
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
function of the registrar probate is to
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
ensure the uh
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh what they call that permanence of our
 
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.090 align:start position:0%
uh what they call that permanence of our
records

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering how that's going to
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
happen if there is no register of
 
00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:36.590 align:start position:0%
happen if there is no register of
probate

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
probate
 
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not aware that they actually
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
have any duties at all I believe that
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
the court clerk is responsible for the
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance of all the records of the
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
excuse me by the way the reason I'm not
 
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask is because I had covet
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
last year and got over it so I have a
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
high immunity level so
 
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.969 align:start position:0%
high immunity level so
okay

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other questions thank you
 
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much for
 
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 align:start position:0%
this person to testify would be judge
 
00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:18.650 align:start position:0%
this person to testify would be judge
king

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 align:start position:0%

good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
coming here this morning and
 
00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
taking the time to take up this what I
 
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
think is very very important bill cacr21
 
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
my name is David King
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
I am the administrative judge of the New
 
00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire circuit court before we had a
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
circuit court I was the administrative
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
judge of the probate court and before
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
that for 17 years I was a just a plain
 
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
old probate judge so for 32 years I've
 
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
been a judge in some fashion in the
 
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
system dealing with the probate court
 
00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
now probate Division and while I don't
 
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
profess to be an expert on very many
 
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
things I think
 
00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:01.259 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty familiar with the register of
 
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
probate office in the history and I
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Silber that
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
while this is a constitutional amendment
 
00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:10.139 align:start position:0%
it really is almost a housekeeping bill
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
at this point and hopefully I'll be able
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
to convince you of that uh this the
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Silber
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
referenced would be and we will provide
 
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
an amendment for the committee we just
 
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:24.740 align:start position:0%
came up this morning article 81
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
says that registers of probate cannot
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
act as counsel in any matter and that
 
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:30.979 align:start position:0%
should be changed as well if this
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment moves forward
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
but the register of probate office was
 
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
created in 1694 77 it was put into the
 
00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:44.149 align:start position:0%
created in 1694 77 it was put into the
Constitution

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.610 align:start position:0%
 
institution

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:45.620 align:start position:0%
institution
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's a handout that Richard had as a
 
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
handing out now that's been recycled
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
over the last 15 years many times it's
 
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
probably been submitted at least 15
 
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
times as exhibits in various forms but
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
it has a pretty interesting history of
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
the register of probate office in it
 
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
which I'm not going to go into
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
other than to say that a lot has changed
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
in the court system over the last 145
 
00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:08.030 align:start position:0%
in the court system over the last 145
years

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
the significant changes in the court
 
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
system began in 1983 in the legislature
 
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.060 align:start position:0%
when we became a unified court system
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
and I had the good fortune and privilege
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
to serve on this Committee in that that
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
legislative session 38 years ago when I
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
was 15 years old
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
and it was House Bill 200 representative
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
scitec who later became speaker of the
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
house was chair of the committee and we
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
essentially in House Bill 200 took a
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
county and municipal-based court system
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
and made it a state system
 
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
the registers of probate who were County
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
Employees elected officials remained in
 
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
the system as now state employees
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
and because it would involve a
 
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment House Bill 200
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
didn't deal with that I think the
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
thought at the time was we'll come back
 
00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
and deal with that later and today I'm
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:05.459 align:start position:0%
elected registers as I said stayed as
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
part of the court system
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a great system 10 different
 
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
ways of doing things
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
during the time that they were full-time
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
salaried employees in our the payroll
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
when in 2011 when they were essentially
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
eliminated was about a million dollars a
 
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:22.019 align:start position:0%
year for the Ten of them with benefits
 
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
but they were able to set their own
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
hours some of them showed up when they
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh you'll see in the materials
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
that there was a register from one
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
County who was elected in her 80s from a
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
um we had a register during my time as
 
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
administrative judge who did not believe
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
that people should be defaulted or that
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
we should send out citations so for a
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
two-year period that Court sent out no
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
defaults or citations which are required
 
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
by Statute
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
we had a newly elected register that
 
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
thought it would be good to strip down
 
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
the file so they weren't as thick so it
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
would shred parts of the files which
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
included unfortunately until we found
 
00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
out about it inventories from
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
guardianships which have the book and
 
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
page in it if you're trying to do a
 
00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:05.339 align:start position:0%
title search there's going to be a hole
 
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
with some of those records
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
and then one register who was elected in
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
a contested election and I met with her
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
as the administrative judge and was
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
curious why this person ran for office
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
and the response was well my nephew was
 
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
on probation once and I thought it would
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
be interesting to see what the Probate
 
00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
Court does having no idea at all what
 
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
the Probate Court did
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
and as I said they were pretty highly
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
compensated at that time so in 2011 we
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
created what is now called the circuit
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
court with House Bill 609 it came
 
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
through this committee it was fully
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
vetted we took 52 clerks and registers
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
in courts around the state and we
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
collapsed that management structure down
 
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
to 18. we had hoped to do it over 10
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
would be expiring just about now but the
 
00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
legislature loved the idea and it
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
required us to do it by the beginning of
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year so in three months we
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
collapsed the management structure from
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
52 clerks and registers down to 18.
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
and as I said we were and completely
 
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
transparent about the future of the
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
probate registers my testimony from the
 
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
Senate is included in the materials and
 
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
what I said is if they don't show up for
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
work we'll be okay
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
interesting to note that the registers
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
were all fairly politically active at
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
the time none of them showed up in the
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
house or Senate to testify on House Bill
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
609 and trust me they were never shy
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
about speaking up when they wanted to be
 
00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:36.170 align:start position:0%
about speaking up when they wanted to be
heard

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
and in that bill we paired their duties
 
00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.829 align:start position:0%
and in that bill we paired their duties
down

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
basically to nothing with the
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
expectation that after a few election
 
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
Cycles we would come back and ask for a
 
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment and we've now
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
been through five election Cycles after
 
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 609 we've had primaries where
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
no one signed up to run for register of
 
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
probate this year in Grafton County for
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
example in the general election the
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
register of probate one with 170 votes
 
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
um and if you compare that to the
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
register of deeds which is also a county
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
office that individual got 47
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
467 votes versus 170.
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
you'll be interested to know
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon and in Bristol you
 
00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
got 1207 votes and the successful
 
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
register probably got two votes so I
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
think it shows you how people view the
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
significance of the register of probate
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
office and in the same county two or
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
three terms ago a young man who was a
 
00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
fraternity brother at Dartmouth by the
 
00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:38.899 align:start position:0%
name of Mickel wapinski got elected
 
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
and they thought it would be a gag if
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
one of the fraternity Brothers could be
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
the register of probate and sure enough
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
was elected the good news is he beat out
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
keggy the kegger who got the second most
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
number of votes in Grafton County that
 
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
year and I met with Mr Lipinski after he
 
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
was elected obviously very intelligent
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
young man he's at Dartmouth and he kind
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
of apologized and said we had a party we
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
thought it would be a gag if one of us
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
got elected and I wanted to make sure he
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
was not in any trouble and I said as
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
long as you don't come back you won't be
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
in any trouble at all so he he was
 
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
leaving for New York and I never saw him
 
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.889 align:start position:0%
leaving for New York and I never saw him
again

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
we have only one probate register left
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
who was a register under the old system
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's Terry Peterson up in the first
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
circuit if I couldn't ask Terry to come
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
today she's got several people out with
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
illnesses but if she were here she would
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
sister of probate we get about eleven
 
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
thousand thousand probate cases a year
 
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
in the Circuit Court which is about
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
eight percent of our volume
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
we have gone to electronic filing for
 
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
almost all of our probate cases I've put
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
some statistics in your materials uh
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
which you're free to look at but it's
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
suffice it to say that ninety percent of
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
all probate cases are centralized here
 
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
in Concord the local courts don't even
 
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.339 align:start position:0%
know about Estates or name changes
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
because they're all done centrally
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
unless there's a need for a hearing
 
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
that's about three percent of the estate
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
cases and even in those situations where
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
hearing is needed we try to do the
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
hearings virtually centrally unless we
 
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
absolutely need an Evidence you're
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
hearing so the 10 probate divisions
 
00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
scattered around the state don't do any
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
probate work anymore essentially
 
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.509 align:start position:0%
probate work anymore essentially
um

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
we have an information center that
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
answers every single phone call that
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
comes into the Circuit Court they've
 
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
taken 4.4 million calls since we began
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
I've put the probate call volumes in
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
your materials you'll see in an average
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
non-pandemic here we get about 50 000
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
Probate Court calls ER probate division
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
calls a year
 
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
uh none of those have been fielded by a
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
register of probate over the last 10 and
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
a half years and when we went to
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
electronic filing we kept our pledge to
 
00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:46.019 align:start position:0%
the legislature to reduce our staff and
 
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
we actually reduced 10.7 probate
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
division employees around the state uh
 
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
between the shrinking management the
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
reduction in ftes for electronic filing
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
and other innovations that we've created
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
in the Circuit Court we've saved the
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of New Hampshire over 60
 
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars over the last 10 years
 
00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:09.779 align:start position:0%
so I'll end by saying that the circuit
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
Court's been on in operation for 10 and
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
a half years with absolutely no
 
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
contribution from the registers of
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
probate I think our track record proves
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
that they're obsolete it's not 1694
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
anymore it's 2022 and it's time to
 
00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
finish the job that representative
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
scitec started back in 1983.
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
I have yet to hear any good argument in
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
favor of keeping them except that's the
 
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
way it's always been so I would ask you
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
to please support this bill and I'm
 
00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:38.579 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
might have
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
questions for judge king
 
00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
yes representative Chase thank you very
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
much much Mr chair and thank you judge
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
king for taking my question
 
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer I have used probate I
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
was guardian of my daughter for seven
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
years until she passed away and I would
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
do that call in and then they'd ask me
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
what county I was from and then they
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
would send me over to the county probate
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
which actually was
 
00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:10.789 align:start position:0%
which actually was
Stratford

00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
Stratford
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
yes so the one in Kingston
 
00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
and the probate person there was the one
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
that did all the paperwork and all and
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
she would answer my questions Karen I
 
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459 align:start position:0%
think her name is so is this saying that
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
she wouldn't be available anymore they
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
would get dissolved that and everything
 
00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:26.579 align:start position:0%
would be done in Concord no Karen B
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
Shard is still at the probate court in
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
Brentwood um Brentwood thank you yes but
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
we also have a probate specialist
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
embedded in the information center now
 
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
who try we try to keep as many calls at
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
the information center because we're so
 
00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
short staffed in the courts but Karen
 
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
would still be available if you needed
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
some specialized question about the
 
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:51.299 align:start position:0%
guardianship case and I should say the
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
difference between the Estates and the
 
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:54.919 align:start position:0%
name changes which are essentially 100
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
centralized all of the guardianship
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
cases ultimately go out to the 10
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
probate divisions for a hearing because
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
they all require a hearing so that's
 
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a difference
 
00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:06.299 align:start position:0%
between those cases
 
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
follow up yes thank you very much so if
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
this was to be abolished does that mean
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
people are going to lose their jobs as
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
well how does that work well there are
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
10 elected probate registers right now
 
00:18:20.409 --> 00:18:20.419 align:start position:0%
they are paid a hundred dollars a year
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
and if this is passed I assume they
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
would collect their salary for the
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
balance of this term but they would they
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
would not be running for re-election the
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
next time so our payroll went from
 
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
essentially a million dollars a year
 
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
down to a thousand dollars a year for
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
the registers of probate awesome all
 
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
right thank you for clarifying
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo I'm pretty much
 
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
all set Mr chairman um my question was
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
about the salary I do want to say that I
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to visit
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
um the Circuit Court where the probate
 
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
department is um
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
located and it was very very very
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
impressive with the new kiosk and the
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
systems and the workers were very very
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
busy and very very happy so I
 
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.690 align:start position:0%
busy and very very happy so I
really

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
admire the work that's been done by
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
Justice King thank you for that
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo I appreciate that
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
you turn on your microphone
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
there now you can hear me so my uh
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
my question is what there's still
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
numerous uh references well not numerous
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
but a significant number of references
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
in the statute law to the register of
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
probate so what happens to those during
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
if we pass this Constitutional Amendment
 
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.650 align:start position:0%
if we pass this Constitutional Amendment
between

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
when the Constitutional Amendment takes
 
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
effect and uh when we would be able to
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
update the laws if we updated the laws
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
so what
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
yep excellent question representative so
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
when we created the Circuit Court it was
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's now chapter 490f and you'll see a
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
catch-all provision in 490f that says
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
any prior reference to the district
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
court the probate court of the family
 
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
division is now a reference to the
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court and any reference to
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
registers of probate is now a reference
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
to Clerks of the circuit court so we've
 
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
we we cleaned that up we could probably
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
go back if you know the probate statutes
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
at all it would be a real maze to try to
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
figure out everywhere that word is but
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
it could be done but I don't think it
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
would be necessary at this point
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
yeah let's go follow it please and if
 
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not don't they have some minor
 
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
duties like preserving their uh
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
authorized to preserve the uh historical
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
probate records in fact there's even
 
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
some funding for them to work with the
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
state archives So like um so are they
 
00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:51.419 align:start position:0%
totally so is my view correct or in your
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
opinion they're totally without any
 
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
function whatsoever at the moment no
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
they clearly have a function in the
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
statute which is to maintain the ancient
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
record the practical
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
situation is that they have for 10 years
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
not done it the clerks have done that
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
our clerks are trying uh to clean out
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
the courthouses because we're running
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
out of space and so we've worked with
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
Brian Burford at The Archives to get as
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
many probate records as we can there's
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
tension between that and the title
 
00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:18.299 align:start position:0%
abstractors who would like to keep the
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
records locally but as a practical
 
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
matter the registers of probate in the
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
10 Counties have not been involved in
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
that process okay all right thanks
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
yes representative Chase hi this is the
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
question it's a comment as uh
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo said this the new
 
00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:45.059 align:start position:0%
system that you have is great I enjoy I
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
don't enjoy it are you having to go on
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
there but um it's so much easier from
 
00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:51.539 align:start position:0%
even when I started my guardianship with
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
my daughter and had to go in and being
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
not understanding all the forms and now
 
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
everything is so simple to find easy to
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
do and also the follow-up if you do have
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you again I just
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment and thank you for
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%

about it and it's been great thank you
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%

you for your testimony today
and

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
committee I also appear here in support
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
of this proposed Constitutional
 
00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
of this proposed Constitutional
Amendment

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
um and I agree with with really
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
everything that has been said by the the
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
two prior Witnesses the one point that I
 
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
would make and I think it has some
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
significance I know this has been
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
referred to as kind of a housekeeping
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
matter and in many respects it it really
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
is but you know I think that there I I
 
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
think that there really is a need to do
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
this I mean that you know as some of you
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
may know uh uh just very recently
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
retired Secretary of State Bill Gardner
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
has some question about doing what was
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
done by Statute as opposed to by
 
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment
 
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
um I was in very much in favor of the
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
the statutory change because it needed
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
um you know you know under the old
 
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.590 align:start position:0%
um you know you know under the old
system

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess the analogy I would draw
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
is suppose that in this legislature our
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
legislative Services people were elected
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
on their own and had kind of their own
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
constituency and when we said you know
 
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
listen we want you to give priority to
 
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
putting this information together to us
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
they could say well you know we don't
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
think our constituency would would
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
support that we want to we want to
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
follow this this role I think we would
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
we would go nuts we would say wait a
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
minute how can we how can we run this
 
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
branch of government where there's
 
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
another you know somebody that's
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
supposed to provide essential services
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
to us sort of has their own agenda and
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
that was kind of what existed under the
 
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
old system with elected registers There
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
Was You know I can remember I was in in
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
the court system at the time I mean
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
there was one register of probate who
 
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
essentially wintered in Florida every
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
year collected a full salary and
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
wintered in Florida
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and you know
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
was very popular among the electorate
 
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
and so it was you know there not a lot
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
that could be done about that so it was
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
very very important I think that this be
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
done uh I was as I said I was a strong
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
supporter of making the statue change
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
but I mean I think I also think it's
 
00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:41.299 align:start position:0%
fair to say that
 
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
there is at least Bill Gardner I think
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
had has at least a an argument that the
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
proper way for this to be done should be
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
by Constitutional Amendment it's long
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
overdue the registers don't serve any
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
any useful purpose anymore the clerks
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
perform the work very very well uh much
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
more efficiently
 
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and so I think this would you know it
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
you can characterize it as kind of a
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
housekeeping but it's a little bit more
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
than that it really I think I think
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
substantly if substantively is something
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done and I hope uh that
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
you'll uh that you'll do that and I'm
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
any questions for uh representative Lynn
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
well representative Horrigan
 
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
um just representative Lynn I assume you
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
presumably had
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
as many of us had had lengthy
 
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
discussions with Bill Gardner about this
 
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
and the million other topics he was an
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
expert on but um was he
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
recall if he like was supportive of the
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment when you spoke
 
00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
to him or not because I actually
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
considered introducing something like
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
this a number of years ago and he was he
 
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
he actually I thought talked me out of
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
it of course sometimes it's hard to tell
 
00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:55.220 align:start position:0%
what Bill actually said it was very but
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so so see so have you did you
 
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
discuss it with him did he weigh in one
 
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
way or the other on uh on whether or not
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
there's constitutional member is a good
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
idea nothing not that we have to do what
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
he tells them to especially since he's
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
not here anymore
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
no no thank you very much for the
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
question representative the answer is no
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
you know I actually never directly
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
discussed this with with uh uh secretary
 
00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299 align:start position:0%
Gardner but I did know you know he had
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
from statements that he had made that he
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
was concerned about sort of doing this
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
by uh by Statute but that's the extent
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge of it okay you have
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
agreed thanks

I'm here this morning to speak to HB
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
1140 the bill I have introduced that if
 
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
enacted will provide New Hampshire
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
citizens with a simplified
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
or summary probate procedure for small
 
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.109 align:start position:0%

Estates
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
back in the fall of last year
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
I inquired of OLS as to the existence of
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
such a law in New Hampshire and was told
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
we do not have this type of law
 
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
prompted by my experience serving as the
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
executor for both my late fathers and
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
mother's Estates in two different states
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
and having two quite different
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
experiences in each state I was moved to
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
seek the better of the two
 
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
staff for the National Conference of
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
State legislatures have informed me that
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
almost all states have either or both of
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
two simplified estate procedures
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
so if this bill becomes law we would be
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
joining these states who have seen the
 
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.349 align:start position:0%
joining these states who have seen the
wisdom

00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
wisdom
 
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
in providing citizens with simple and
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
fairly low Estates a way to move quickly
 
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
through the probate process and get on
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
with their lives
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to acknowledge with thanks The
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
Entity fined law for the following
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
helpful and fairly concise information
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
about small Estates and the ways most of
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
our states have provided for their
 
00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.569 align:start position:0%

00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
generally probate for large Estates can
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
take years or even decades
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
however for smaller Estates there's a
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
simplified version of the process often
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
called simplified probate or summary
 
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.150 align:start position:0%
called simplified probate or summary
probate

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
probate
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
almost all states with the exception of
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
a few
 
00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:57.140 align:start position:0%
allow this simplified probate procedure
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
that saves money
 
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
and time
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
Most states allow summary probate as
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
long as the estate doesn't exceed a
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
certain limit
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
the amount of estate often refers to the
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
dollar value of the property that's in
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
the estate which varies by state
 
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the regular probate
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
process summary probate typically won't
 
00:36:26.569 --> 00:36:26.579 align:start position:0%
require a court hearing
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
instead beneficiaries can use Simple
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
methods to distribute the assets
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
the summary probate process starts when
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
the executor
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
or the surviving family member files a
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
petition for summary probate
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
the petition should indicate the amount
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
of the estate and a statement on how it
 
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
meets the limit to qualify for summary
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
probate under state law
 
00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:54.500 align:start position:0%
there is a will related to the estate
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
the petition should also show that the
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
will is valid
 
00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
next the executor will need to submit
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
supporting documents to go along with
 
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
the petition for summary probate
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
the court will require the executor to
 
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.339 align:start position:0%
attach a copy of the will in a list of
 
00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
errors and property assets
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
after the petition for summary probate
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
is submitted the summary probate process
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
goes into a waiting period
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
which gives creditors
 
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to file claim against the
 
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.490 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to file claim against the
petitioner

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
petitioner
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
this period for summary probate usually
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
lasts a month or two
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
which is much shorter than the regular
 
00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:38.210 align:start position:0%
which is much shorter than the regular
probate

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
probate
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
then the estate must pay an out all
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
outstanding taxes in debts and after
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
that the assets will be distributed to
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
the appropriate heirs once final asset
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
distributions distributions are made the
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
estate is closed

close quote
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
under the uniform probate code UPC there
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
are two different methods for simplified
 
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
probate affidavit and summary
 
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.690 align:start position:0%
probate affidavit and summary
Administration

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
because my positive experience as an
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
executor occurred in Rhode Island I have
 
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
utilized that State's law as a model and
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
its prescribed method of summary
 
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.310 align:start position:0%
its prescribed method of summary
Administration

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
I'm intrigued by the affidavit model but
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
consideration may wait for another year
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
understanding that some states offer it
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
only or as a choice in addition to
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
summary Administration
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's my thought that we see how summary
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
Administration excuse me yeah summary
 
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
Administration works here
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
as it does in 34 other states
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
as you as you might expect different
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
states have different threshold limits
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
Connecticut's is 40 000. Massachusetts
 
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
is 25 000. Rhode Islands is 15 000 and
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
Vermont is forty five thousand most
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
other states in other regions of the
 
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
country exceed these limits
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
including California whose limit is
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
166 thousand two hundred and fifty
 
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.150 align:start position:0%
166 thousand two hundred and fifty
dollars

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
New York fifty thousand and I actually
 
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
have a chart here if anyone is
 
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
interested at any point which shows the
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
limits in all of the 34 states
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
I selected twenty five thousand for HB
 
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
1140 as an initial conservative amount
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
to determine how our state would respond
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
of course if this committee were to
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
select a higher threshold I would not be
 
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
at all opposed
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
I believe this bill is a winner
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
for all parties concerned
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
simplified probate for small Estates has
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
worked very well throughout the United
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
States and I have every reason to
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
believe it or will work just as well
 
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and to the best of
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
my knowledge no state that has adopted
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
one of the two procedures summary
 
00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
Administration or affidavit has repealed
 
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
their laws
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
given the number of states that have
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
simplified probate for small Estates
 
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
clearly this is not a Republican or
 
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
Democrat partisan matter
 
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
I believe too that this bill is a
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan measure that ought to make
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
everyone happy
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
and that can only rarely be said of the
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
house and among all of our fellow
 
00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:22.609 align:start position:0%
house and among all of our fellow
citizens

00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
while I'm not an attorney I'd be pleased
 
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
to respond to any questions you may have
 
00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:28.619 align:start position:0%
and if I am unable to provide an answer
 
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
now perhaps one of the others here who
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
may be testifying
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
may be able to do so if not I'll do my
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
best to find the answer and get back to
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
you and if anyone is interested in a
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
copy of my written testimony and
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
supporting documents I'd be happy to
 
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
provide them to you upon request thank
 
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.770 align:start position:0%
provide them to you upon request thank
you

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
this is a request can you send that to
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
us electronically yes
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
the the testimony and the supporting
 
00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.349 align:start position:0%

documents

documents
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay be happy to do that now may I do
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
that through the clerk and have the
 
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579 align:start position:0%
clerk distribute to the members or do
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
you want me to mail to the email to all
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
the members individually all the
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
committee there's there's one email link
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
for the entire community that would be
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
perfect I'd be happy to do that thank
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
you you're very welcome
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Terry
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you um
 
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative Terry for your testimony
 
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
um you know I was going back into the
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
cupboards of my mind back when I was in
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
college and um that was in Massachusetts
 
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.290 align:start position:0%
college and um that was in Massachusetts
and

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
I learned about Mass probate which has
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
which has a process called a voluntary
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
Administration which would be similar to
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
this process now in Massachusetts the
 
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
limit is twenty five thousand dollars
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
the limit of the estate is 25 000.
 
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
does your bill include the value of an
 
00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:56.690 align:start position:0%
does your bill include the value of an
automobile

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that the the bill
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
itself specifies automobile
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
uh so the value of the automobile would
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
therefore fall within the calculation
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
for the 25
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
000 limit or whatever limit
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
the legislature would choose to SEC
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
by the way I had the same question at
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
the time that I was executing uh my
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
mother's estate in Rhode Island thank
 
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.230 align:start position:0%
mother's estate in Rhode Island thank
you

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
well thinking about the value of cars
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
today do you think it might make sense
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
to amend this bill to include or exclude
 
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
I don't see why not
 
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and I'll I'll
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
get this testimony and supporting
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
documents off to you within a couple of
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
days thank you thank you
 
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative Silber
 
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman once
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
again I'm representative Norman Silber
 
00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:26.339 align:start position:0%
from Belknap 2 towns of Guilford and
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
Meredith I live in Guilford I'm a member
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire bar since 2008 and
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
a member of the Florida bar since
 
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.829 align:start position:0%
a member of the Florida bar since
1970.

00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
1970.
 
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079 align:start position:0%
hard to believe
 
00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:42.740 align:start position:0%
in over 50 years of practice in Florida
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
I've done you know probably well in
 
00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
excess of 100 or more probate matters I
 
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
started out my career professional
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
career in a in a Trust Company on Wall
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
Street doing an overdosing I say
 
00:43:58.930 --> 00:43:58.940 align:start position:0%
overdosing on trust in Estates
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
the Florida summary procedure law not
 
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
terribly different than this has a
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
seventy five thousand dollar threshold
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I and it's all done all the unless
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's a will contest or something like
 
00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
that if there's no contest involved
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
everything probate is handled
 
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
electronically which works out
 
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
efficiently I have handled dozens of
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
Florida summary administrations for New
 
00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents for through their
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
their law firms up here uh because it's
 
00:44:34.329 --> 00:44:34.339 align:start position:0%
so easy to do and it's very simplified
 
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
analytically I think it's important to
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
think about
 
00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
what contact the average citizen has
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
with the legal system
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
you buy or sell a house
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
you may end up getting divorced
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
you should have a will and perhaps a
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
trust drawn
 
00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:55.010 align:start position:0%
trust drawn
um

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
hopefully you don't get involved in
 
00:44:58.609 --> 00:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
civil litigation so I think the average
 
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
citizen in our state has little contact
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
with the legal system
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
but when they get involved in in Probate
 
00:45:06.119 --> 00:45:07.809 align:start position:0%
but when they get involved in in Probate
matters

00:45:07.809 --> 00:45:07.819 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
you know it can sometimes get to be very
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
frustrating for the average citizen and
 
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
they're wondering about why you know why
 
00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
it's taking so long why they need to
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
hire a lawyer why it's so expensive and
 
00:45:21.849 --> 00:45:21.859 align:start position:0%
all these different things
 
00:45:25.329 --> 00:45:25.339 align:start position:0%
one aspect of Motor Vehicles because
 
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
that's always an issue there's a motor
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle in the name of the deceased
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
person you look up on Kelly Blue Book or
 
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
something like that and you find out the
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
value and all of a sudden you've eaten
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
up part of your threshold if not
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
completely as the representative pointed
 
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.349 align:start position:0%
completely as the representative pointed
out

00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:40.309 align:start position:0%
out
um

00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
an easy way to do that of course is to
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
title your car in the name of yourself
 
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
and your spouse so that when one of them
 
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
passes away it goes to the other outside
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
of probate but that's a different matter
 
00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:52.460 align:start position:0%
so but I'm I'm in support of this
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
basically of simplifying the system for
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
our average citizens that are having
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
small Estates uh
 
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
you somebody passes away and you cancel
 
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
a magazine subscription and you get a
 
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
refund check for 1.75 or you have a
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
small you have a bank account you find a
 
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
bank account of a thousand dollars or
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
something like that uh
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
right now we've got a backlog in our
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
court system because of covet
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
everything is backlogged everybody is
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
short-handed this is something that
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
would be very good for our citizens
 
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
because it would simplify everything
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
reduce expenses reduce the burden on the
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
courts and more importantly reduce the
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
burden to our citizens so I'll be happy
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
any questions for representation yes
 
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
I had a situation my youngest brother
 
00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:50.339 align:start position:0%
passed away and did not have a will or a
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
state or an executor of what he didn't
 
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
have anyway so I tried to close out his
 
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
bank accounts and I didn't know what was
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
in them I wasn't allowed to know I had I
 
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
went and showed the death certificate
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
they told me I needed to become executor
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
I knew there wasn't much there he was
 
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.589 align:start position:0%
I knew there wasn't much there he was
homeless

00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
so I did do all this but it was going to
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
cost me much more when I got the
 
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
information back from the court as
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
though um I just figured I didn't do it
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
because I think it was over a hundred
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
dollars that I had to pay to become
 
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
executive just to know what the heck was
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
in this account I chose not to and let
 
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
it run out and let them deal with the
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
bank fees
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
um but it is this kind of what we're
 
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
talking about that small little thing
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
and do does the deceased have to leave
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
an Executor noted somewhere I don't I
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
don't believe so and you know the the
 
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
line that we sort of use is if you don't
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
leave a will
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
the state has made a will for you
 
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
we have intestacy laws that basically
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
says that if you die without a will in
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
other words you are intestate
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
here's who gets who's who gets to Who's
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
Who here's who gets the assets and here
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
is who gets to be appointed executor
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
administrator or whatever so if you
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
don't make a will the state's made one
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
for you in the rsas already so yes but
 
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
but if you see the fee in representative
 
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
Terry's bill is I think 30 bucks I mean
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
it's really very very nominal and so it
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:26.780 align:start position:0%
the questions for representative Silber
 
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you um
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Silber for your testimony
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
I have a question about some of the
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
language on the bill
 
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.530 align:start position:0%
language on the bill
um

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
right under
 
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
or it's like section one I believe
 
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
section one if a resident of New
 
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:48.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dies living in a state
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
entirely a personal property the total
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
value of which exclusive of tangible
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
personal property
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
of which decedent was owner so
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
so is this saying that we're excluding
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
question it does not deal with real
 
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
estate if you if the deceased person
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
dies with real estate with or without a
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
will you've got to go through probate
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
this does not deal with real estate
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
I did just in terms of form it says here
 
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.690 align:start position:0%
I did just in terms of form it says here
that

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
the person that could
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
go forward with
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
litigating the estate is the surviving
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
spouse child grandchild parent brother
 
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
sister niece nephew aunt or uncle or any
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
interested party could it not just say
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
any interested party yes of course
 
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
but you know even though representative
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
Terry is not a lawyer I think he's
 
00:49:59.210 --> 00:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
picked up lawyer things you know we get
 
00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
paid by the word
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
so maybe that's why it says all that I
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testing
 
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you commit uh committee members
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
good morning again Mr chairman members
 
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is David King
 
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrative judge of the
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
circuit court and as I said have been
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
involved as a probate judge for 32 years
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
and have sat on thousands obviously of
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
cases over those 32 years and I'm here
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
just by way of information and raising
 
00:50:43.609 --> 00:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
some concerns that I have when judicial
 
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
branch is not taking a position on this
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
bill but the conversation that's taken
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
place so far is has raised some good
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
questions and I'll I'll try to address
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
those as I go through
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I do want to clarify that New
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did have a small estate
 
00:50:59.329 --> 00:50:59.339 align:start position:0%
Statute in the past it was twenty five
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars it was a statutory
 
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
scheme that was in place for a while and
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
it it didn't work and when it didn't
 
00:51:07.849 --> 00:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
work we came back to the legislature and
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
we tried to fix it with summary
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
Administration which we have waiver of
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
administration and some shortcuts that
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
we've built into the statutes that I
 
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:17.579 align:start position:0%
think do a lot of what the
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
representatives want to do so I want to
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
clarify that if the if we have an estate
 
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that's under twenty
 
00:51:26.089 --> 00:51:26.099 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars there was no bond
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
required it's a pretty simplified
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
application process and those are turned
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
around pretty quickly in this bill they
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
talk about the Probate Court which
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist anymore and so I'm
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that the intent is that these
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
get filed in paper locally
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
our e-filing system is not configured to
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
take something like this on so I think
 
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
it would actually slow the process down
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
that would be one of my concerns there's
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
no requirement for an inventory so
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
how is the Probate Court going to know
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
if there's twenty five thousand dollars
 
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
or if there's a hundred and twenty five
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars what what commonly
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
happened when we had small Estates in
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
the past and one of the reasons that we
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated the statutory procedure was
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
a petition would come in with good
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
intentions that everyone expected that
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
there was this one ten thousand dollar
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
bank account and we would appoint an
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
administrator and they would now have
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
the authority to investigate and Marshal
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
the assets and pretty soon it's twenty
 
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollars and they had to
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
start all over again and it was very
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
inefficient and that happened regularly
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
I don't see any real mechanism for
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
creditors to be paid representative
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
Terry said it would be there would be a
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
month or two to pay creditors claims
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
right now creditors have six months to
 
00:52:48.049 --> 00:52:48.059 align:start position:0%
make their claim and then a year to
 
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
perfect those claims I don't know if
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is meant to shortcut that or not
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
and I also don't see any notice
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
provision where creditors would even
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
know that the estate is open so I think
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
that the creditors might have potential
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
creditors might have concerns with this
 
00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:04.970 align:start position:0%
creditors might have concerns with this
process

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
currently if the estate's over ten
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars we require publication
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
which is a means of providing notice you
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
see the notices in the newspaper that
 
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
so-and-so has been appointed I've tried
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
to get that switched over to doing it
 
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
online but the newspapers want to keep
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
it in the newspaper so we haven't been
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
successful there
 
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:23.690 align:start position:0%
successful there
um

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
but it seems like there's no
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
accountability for the
 
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
administrator once they're appointed
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
they're off and running and they can do
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
what they want there's no scheme for
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
what also commonly happens which is
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
you've got a 25 000 estate but you've
 
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
got 35 000 worth of bills we have a
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme now that provides for
 
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
insolvent Estates it looks like from the
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
way I read this bill that the
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
administrator can kind of pick and
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
choose who gets paid
 
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure that that is the scheme
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
that you want to have in place because
 
00:53:58.609 --> 00:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
some creditors are likely to get nothing
 
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
and others may get paid 100 cents on the
 
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:01.730 align:start position:0%
and others may get paid 100 cents on the
dollar

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
the automobile is a good question that
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
has come up for years we do now have a
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
statute where if in the situation where
 
00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
someone dies and the only asset is an
 
00:54:11.099 --> 00:54:12.069 align:start position:0%
someone dies and the only asset is an
automobile

00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
automobile
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
you can go to the town clerks and I just
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
did this with my mom my dad passed away
 
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
in in February and for some reason my
 
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
dad's had a vehicle in his name alone
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
and we went to the town clerk's office
 
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
took about five minutes and the title
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
was switched over into my mother's name
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
no reason to go to the probate court so
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
we've I think dealt with the automobile
 
00:54:30.359 --> 00:54:31.910 align:start position:0%
we've I think dealt with the automobile
issue

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:45.950 align:start position:0%
issue
um

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:51.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.329 --> 00:54:53.339 align:start position:0%
I think those are the concerns that I
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
have there is there's apparently no
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
requirement for a final account so I'm
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
who if anyone gets noticed about where
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
the where the funds went
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
and there's no mention in the bill at
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
all about a situation where someone dies
 
00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
with a will it talks only about
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
intestacy and it talks about the
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
distribution under intestacy I'm not
 
00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:16.140 align:start position:0%
sure if this bill contemplates small
 
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
Estates where there's a will involved or
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
if those would go the normal route we do
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
have electronic filing for
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
self-represented filers which is about
 
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
half of our business it's a guided
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
interview much the same way
 
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative chase that the
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
guardianship is now and under 25 000
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
again no bond so I think and we do have
 
00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
a waiver of administration so if it's in
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
that you legislatures um just expanded
 
00:55:43.609 --> 00:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
that so for example
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
um everything to the wife that's a
 
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
waiver of administration there's no
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
account no inventory it's a much
 
00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
simplified process so I think the
 
00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:53.660 align:start position:0%
legislature's done a really good job of
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
streamlining the probate process already
 
00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
and so before we go back to the small
 
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
Estates I would just ask you to consider
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
those things and I'd be happy to answer
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have
 
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:08.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
judge king for taking my question so my
 
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
my question is with the creditors when
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
my daughter passed away and my brother
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
um I had the bills that were due and I
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
just called the creditors and told them
 
00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
that they had passed away some wanted to
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the death certificate but
 
00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
no one asked to pay the balance they
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
just dissolved it now is that the normal
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
way these things go I mean I took it
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
upon myself to call creditors is that
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
you were saying that had accreditors may
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
not be even notified of a death
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious how it works for future
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
so you I mean you as an a relative in
 
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
Heir perhaps an air at law have no
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
obligation to call the creditors if
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
you're appointed as administrator or as
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
an executor then you do have an
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
obligation to marshally assets and pay
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
the creditors to the extent that you can
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
I do want to follow up on a question you
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
asked earlier representative chase that
 
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
I forgot to raise which is the situation
 
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
where your brother passed away and I'm
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
very sorry for your loss um
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't clear whether
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
he had 10 cents in his bank account or
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars and how do you go
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
about doing that we also have a
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
streamlined process for that with no fee
 
00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:24.059 align:start position:0%
it's a one-page form we appoint you as
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
administrator to with the power to go
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
out and investigate what the assets are
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
so you take it to the bank and they you
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
know you can even get in the safe
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
deposit box the only thing you can take
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
possession of without a court order is
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
the will so if you go to the safe
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
deposit box and you find a will then you
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
can come back and open the estate but
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
you may find nothing
 
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
you can also open a Administration with
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
no filing fee with a very simplified
 
00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:51.059 align:start position:0%
process to get medical records so
 
00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes the family just want to find
 
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
out more about the death of a loved one
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
but there are no assets no filing fee we
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
give you the authority so the hospitals
 
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
will recognize it and you know maybe
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
there's an investigation of whether
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
there's been some malpractice or
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
something like that so that's commonly
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
used too
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
um so we don't make you pay and you
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
we have a form on our website that's
 
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.530 align:start position:0%
we have a form on our website that's
pretty

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
um easy to find that's a request to
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
waive the fee and I routinely waive fees
 
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
in Estates where there's not a lot of
 
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
assets certainly anything under a
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars if somebody asked me to
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
waive the fee I automatically do even
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
though that's Revenue out of the state's
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
pocket it seems like if it's a thousand
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
dollars we shouldn't be charging you 120
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
filing fee so
 
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.210 align:start position:0%
filing fee so
um

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:41.390 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
I just uh if I could just ask I think
 
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.510 align:start position:0%
I just uh if I could just ask I think
the

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh the situation where you have a twenty
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars or fifty thousand
 
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.410 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars or fifty thousand
dollars

00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:58:59.569 --> 00:58:59.579 align:start position:0%
uh and right now you're required to keep
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
the estate open for at least six months
 
00:59:06.049 --> 00:59:06.059 align:start position:0%
for creditors to make their claims
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
there is a fairly typical situation
 
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
where people have
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
find a bank account after someone dies
 
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:15.740 align:start position:0%
with two thousand dollars in it or
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
they've shut off the electricity and the
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
elect and the electric company sends a
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
check after the fact for a refund for a
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty dollars payable to the
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
person or the estate and you can't cash
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
it and people have to walk away because
 
00:59:31.319 --> 00:59:32.210 align:start position:0%
it and people have to walk away because
it's

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
more expensive and time consuming to
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
take the money than it is to process it
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
is there any can you think of any means
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
or method that could expedite the
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
processing of those types of cases the
 
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
only thing I can say Mr chairman we I
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
certainly don't like it when I see those
 
00:59:51.299 --> 00:59:52.250 align:start position:0%
certainly don't like it when I see those
cases

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
um is we waive the filing fee we make
 
00:59:58.609 --> 00:59:58.619 align:start position:0%
the appointment quickly and
 
00:59:58.619 --> 00:59:59.690 align:start position:0%
the appointment quickly and
um

00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
I mean I've even waived the requirement
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
of an inventory and account if that's
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
literally all there is and it's we know
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
where the money is going but the problem
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
again is when they think it's only that
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
one thing and then we make the
 
01:00:14.809 --> 01:00:14.819 align:start position:0%
appointment and they realize there are
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
other assets and then there's no real
 
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
way to find out what's going on so I
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
think it's a little bit of a slippery
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
slope once you go there but I I agree
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's terrible when somebody has to
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
open an estate for 500 it is and I've
 
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
had people come in come and somebody
 
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh hearings there are no
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
hearings with appointments anymore there
 
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
used to be some judges routinely had
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
petitioners come in for a hearing the
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
only hearings we have with regard to
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
Estates now and it's about three percent
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
of the cases where there's some kind of
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
a dispute between heirs or who's going
 
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
to get appointed or things like that so
 
01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:51.059 align:start position:0%
it's I think we've simplified it as much
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
as we can
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
leaving the Protections in place but I
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
clearly Mr Jim and there are very small
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
Estates that would be
 
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
nice to have some kind of a streamlined
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
capture those that Minority of cases and
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
not the ones where you think it's small
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden it's grown
 
01:01:13.609 --> 01:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
and then even even in that situation
 
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
maybe it's 500 but maybe
 
01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:16.970 align:start position:0%
maybe it's 500 but maybe
um

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
there's a creditor that's owed money and
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
and they need to have an opportunity
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
even you know the mom and pop was only
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
owed 100 bucks but they should be able
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
to get paid if there's money there so I
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative Kenny
 
01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.140 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I might just
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
not be understanding so I'm sorry if you
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
already explained this
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
um but it sounds like your concern is
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
like slippery slope and it might
 
01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
actually make it harder but we heard
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
from the prime sponsor that 34 other
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
states are making an applicable system
 
01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
work so could you just explain maybe
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
what those states are doing differently
 
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
than this bill would do or speak to that
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know because I don't have
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
the information about what states and
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
what they do we do not have the uniform
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
probate code so I'll start there that's
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
a decision that's been made over many uh
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
decades I guess we do have summary
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
Administration which is a word that was
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned a few times by the primary
 
01:02:18.849 --> 01:02:18.859 align:start position:0%
sponsors summary Administration is where
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
the fiduciary has been appointed the
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
bills are paid and they just file a
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
one-page form that says the bills are
 
01:02:25.559 --> 01:02:26.289 align:start position:0%
one-page form that says the bills are
paid

01:02:26.289 --> 01:02:26.299 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
and all of The Heirs at law or legatees
 
01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
under the will assent they sign that
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
they give it to us and we close the
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
estate no need for any kind of an
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
accounting we get a lot of those waiver
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
of administration is even a more
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
simplified process and as I said this
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislature expanded that but
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
you know the funds are all going to a
 
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
child or children or a spouse they file
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
a petition they're appointed and then
 
01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
after six months they file an affidavit
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
that says the bills are paid we close
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
the estate no inventory no account very
 
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
simple process and we got a lot of those
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
too so those were both legislative
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
initiatives that came about after we got
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
rid of the small Estates the 25 000 and
 
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
I think they're shortcuts that have
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
thank you committee for letting me speak
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
my name is Robert Wells I live in
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton New Hampshire I'm the senior
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
trust and State Attorney at the McLean
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
Middleton Law Firm I'm also a member of
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
a committee of approximately 40 trust
 
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
and estate practitioners which meet
 
01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:52.339 align:start position:0%
regularly to review proposed legislation
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
and then work with the probate judges to
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
make sure that whatever is going to be
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
proposed is acceptable to them as well
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
as making it easier for us as
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners including trying to reduce
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
unnecessary cost
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
we have been very successful as judge
 
01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:13.819 align:start position:0%
king has indicated with changes in the
 
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
legislature most recently in August of
 
01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
this year where we expanded waiver of
 
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
administration including providing a
 
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
probate judge with the discretion to
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
waive Administration in a situation
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
where it is not necessary
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
having practice for over 50 years and
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
both just here in really in New
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have seen needless to say
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
small Estates and larger States
 
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
I think we can be proud of what we have
 
01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
done here we have protected creditors
 
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
many times the first thing a beneficiary
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
wants to know is when can they get their
 
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.109 align:start position:0%
wants to know is when can they get their
money

01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
and they don't understand the primary
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility of a fiduciary in the
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
first instance is to pay creditors
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
before you pay beneficiaries
 
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
judge king referenced notice to
 
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
creditors which is a critical Factor as
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the administration of any
 
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.470 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the administration of any
estate

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
estate
 
01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
we have a duty under common law and
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
under case law to notify creditors and
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
if we fail to notify creditors then the
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations the six months
 
01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
that judge king referred to no longer
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
applies and they can come in at a later
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
date for purposes of reopening an estate
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
and going against the fiduciary for
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
having failed to give them notice
 
01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
uh the small estate legislation in front
 
01:05:39.609 --> 01:05:39.619 align:start position:0%
of you to me does not work
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about the issue of
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
what we now have is a very simple
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
process with the electronic filing of
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
petitions for probate we send in
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
original wills and original death
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
certificates hard copy notices go out
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
from the probate court to all the
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries notice shows up in the
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
paper thanks to the Probate Court
 
01:06:05.569 --> 01:06:05.579 align:start position:0%
providing that notice so creditors are
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
familiar with who the fiduciary is
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
including names and addresses so they
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
can contact them for purposes of any
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
claim which they want to make
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill is not a helpful
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill I think and in fact it's going to
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
be a regressive bill I I'm concerned
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
about what happens in a situation even
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
in the case of intestacy a lack of
 
01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
notice we know sibling rivalry creates
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
many issues and sometimes siblings live
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
here and live elsewhere I see the small
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
estate being one where there could be
 
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
somewhat taking advantage of another
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
sibling or another member of the family
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
simply by not giving them notice so I'm
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill and I would hope
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
that you would not pass it but I'm here
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
seeing that I just I just want to follow
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
up on the question I asked judge king
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
and that's with regard to those very
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
small incidents where you find that two
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar account or
 
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
or somebody gets paid a check after
 
01:07:18.529 --> 01:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
their demise and
 
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
and then it
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
it's not something that typically an
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
attorney would be involved in because
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
you can't afford to hire an attorney to
 
01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:29.339 align:start position:0%
process it
 
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
so is it um
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
is that something that your committee
 
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
has looked at as a way of coming up with
 
01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
some remedy to address those types of
 
01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:40.730 align:start position:0%
some remedy to address those types of
issues

01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
our committee really hasn't dealt with
 
01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
that time of that
 
01:07:44.819 --> 01:07:45.890 align:start position:0%
that time of that
specific

01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
type of refund many times what will
 
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
happen in a common situation where if
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
it's a husband and wife or the husband
 
01:07:56.089 --> 01:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
has died and there's an only child and
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
there is a joint bank account many times
 
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
what we suggest is that before they
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
close out the joint bank account they
 
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
simply put that money in an envelope
 
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
with a deposit slip and send it in
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
because the bank doesn't know
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily that the person has passed
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
away and they're they have the funds in
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
that account which avoids the problem we
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
have that often with our nursing homes
 
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
which have refunds refunds commonly will
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
be paid to the estate of versus to an
 
01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.410 align:start position:0%
be paid to the estate of versus to an
individual

01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:29.420 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
we sometimes in the more sophisticated
 
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
homes which have large amounts of money
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
coming back we ask that a trust be paid
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
versus the estate or the person who has
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
gone into that particular home can
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
specify he want his children to receive
 
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
the refund so there are ways of handling
 
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
that but not specifically to address the
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
500 one that you mentioned other than
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
judge king indicating that he uniformly
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
provides waivers in that situation
 
01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing them thank
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony today thank you
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record my name is
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
janellejian I'm an attorney representing
 
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire Department of
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
the department does not take a position
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
on this bill but similar to what you've
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
heard we have concerns
 
01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:40.259 align:start position:0%
my job at the department is general
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
counsel foreign manager of the Medicaid
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
estate Recovery Unit
 
01:09:47.329 --> 01:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
on average over the last 16 years we
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
recover about 6.7 million dollars on
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
behalf of the taxpayers
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
this bill does have a number of problems
 
01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
the department would remain a resource
 
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
should it would require amendments
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
should the committee decide that this
 
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
bill should go forward in order to work
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
from the Department's perspective
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
the concerns that I have are numerous it
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
proposes as you've heard a new process
 
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
that would take time for the court to
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
adopt to and for anybody practicing
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
probate law to adopt to but more
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
importantly this bill proposes a few
 
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
different things that are contrary to
 
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
other probate statutes
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't provide the priority of who
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
can probate it just lists the number of
 
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
people it also more importantly from the
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
Department's perspective as a creditor
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
does not provide for the priority of
 
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
expenses in an estate that's similar to
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
the one that's already articulated in
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
in that case the department does have a
 
01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
priority over other creditors and has
 
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
had one for over 10 years now in this
 
01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:56.390 align:start position:0%
had one for over 10 years now in this
state

01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
should we go back to this old payment
 
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
of this old payment priority system it
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
would be a significant negative fiscal
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
impact on the state of New Hampshire
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
to the state general fund over a million
 
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
and that's just in what we recover for
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
the state general fund it would also
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
recover it would also
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
result in a negative fiscal impact to
 
01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
the counties and we recover on behalf of
 
01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.699 --> 01:11:31.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
I wanted to add a little bit more about
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
the six-month creditor period that is
 
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
very important for due process there is
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
actually U.S Supreme Court case that
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
says the minimum is six months
 
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
so we can't shorten that creditor
 
01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
process without running a foul of
 
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
creditors due process rights
 
01:11:54.649 --> 01:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
I do deal a lot with my counterparts in
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
all 50 states or with all in all 49
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
states with respect to a state recovery
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
and I am familiar with probate estate
 
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
work in the other states and I would
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
have to say that having been an attorney
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the state for coming up on 23 years
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
I think New Hampshire is very
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
Progressive in this area and I think
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
that we have a number as you've already
 
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
heard a number of ways for people to do
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
shortened pro-b for medical records as
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
you heard to figure out what's going on
 
01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
with assets as you've heard for no fee
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
but we also have one and done forms for
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
other small probate processes as well
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
that are very unique
 
01:12:35.699 --> 01:12:37.189 align:start position:0%
that are very unique
um

01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
and that is not something that exists in
 
01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
other states do have these short
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
probates but routinely my counterparts
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid estate recovery run into
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
credit creditor notification problems in
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
those States
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
and what this unit what my unit does is
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
something that New Hampshire has done
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
since before Medicaid was enacted in the
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
early 60s
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
welfare recovery has been part of the
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
fabric of this state since the 1930s
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
and to introduce this bill now would be
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned a very significant
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
setback for the department and for the
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of this state
 
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
those protections are very important for
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
all creditors but for the Department
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
included and they're also important for
 
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
the other heirs because as you've also
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
heard from attorney Wells and judge king
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
you don't you cannot imagine the family
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
in fighting until you see it and live it
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
every single day one person gets gets
 
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
access to the money and poof they're
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
gone and I see that a lot I also see the
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
case where there's that one check that
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
comes in after the estate closes and
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
attorney Wells mentioned and I agree
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
that that check oftentimes just gets
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
deposited in the bank account and the
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
bank doesn't have a problem with it it's
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
not as big a problem as you would think
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
we can sit here anecdotally come up with
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
these things and maybe it's happened to
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
us and maybe it hasn't but on whole I do
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
this every single day all day long day
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
in and day out and I have for years I
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't see this as a I don't see it as a
 
01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
very frequent event
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
so I rather than repeat everything else
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
you've already heard I think
 
01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
procedurally this bill has some issues I
 
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
think there's a negative fiscal impact
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
the department would be more than happy
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
to be a resource should it go forward
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
because I do think it would require some
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
significant Amendment
 
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you thank you is there
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else who would like to be heard
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
with regard to house bill 1140.
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no one
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
clear the hearing closed
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll move on directly to our next
 
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
hearing which is House Bill 1389
 
01:14:59.689 --> 01:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
establishing the Superior Court land use
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
review docket
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
I'll call upon the prime sponsor
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn to provide his
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Bob Lin I'm a rep
 
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
from Windham and just as a first point
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
on on the bill I I do have a proposed a
 
01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
very slight change but I think an
 
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:32.060 align:start position:0%
important one and I have to thank
 
01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
representative chip Kimball for bringing
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
this matter to my attention on the um on
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
the first page not the not the title
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
page but the first actual page of the
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
law in section uh proposed section 491
 
01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
7B Roman numeral one on line nine
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the that's uh just picking up sort of
 
01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
mids Midstream from the prior line it
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
says um
 
01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
from decisions of local land use boards
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
decisions of Municipal planning boards
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
zoning boards historic district
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
commissions and conservation commissions
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
a Conservation Commission shouldn't be
 
01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
there that representative rep as
 
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
representative Kimball pointed out to me
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions do not have the
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
kind of authority of those other of
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
those other zoning boards planning
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
boards historic districts commissions
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions are established
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
36a and their their responsibilities are
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
much different so in what I would
 
01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:43.739 align:start position:0%
propose is to instead of saying
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions include to
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
change the language to read and local
 
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
governing bodies that is that is
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
language that is included in the
 
01:16:57.169 --> 01:16:57.179 align:start position:0%
planning and zoning laws and it would it
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
would include for example uh decisions
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
of you know the local Board of Selectmen
 
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
or Board of Mayor and Alderman that is
 
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
that that is proper and I it was a
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
really good catch on the part of
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
Representative Kimball had a nice
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
discussion with him and I'm very glad
 
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
um that he that he caught that
 
01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
um that he that he caught that
um

01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
the purpose uh uh Mr chairman of members
 
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
of the committee of establishing this uh
 
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
land use docket basically is is designed
 
01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:28.100 align:start position:0%
to bring more efficiency to the land use
 
01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:31.940 align:start position:0%
uh uh appeal and review process
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
this proposed bill is is taken in many
 
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
respects from uh the business Docket in
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
which it currently exists in the
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
superior court and has existed for more
 
01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
than 10 years now uh really
 
01:17:45.659 --> 01:17:46.250 align:start position:0%
than 10 years now uh really
um

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
very successfully I know that yesterday
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
this committee heard Bill's dealing with
 
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
the land use appeal board and um you you
 
01:17:59.330 --> 01:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
may have questions frankly about the
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
issue of you know well we have a land
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
use appeals board and now we would have
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
this land use docket a couple of things
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
I I would point out first is that this
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
if this bill is approved
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
this bill has a a wider jurisdiction in
 
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
other words the the land use board Deals
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
Only with housing appeals and I think
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
there is also a provision in there that
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
says if there's a if there's a
 
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
development that includes both housing
 
01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:29.570 align:start position:0%
development that includes both housing
and

01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
you know as part of the housing some
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
kind of commercial development in other
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
words maybe it's you know the first
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
floor of a building is going to be
 
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
commercial and then there will be
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
apartments or Condominiums upstairs that
 
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
could be covered by the
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
um the land use board but something
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's purely a commercial development
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
would not would not be covered whereas
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
it would be covered uh by this and the
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
idea of of this is to establish a
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
specific docket where cases would go to
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
judges who have who would be appointed
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
with the expectation that they would do
 
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
you know mostly this kind of work have
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
an interest in doing this kind of work
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
and and uh because of their expert the
 
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
expertise that they have in the area and
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
would gain in the area
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
um they would be able to to handle the
 
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
work uh more efficiently
 
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
um it does set some time limits I think
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
that are reasonable I know that um Mr
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
head from the judicial branch is here
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
and obviously he may have some some more
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
detailed information on that I it's
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
clear to me that the judicial branch
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
will need some resources if we were if
 
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
we are uh if this bill goes forward and
 
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's uh entirely
 
01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:46.370 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's uh entirely
reasonable

01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and I'll let I'll let him address
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
that more specifically but I think that
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
um you know in the just as to use it go
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
back to the business Court dock it as an
 
01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.649 align:start position:0%
back to the business Court dock it as an
example

01:19:57.649 --> 01:19:57.659 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
um that uh has operated very
 
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
successfully we had uh judge McNamara
 
01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
who many of you may know served as the
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
business court docket judge for really
 
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
for the entire he was the first one and
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
served for the entire time of his tenure
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
over 10 years as a business court docket
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
judge just an excellent jurist I think
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
very well respected uh you know
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the bar and the legal
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
Community just did an excellent job and
 
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that we would have the same
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
kind of thing uh kind of thing here with
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
whoever is appointed uh to the land you
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
stock it so I uh I think it's it's
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
something that's important and that
 
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
should be done and I and I guess the
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
other the other points that he sent that
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
some of you are may have questions about
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
you know well we have the land use board
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
and now we would have this special
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
docket why do we have sort of two
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
Avenues of appeal
 
01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
there are none questions would be some
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
overlap but a bear in mind that that is
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
not at all unheard of we have had for
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
I bet you it's got to be 50 years and
 
01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:10.820 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh uh
 
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
land land tax and land condemnation
 
01:21:18.169 --> 01:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
matters we've had both the uh you if you
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
know if you're aggrieved by a taxing
 
01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
decision or a condom condom condemnation
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
something like that you may appeal that
 
01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
either to the board of tax and land
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
appeals or you may appeal it to the
 
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
superior court that system has existed
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
for a long time seems to work fine and I
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
I don't see any reason why this system
 
01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:44.219 align:start position:0%
would not would not work fine so with
 
01:21:44.219 --> 01:21:44.930 align:start position:0%
would not would not work fine so with
that

01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
um I think that sort of summarizes my
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm happy to answer any
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
questions questions for representative
 
01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.490 align:start position:0%
questions questions for representative
Lynn

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
Lynn
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative wolfer uh thank you Mr
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you thank you for taking
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
my question so you're not suggesting
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
that we the docket would replace the
 
01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board I am not I am not
 
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
suggesting that no
 
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman thank
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
you very much representative
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
um are you um I guess you're envisioning
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
are you envisioning
 
01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
appointing a current Superior Court
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
judge and re-uh reassigning him or her
 
01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
to this docket or we're going to hire or
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
have the exact Council hire a new person
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
and if it's and for hiring a new person
 
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.610 align:start position:0%
and if it's and for hiring a new person
um

01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
how does that I believe
 
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
I believe in a budget trailer Bill we
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
set a a limit on the maximum number of
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judges we can have so
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
that count towards that maximum number
 
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
where would that be like in addition to
 
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
however many we're limited to now
 
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
and I well I think I I think this bill
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
envisions that there would be a new
 
01:22:56.050 --> 01:22:56.060 align:start position:0%
appointment for someone to that docket
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
and whether
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
you know whether let's assume this bill
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
passed really quickly and there was
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
there was a an opening uh on the
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
superior court I suppose the governor
 
01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
could nominate and the executive council
 
01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:11.219 align:start position:0%
could confirm someone making it an
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
appointment to this docket I mean to the
 
01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
the land you stock it my anticipation is
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
and I again I think Mr head may have
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
more to say about this that the
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
anticipation would be that there would
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
be another judge you know a new judge uh
 
01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
authorized for this
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
um as was pointed out in in other
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
contexts I think particularly given the
 
01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
really I think very you know detrimental
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
impact of the covid situation on the on
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
the particularly the trial courts the
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
superior court and the uh and the
 
01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court I think you know to have
 
01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
if we're going to add this uh this sort
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
of specialized docket I think that they
 
01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
really do need more resources to uh to
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
be able to deal with it and so I I again
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
I'll let judge I let uh Mr head speak to
 
01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
that but I think that that probably is
 
01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:05.219 align:start position:0%
what is in anticipated and I think that
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know I would support that
 
01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.810 align:start position:0%
you know I would support that
thanks

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Langley
 
01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker good morning
 
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:16.729 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
question

01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
if there was a situation where there was
 
01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
conflict between the land review board a
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
decision made by that board and this
 
01:24:25.729 --> 01:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
venue who would have the ultimate
 
01:24:25.739 --> 01:24:27.530 align:start position:0%
venue who would have the ultimate
Authority

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
I think both I mean ultimately I think
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
the the ultimate review would be at the
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to go to another both both
 
01:24:38.649 --> 01:24:38.659 align:start position:0%
of both the land use board
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
and the and this docket you know appeals
 
01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:44.420 align:start position:0%
would be to the Supreme Court and again
 
01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:47.219 align:start position:0%
the analogy would be to the board of tax
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
and land appeals and the superior court
 
01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
that system has existed for you know for
 
01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
a long time and those appeals both go to
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court thank you
 
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
any other questions yeah representative
 
01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:01.790 align:start position:0%
any other questions yeah representative
Chase

01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
Chase
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm reading the
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
mythology in the back and it says the
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
new Associated Superior Court Justice
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
would be appointed so what's the
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
difference between an associate Superior
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
Court judge and a superior court judge
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
and aren't we short of Judges at this
 
01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.770 align:start position:0%
and aren't we short of Judges at this
point

01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
I I think I mean I think all all of the
 
01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
except for the Chief Justice of the
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
superior court I think the official
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
title really of all the Superior Court
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
judges is associate Justice and I think
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
if you the language in um
 
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:39.380 align:start position:0%
as was the case with the business Court
 
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
although the judge you know a judge
 
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
would be appointed if this bill passed
 
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
to the land use docket
 
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
the judge would still be a regular
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judge in the sense that
 
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
um you know if if there were if there
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
were other cases that that you know
 
01:25:59.209 --> 01:25:59.219 align:start position:0%
criminal cases or other civil cases that
 
01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
you know had to have had to be heard
 
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
that judge would have the authority to
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
hear it just as judge McNamara you know
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
he didn't he did
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
he did the business court cases but he
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
also from time to time heard criminal
 
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
cases and other things and that's I
 
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
think the same as intended here thank
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
you that helps
 
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson did you have a
 
01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:21.050 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson did you have a
question

01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:26:27.610 --> 01:26:27.620 align:start position:0%
um I just need a little bit of clarity
 
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
is the when you're referring to the land
 
01:26:33.169 --> 01:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
use board the land review board the
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board are those all the
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
same thing are those three different
 
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
boards no they're they're different
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
things if I'm and I'm sorry if I've
 
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
confused you I apologize I don't have
 
01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:44.750 align:start position:0%
confused you I apologize I don't have
deep

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
deep
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
no no so so for for a long time and I I
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not sure when it was first
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
established but there's there has been a
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
board what's called a board of tax and
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
land appeals it doesn't hear you know
 
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
the appeals from like zoning or planning
 
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
decision but if you if for example you
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
know the local you get an assessment on
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
your property and you think it's too
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
high and you want to challenge it
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
under the law as it has existed for many
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
many years you have a choice you can
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
bring that appeal to What's called the
 
01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
board of tax and land appeals
 
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
or you can bring it to the Superior
 
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
Court you have the choice to do that and
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
then in either case you know if you're
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
not happy with the decision you get from
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
the superior court or the board of tax
 
01:27:34.129 --> 01:27:34.139 align:start position:0%
on land appeals you can appeal to the
 
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court this if this bill were
 
01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:38.510 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court this if this bill were
enacted

01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
um it would have it would operate with
 
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
the with the land use appeals board in
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
the same way if you assuming that for
 
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
example you had a you uh there were you
 
01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:52.070 align:start position:0%
example you had a you uh there were you
were

01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
um you were aggrieved by let's say a
 
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
local planning board decision and let's
 
01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
assume it involved housing so that it
 
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
would be covered by it would be within
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of both entities you
 
01:28:06.169 --> 01:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
would have the choice you could appeal
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
to the uh land use board uh
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
or you could decide to go to the
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court it would be it would be
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
that you know your choice as the as the
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
appellant and then in either case if you
 
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
were not happy with what the board did
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
or what the Superior Court did you could
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:31.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:28:42.649 --> 01:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
an attorney had you asked for five
 
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:45.780 align:start position:0%
minutes and we're running a little
 
01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
behind so I'm going to hold you through
 
01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:57.229 align:start position:0%
behind so I'm going to hold you through
that

01:28:57.229 --> 01:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:29:00.649 --> 01:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch we do not have a
 
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
policy position on this bill what's
 
01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
being handed out is a proposed amendment
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
and it may also be since there's a
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it would be an amendment
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
dealt with with a finance committee but
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
IT addresses one of the questions that
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
came up earlier which is would a new
 
01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
Justice need to be appointed and would
 
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
that change the total number of Judges
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
that are allowed by Statute currently
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's a chief justice and 21 associate
 
01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
Justice or judges which is where that
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
naming comes from we would ask that that
 
01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
number be increased from 21 to 22 and
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
that there also be an appropriation
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
because we're no longer we're not in a
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
budget year so there would have to be an
 
01:29:50.450 --> 01:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the new judge or if if
 
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:52.139 align:start position:0%
it was the desire of the legislative
 
01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
body then there would be a pause in
 
01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
terms of starting up this docket we can
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
wait till the budget year comes into
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
effect and do the budgeting at that
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
point but one of the one of the sort of
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
key themes that we've seen in a number
 
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
of bills is the desire to have these
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
dockets go faster there are a lot of
 
01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
timing issues associated with the
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
developments but these also tend to be
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
very complex dockets so they tend to
 
01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
take a little bit of time for the judges
 
01:30:24.610 --> 01:30:24.620 align:start position:0%
the parties and those that are
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
interested in these cases to get
 
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
involved and get all the evidence sort
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
of marshaled and before the judge they
 
01:30:33.169 --> 01:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
tend to involve Experts of their complex
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
cases so they you know they can take
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
some significant amount of time if there
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
is a dedicated docket and there is a
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
dedicated judge that would be able to
 
01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
that would be an additional judge it
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
would allow that judge to spend more
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
time on these cases to be able to focus
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
on these cases and to be able to get
 
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
them and resolve them in a more timely
 
01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.910 align:start position:0%
them and resolve them in a more timely
manner

01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
manner
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the the split between
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
the existing sort of uh land appeals
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
board and this as Justice Lynn mentioned
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
you know that does happen both boards
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
are governed by the same rules that are
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
the same laws so they're they're
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
reviewing these projects based upon the
 
01:31:15.649 --> 01:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
same underlying laws they're just doing
 
01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
it through either less formal process
 
01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
through the board or more formal process
 
01:31:23.689 --> 01:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
with the superior court but if you if
 
01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
you have a spiritual judge with a with a
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
docket of roughly you know 800 cases you
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
know land use docket case or a land use
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
case sort of gets mixed in with the
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
other cases if you do have a dedicated
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
docket you have a dedicated judge that
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
would help expedite some of the some of
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
those cases I mean with that I'd be
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.810 --> 01:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
yes representative trottier thank you Mr
 
01:31:53.639 --> 01:31:54.470 align:start position:0%
yes representative trottier thank you Mr
Speaker

01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir quick question on the
 
01:32:01.209 --> 01:32:01.219 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I see that they're showing a
 
01:32:04.129 --> 01:32:04.139 align:start position:0%
279 thousand dollar
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
um expense in 2023
 
01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
and in 2024 that almost doubles and in
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
2025 it still increases whereas in the
 
01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
note it says you know under that 279
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
one-time expense which includes phones
 
01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
I.T computers and things like that can
 
01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
you explain why the big increase sure
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the the
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
expectation was it was going to come
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
into effect halfway through a fiscal
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
year so it didn't account for a full
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes representative Lorenzo
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and hello again um
 
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
Mr head you know I'm having a hard time
 
01:32:59.810 --> 01:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
sort of envisioning this post schematic
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
so would it be possible if
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor or yourself could send us
 
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
sort of like a diagram of you know how
 
01:33:11.090 --> 01:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
this is going to work
 
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to although I'm not sure it
 
01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
would be a very simple diagram you have
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
so for example a planning board makes a
 
01:33:19.139 --> 01:33:20.270 align:start position:0%
so for example a planning board makes a
decision

01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
there are a number of potential parties
 
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
who could be appealing that if there was
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
a butter that was unhappy with the
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
decision or the developer who was
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
unhappy with the decision by Statute and
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
currently exists by Statute that
 
01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.290 align:start position:0%
currently exists by Statute that
um

01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
that appealing party has to decide
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
whether or not who has jurisdiction to
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
hear the appeal if it's a commercial
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
development it has to go to Superior
 
01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:49.139 align:start position:0%
Court if it is a housing project that
 
01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
party would have it have the decision to
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
decide whether they're going to go to
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
the land use appeals board or to
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and that's pretty much
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
the only thing where where it sort of
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
splits and then from either one of those
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
there's an appeal to the Supreme Court
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
if it is from the land use appeals board
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
did they make a decision that somebody
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
wants to appeal it's a discretionary
 
01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
appeal to the Supreme Court so the
 
01:34:19.129 --> 01:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court may or may not take that
 
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
appeal if it's a superior court decision
 
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's a mandatory appeal to the Supreme
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
Court and the Supreme Court at that
 
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
point does have to take that appeal
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
and sort of that's the the lineup it's
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
not a it probably wouldn't be a very I
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
don't know the diagram would help a lot
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be basically two
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
I think it would be helpful okay I mean
 
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
just listening to you explain it I mean
 
01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
I got kind of lost halfway through it
 
01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
fair enough I'm happy to work with with
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn and have something
 
01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
presented thank you so much okay sure
 
01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
much attorney ahead um
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
I'm inferring that the Assumption that's
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
halfway through the fiscal year is
 
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
because of the uh rather simple fact
 
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
which that the bill doesn't take effort
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
back to January 1st 2023 so uh which
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
will be assuming this gets to this
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee and all the other people
 
01:35:17.450 --> 01:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
against the governor's desk and he signs
 
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
um he probably wouldn't sign it until
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
you know June or July anyway so
 
01:35:23.639 --> 01:35:24.830 align:start position:0%
you know June or July anyway so
um

01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
will will the governor be able to the uh
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
Superior and the Chief Justice Superior
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
Court be able to start recruiting a
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
candidate for this post and submit the
 
01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:36.659 align:start position:0%
name to the council
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
before January 1st are they gonna have
 
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
to wait till January 1st of 2023 to
 
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
start the whole process going I I think
 
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
there's there's the the fiscal note
 
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
which sort of has a mechanical process I
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
think as a practical matter it probably
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't start on January 1 it would
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
start some period of time after so that
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
first you know in the partial fiscal
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
year it probably is a practical matter
 
01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even start till the beginning
 
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
of fiscal year 2024
 
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
um notwithstanding the effective date
 
01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
which also goes to you know the the
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
phrasing in the bill is
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
um that the uh
 
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court May establish the court
 
01:36:17.629 --> 01:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
it's really a process that has to go
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
through the the Chief Justice the
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and then ultimately the
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
the assuming that the court wanted the
 
01:36:25.729 --> 01:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
docket and created the docket there
 
01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
would have to be the appointment and the
 
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
rest of it so as a practical matter no
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh my question uh is I I don't
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
really have any doubt that
 
01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
it would be an improvement in the way
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
that land use cases are being held
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
I think the the issue I'm having is with
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court
 
01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:52.970 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court
and

01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
the fact they're not even having trials
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
this month
 
01:37:00.169 --> 01:37:00.179 align:start position:0%
and they are delayed in the manner in
 
01:37:01.729 --> 01:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
which they're handling lots of different
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
types of cases not just land use cases
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the question I have if
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
is I think and the the only really issue
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
I have with the bill
 
01:37:13.199 --> 01:37:14.689 align:start position:0%
I have with the bill
is

01:37:14.689 --> 01:37:14.699 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
if the superior court is going to be
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
given half a million dollars
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
what would its priority be would it be a
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
land use court or is there some other
 
01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
priority I well I thank you for the
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
question I think it's fair to say that
 
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
you know the legislative intent is to
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
create a if the if the legislature were
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
to pass this that this judge be
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the land docket so the in
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
the first instance it's the land docket
 
01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.149 align:start position:0%
the first instance it's the land docket
if

01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
if by chance there's free time they
 
01:37:45.169 --> 01:37:45.179 align:start position:0%
might take another case or two in in
 
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
non-land uh Appeals
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
but I think as a as sort of the the
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
commercial docket that was set up sort
 
01:37:58.490 --> 01:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
of demonstrated judge uh uh the the
 
01:38:00.370 --> 01:38:00.380 align:start position:0%
currently a different judge but the the
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
judges that have been appointed to that
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
position have taken as a priority those
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
you could read and you could write into
 
01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
the law that this would be the priority
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the judge but I think as a practical
 
01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
matter the purpose of setting up the
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
docket would be to to do that and not to
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
say great we have a new judge they're
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
not going to spend any time on the land
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
and the land appeals they're going to
 
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
spend it on civil cases
 
01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I I think the purpose of the
 
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
and we have one other person
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members and Mr
 
01:38:54.420 --> 01:39:01.729 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members and Mr
Moore

01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
oh sorry better thank you for the record
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Greg Moore I'm the state
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
director with Americans for Prosperity
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and I find myself
 
01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
in the unusual if not rare position
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
coming to the legislature to advocate
 
01:39:14.689 --> 01:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
for growing government but I think that
 
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
this is important this is uh definitely
 
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
an area where our state is being held
 
01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
back by the lack of of our ability to
 
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
quickly move on a lot of these issues
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
relative to land use issues
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
if you look I had a chance to talk to
 
01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
several land use attorneys I actually
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
encourage them to come in today as it
 
01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
turns out they were busy doing attorney
 
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
stuff but uh but uh what you what you
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
hear is is if you bring in a land use
 
01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
case to Superior Court it will often
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
take a year and a half before you
 
01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
actually get into court and oftentimes
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
as long as three years before you get a
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
final decision which means that
 
01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's a practical reality I mean it
 
01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
is a is a legal rally but it's not a
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
practical reality you can't actually get
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
Justice if you have to wait three years
 
01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
if you're a developer your financing
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
can't hold on for three years if you're
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
an individual who has an issue with a if
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
you're in a butter and you have an issue
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
is it worth the three years and the
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
legal cost to go that are associated
 
01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
with this so this for is a great way for
 
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
individuals to have a quick expeditious
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
venue to get resolution on on land use
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
issues I think the timelines are are
 
01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
extraordinary I think it's it's the
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
ability to get in and out of court in a
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
matter of five months would be in an
 
01:40:32.689 --> 01:40:32.699 align:start position:0%
extraordinary Improvement uh for for a
 
01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
lot of those a lot of folks who have
 
01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
that opportunity
 
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
and frankly we have a number of of towns
 
01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:41.540 align:start position:0%
that are making this land use decisions
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh that that frankly need to be need to
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity for quick judicial
 
01:40:49.729 --> 01:40:49.739 align:start position:0%
review I'm going to quote from um
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
Cordell Johnson who's the governor of
 
01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
Affairs Council from the New Hampshire
 
01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association he said he was
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
talking specifically about another bill
 
01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
legislation relative to Second Amendment
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
issues and towns enacting restrictions
 
01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
relative to Second Amendment issues but
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
talking about how these Town officials
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
are volunteers and that's absolutely
 
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
true you know our town government's work
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
on the basis of volunteers they wouldn't
 
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
work without a lot of committed people
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
dedicating their time
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
but he said with rare exceptions they're
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
not legal experts they're not lawyers
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
and they're not intimately familiar with
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
the limits of town Authority and so
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
towns inadvertently pass ordinances all
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
the time that may not be within their
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
Authority so we have local officials who
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
are overstepping their Authority
 
01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
but if you want to challenge that you
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
don't have a practical remedy to be able
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
to get into court and get quick
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
resolution and so uh House Bill 1389
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
helps resolve that problem I think one
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
of the one so the the speed with which
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
is is a huge Improvement I think the
 
01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
other huge advantage and I think the
 
01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
sponsor touched on it is that if you
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
have one Justice handling all these
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
cases as opposed to 20 21 22 justices
 
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
taking up land use cases you're going to
 
01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.669 align:start position:0%
taking up land use cases you're going to
very

01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
quickly and and get a very clear body of
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
case law that will help all these Town
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
officials make these decisions going
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
forward because you're going to have
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to have consistency as so
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
you have one judge ruling over and over
 
01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
again on these types of issues the state
 
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
will will uh will very quickly have a
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
clear sense of understanding of you know
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
what's inbounds what's out of bounds and
 
01:42:26.209 --> 01:42:26.219 align:start position:0%
that will help actually the local zoning
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
and planning boards I know that I know
 
01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.179 align:start position:0%
that we've been finding workarounds for
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
this issue I I think the housing appeals
 
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
board is a workaround for the fact you
 
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
couldn't get quick resolution I know
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander put legislation
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
in last year to mandate legal training
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
for for uh legal training for zoning and
 
01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
planning officials I think this is a
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
better solution it's a better solution
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
it gets us to to where we want to be
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
quickly as far as the volume of work I I
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't know I suspect that if there was
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for quick resolution you
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
would see more volume because I think
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people who simply
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
won't go to court because of the delays
 
01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
and cost associated with trying to get a
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
resolution through the superior court I
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
think that this you would quickly see a
 
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
higher degree of volume but I think that
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
as as I mentioned as there's a body of
 
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
case law that is quickly established I
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
think that volume would end up dropping
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
over the long term so uh I know you guys
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
are behind schedule so I don't want to
 
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
take any more time testifying so with
 
01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to take any questions
 
01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.350 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to take any questions
okay

01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.129 --> 01:43:34.139 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your time
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else would like to
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we will close the hearing
 
01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:51.659 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1389.
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
and we will take a eight-minute recess
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
to give everybody an opportunity to uh
 
01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
a brief opportunity to do what they need
 
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:43.629 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:44:43.629 --> 01:44:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.000 --> 01:52:14.689 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
we'll call the house Judiciary Committee
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
back to order
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
our next item of business today today is
 
01:52:35.209 --> 01:52:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor is representative
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
gay and representative gay would you
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
like to introduce your bill
 
01:52:44.450 --> 01:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:45.109 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
we after reviewing the bill after it was
 
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
finished was it was pointed out that
 
01:52:52.250 --> 01:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
ways it could be simplified so that's
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
why I've handed out the amended version
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
everybody already has one
 
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
okay I'll just read it real quickly it's
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
very short recordings of proceedings
 
01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
each party to a proceeding and family
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
each party till proceeding in a court in
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
a family court shall have the right to
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
make their own recordings of the
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
proceedings for comparison to the
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
official court recording each recording
 
01:53:33.649 --> 01:53:33.659 align:start position:0%
by the party shall be accompanied by a
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
document that identifies at what point
 
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
the party's recording differs from the
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
official court recording and shall be
 
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
admissible along with the official court
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
recording in an appeal where the
 
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
proceeding is relevant
 
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
apparently awkward the reason the need
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
is prompted by several people who have
 
01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
told me that when they
 
01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:08.330 align:start position:0%
told me that when they
purchased

01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
their copy
 
01:54:13.609 --> 01:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
of their proceedings the official
 
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
recording an official transcript there
 
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
were several things missing
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
well if they can't make their own
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
recording they can't prove it
 
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
so this way we don't change the law you
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
still have to if you file an appeal you
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
still have to submit the official
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
recording but if there's a difference
 
01:54:37.209 --> 01:54:37.219 align:start position:0%
you get to submit you're a recording too
 
01:54:40.129 --> 01:54:40.139 align:start position:0%
with a documentation that says where
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
they differ we don't expect people in
 
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
court to have to spend hours looking for
 
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
your questions will be helpful
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative Chase thank you
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative gay
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
I don't this just doesn't seem like um
 
01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
the right thing that you'd be able to do
 
01:55:13.250 --> 01:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
is just to record yourself why would
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
why would these people feel that
 
01:55:16.129 --> 01:55:16.139 align:start position:0%
something was taken out of the
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
transcripts because they have a memory
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to sound flippant but I
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
mean when when somebody when somebody in
 
01:55:27.169 --> 01:55:27.179 align:start position:0%
an authority says something to you that
 
01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
sounds off
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
you have no recourse
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
to show that it happened unless you have
 
01:55:37.870 --> 01:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
represent Chase so what you're saying is
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
in the instances that have been brought
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
to you when they did get the recorded
 
01:55:47.930 --> 01:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
piece that that flip remark or whatever
 
01:55:51.649 --> 01:55:51.659 align:start position:0%
was taken out so they they don't have
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
any way of tracking it
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
yes and they said that you can hear the
 
01:56:00.169 --> 01:56:00.179 align:start position:0%
clicks we used to have court
 
01:56:00.179 --> 01:56:01.729 align:start position:0%
clicks we used to have court
stenographers

01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
stenographers
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
but now
 
01:56:06.410 --> 01:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
I'm told but I I can't swear to this
 
01:56:08.990 --> 01:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
that the judge actually has a has a
 
01:56:11.570 --> 01:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
button that he turns it off and on and
 
01:56:14.330 --> 01:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
when they get the recordings and even
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
the transcripts show there's clicks
 
01:56:20.570 --> 01:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
and it'll even say it in the transcript
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
01:56:27.719 --> 01:56:30.530 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
gay

01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan well this is
 
01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
more more question of the chair which is
 
01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:35.209 align:start position:0%
more more question of the chair which is
um

01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:35.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're although they're not directly
 
01:56:39.290 --> 01:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
related to the issue they cited several
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
family law cases and one of them uh
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
Campbell versus Bush's partello Campbell
 
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
was a friend of mine I served with him
 
01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and I have a
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
discussed what's going on with himself
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
and his lawyers I mean I don't think
 
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's I mean I don't think I think I
 
01:56:57.649 --> 01:56:57.659 align:start position:0%
can still like consider this film
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
partially if I just thought I'd draw
 
01:57:00.770 --> 01:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
that attention to you and think there's
 
01:57:03.229 --> 01:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
if you think that might color the
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
objectivity of these proceedings but uh
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
I mean and either Campbell nor Campbell
 
01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
is definitely not here today I don't
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recognize partello if she
 
01:57:16.010 --> 01:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
showed up and that's probably these are
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
probably just be excited as examples of
 
01:57:20.089 --> 01:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
why this bill is needed more than uh
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
and they're kind of tangential to the
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
substance of the bills
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
just thought I'd Express I I see that I
 
01:57:29.770 --> 01:57:29.780 align:start position:0%
do have a concern here and I I
 
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
think you've done the the appropriate
 
01:57:37.010 --> 01:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
Thing by making a disclosure to it if
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
you feel that you have a conflict then
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
you will need to fill out a form yes as
 
01:57:45.169 --> 01:57:45.179 align:start position:0%
provided by the ethics guidelines okay
 
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
but if you do not feel you have a
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
conflict of course you don't have to do
 
01:57:52.129 --> 01:57:52.139 align:start position:0%
it but I think I'm okay but I just have
 
01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a doubt and I thought
 
01:57:54.890 --> 01:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'd just thought I'd let you know about
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
this I think uh the Disco disclosure is
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate and thank you very much okay
 
01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:00.770 align:start position:0%
appropriate and thank you very much okay
thanks

01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:58:06.169 --> 01:58:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
and in fact I will call Ms partello as
 
01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
our next witness thank you
 
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for the
 
01:58:25.970 --> 01:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity to allow me to testify
 
01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
before you
 
01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:30.179 align:start position:0%
um my name is Robin partello and I'm a
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:35.209 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:58:35.209 --> 01:58:35.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
to speak first about the recusal if
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's a question of any conflict of
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
interest I think the best course of
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
conduct would be to recuse yourself from
 
01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:48.169 align:start position:0%
conduct would be to recuse yourself from
um

01:58:48.169 --> 01:58:48.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:50.810 --> 01:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
this situation but that is ultimately
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
the decision of this panel and I'll
 
01:58:55.970 --> 01:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
respect whatever decision should be made
 
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
I'm here testifying in support of House
 
01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
Bill 1592 former judge Julian tricasso
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
altered my official court record in the
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
Nashua Family Division she was
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
eventually removed by the judicial
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
conduct committee and charged criminally
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Attorney General's
 
01:59:13.199 --> 01:59:13.970 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Attorney General's
office

01:59:13.970 --> 01:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1592 would bolster
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
accountability within the court system
 
01:59:21.890 --> 01:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
to preserve records into a short ensure
 
01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.810 align:start position:0%
to preserve records into a short ensure
accountability

01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
at this point I would welcome any
 
01:59:28.850 --> 01:59:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for MS partello
 
01:59:35.330 --> 01:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny
 
01:59:37.129 --> 01:59:37.139 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:59:39.169 --> 01:59:39.179 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:59:42.109 --> 01:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
um could you just explain because it
 
01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
seems like the judge that altered it was
 
01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
held accountable so what this bill would
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
do differently
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
um well
 
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
the judge what had happened was that the
 
01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
judge appointed her best friend Kathleen
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
Sternberg as a gal in my in my case and
 
02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
six months into it judge intercasso
 
02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
finally admitted that the guardian ad
 
02:00:07.250 --> 02:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
litem Kathleen Sternberg was her best
 
02:00:09.530 --> 02:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
friend Kathleen sternerberg at all
 
02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
junctures was not honest regarding my
 
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
payments So eventually I said I want to
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
send you an electronic payment
 
02:00:18.530 --> 02:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
she said I do not accept electronic
 
02:00:21.169 --> 02:00:21.179 align:start position:0%
payments I only accept cash or checks
 
02:00:23.330 --> 02:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
so I said
 
02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
this is the 21st century you know you
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
should accept electronic payments she
 
02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an office I can't mail cash
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
to her so she said
 
02:00:35.390 --> 02:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'll file a motion with the court and I
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
said okay you know the court is
 
02:00:41.689 --> 02:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
impartial and you know Julian tricasso
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
her best friend ruled on it and said
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
that I had to pay in cash or money order
 
02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
and then subsequently disclose the
 
02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:50.330 align:start position:0%
and then subsequently disclose the
conflict

02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
02:00:52.129 --> 02:00:52.139 align:start position:0%
so at this point I filed a complaint
 
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
with the judicial conduct committee and
 
02:00:57.169 --> 02:00:57.179 align:start position:0%
at this point Julian tricasso took my
 
02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
file into her office and Whited out the
 
02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
handwritten portion of where she told me
 
02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:05.270 align:start position:0%
handwritten portion of where she told me
that

02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
um Kathleen Sternberg should be paid by
 
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
cash or or check
 
02:01:12.830 --> 02:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
she also went on to blame me for this
 
02:01:14.570 --> 02:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
when she was investigated by the
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee which was a
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
slap in the face because that is not
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
something I would ever do and then she
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
blamed the court staff
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question I believe
 
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
that if the judges know that they are
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
accountable and they are not able to
 
02:01:33.050 --> 02:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
alter court records in any capacity I
 
02:01:34.450 --> 02:01:34.460 align:start position:0%
think it would
 
02:01:38.330 --> 02:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
ensure accountability and a generalized
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
oversight for the judges because you'll
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
hear other testimony behind me today
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
where judges or the transcripts were
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
actually altered and you know there were
 
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
items taken out and the process is when
 
02:01:54.109 --> 02:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
we as a litigant in the court system
 
02:01:57.709 --> 02:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
want to get our transcript we send a way
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
for it to a company in Arizona and they
 
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:01.860 align:start position:0%
provide us with a written transcript
 
02:02:04.129 --> 02:02:04.139 align:start position:0%
which looks something like this and it's
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
official court document so something
 
02:02:08.689 --> 02:02:08.699 align:start position:0%
like this costs about fifteen hundred
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
dollars to order and
 
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
as litigant you assume that everything
 
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
in this transcript is accurate right
 
02:02:20.089 --> 02:02:20.099 align:start position:0%
well we're finding it's not the judges
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
have discretion to stop the recording
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
you know and they're being altered so
 
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
we're forced to get
 
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
the CD and listen to the actual audio
 
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
and then go line by line and compare it
 
02:02:35.629 --> 02:02:35.639 align:start position:0%
to this which isn't fair so if we had
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to record we could get a
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
sense of confidence that we know that
 
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
everything in here is accurate without
 
02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
you know having to double check the
 
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
Judiciary which is something quite
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't think that litigants
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
should be responsible to ensure that the
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is being honest and ethical
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so much you're welcome
 
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from MS
 
02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:02.930 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from MS

and as a self-employed single mother it
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
can sometimes be tough to make ends meet
 
02:04:06.189 --> 02:04:06.199 align:start position:0%
I've had extensive legal bills totaling
 
02:04:09.169 --> 02:04:09.179 align:start position:0%
280 thousand dollars
 
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
and a lot of this does go back to
 
02:04:14.570 --> 02:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
getting all the transcripts that I've
 
02:04:16.330 --> 02:04:16.340 align:start position:0%
had to request

um that has been up to the New Hampshire
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court four times
 
02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
the docket number is
 
02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:33.729 align:start position:0%
the docket number is
2016-0478

02:04:33.729 --> 02:04:33.739 align:start position:0%
2016-0478
 
02:04:33.739 --> 02:04:36.310 align:start position:0%
2016-0478
2017-06.0063

02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
2017-06.0063
 
02:04:40.330 --> 02:04:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
2020-0152 so every time I went to the
 
02:04:46.129 --> 02:04:46.139 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court it they ruled and it was
 
02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
vacated back to the local Court
 
02:04:53.689 --> 02:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
so far over seven years of my life
 
02:04:57.050 --> 02:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
has been given to this court system I've
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
had 20 trial court hearings
 
02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
many before former judge Julie and
 
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.570 --> 02:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
I also have another hearing with oral
 
02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:15.770 align:start position:0%
I also have another hearing with oral
arguments

02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
arguments
 
02:05:19.070 --> 02:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
um on 10 26 had I should say had um or
 
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:23.219 align:start position:0%
arguments on 10 6 26 2017 that was
 
02:05:25.850 --> 02:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
before The Supreme Court I had yet
 
02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
another trial court date that was that
 
02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
may be rescheduled on January 18th which
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
is next week because I need to be here
 
02:05:34.609 --> 02:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
at twenty dollars twenty five dollars
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
per audio
 
02:05:42.649 --> 02:05:42.659 align:start position:0%
from the court that's about 550 dollars
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
right there
 
02:05:46.370 --> 02:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
just for the audio
 
02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm not presently even allowing
 
02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
allowed to record myself
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
so even if it's not needed for any
 
02:05:57.410 --> 02:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
appeal maybe a party or attorney just
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
wanted it for their own records to go
 
02:06:02.589 --> 02:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.570 --> 02:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
it's the party's own recorded is
 
02:06:08.209 --> 02:06:08.219 align:start position:0%
certainly not fair it's not good enough
 
02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:06:11.810 --> 02:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
um even if you don't know what these
 
02:06:13.970 --> 02:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
transcripts cost
 
02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
let me tell you they're very expensive
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
they're at least three dollars a page
 
02:06:21.530 --> 02:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
and when you have as many as I've had it
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
gets very very expensive
 
02:06:28.370 --> 02:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
in my case in Picasso also said that I'm
 
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
glad that you're trying to live the
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
All-American dream but go out and get a
 
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
real job
 
02:06:37.070 --> 02:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
and she clicked that off of the audio
 
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
when I went back with my attorney at the
 
02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:41.050 align:start position:0%
when I went back with my attorney at the
time

02:06:41.050 --> 02:06:41.060 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
to get the audio it was gone because she
 
02:06:47.410 --> 02:06:47.420 align:start position:0%
said that I should shut down my business
 
02:06:50.450 --> 02:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
and within six months and if I did not
 
02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
she was going to take away all child
 
02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
support and all alimony
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
and to me that's just not okay it's it's
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
part of the New Hampshire state law that
 
02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
when families separate both parents have
 
02:07:06.050 --> 02:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
an obligation to raise these children
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh the attorney like I said did ask for
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
the transcript which did not include
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
these condescending comments that was
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
actually stated from the judge that was
 
02:07:17.209 --> 02:07:17.219 align:start position:0%
said in the hearing
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh being able to make my own proceedings
 
02:07:21.169 --> 02:07:21.179 align:start position:0%
would allow me to hold the judge
 
02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
accountable Through The JCC complaint
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
for example which I've done not only
 
02:07:28.129 --> 02:07:28.139 align:start position:0%
with intercostal but I also did it with
 
02:07:28.139 --> 02:07:29.810 align:start position:0%
with intercostal but I also did it with
delpra

02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
delpra
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately I've had three bad
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
judges on my case so I go from one bad
 
02:07:38.209 --> 02:07:38.219 align:start position:0%
decision to the next to the next I have
 
02:07:41.810 --> 02:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
no way to independently confirm these
 
02:07:44.689 --> 02:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
statements from the court that the data
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
except the testimony from my former
 
02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
attorney who requested the transcript
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
he can confirm it was not on there but
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
recently when I went to Bruce delpra I
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
got the audio and he did specifically
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
say that I was
 
02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
a thorn in his side
 
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
he also said that he was the blessed one
 
02:08:07.250 --> 02:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
to hear my case
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
and he also said that he didn't want to
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
reopen a can of worms and that can of
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
worms was my reman that came back from
 
02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court that should have fixed
 
02:08:19.729 --> 02:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
my problems and this dated back to 2018
 
02:08:22.370 --> 02:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
I would have been out of the system
 
02:08:24.290 --> 02:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
but again because we didn't have these
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
audios until recently or didn't know
 
02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
that there was a problem with this
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
what do you do
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
so when I ordered my official audio and
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
transcripts on 12 13 of 21 from the
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
national Family Court from my last three
 
02:08:43.550 --> 02:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
hearings it was 75 dollars to prepare
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
for my upcoming hearing on the 18th of
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
next week
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
um it took the trial court until 1224 of
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
this year to get my audio so the day I
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
found out from Tim gutis of the Supreme
 
02:08:59.330 --> 02:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
Court that I had a hearing on January
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
18th myself and one of my friends went
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
on and we ordered the transcripts
 
02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:06.649 align:start position:0%
on and we ordered the transcripts
immediately

02:09:06.649 --> 02:09:06.659 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
to get them on time
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
I have to push out my court date next
 
02:09:11.930 --> 02:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
week because I don't have those
 
02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:13.070 align:start position:0%
week because I don't have those
transcripts

02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
transcripts
 
02:09:17.930 --> 02:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
so it's two weeks after the need date
 
02:09:22.010 --> 02:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
to even get an official audio from me in
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
each escribers is causing me not to have
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
the transcripts ready before this date
 
02:09:29.570 --> 02:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
so as you can see it's a real problem
 
02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:32.450 align:start position:0%
so as you can see it's a real problem
here

02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the current system compels a party
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
wanted or need in a transcript
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
transcript to engage in Commerce with
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
the private for-profit company and we're
 
02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
forced to pay these bills
 
02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
and what company charges whatever the
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
company charges we have no
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
say we need the transcript in order to
 
02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
go fight your battle in court
 
02:09:59.089 --> 02:09:59.099 align:start position:0%
and when you're making you can't even
 
02:10:02.570 --> 02:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
afford to make ends meet you're dumping
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
all these thousands of dollars on each
 
02:10:08.450 --> 02:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
audio and transcript
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
and let me remind you again that I had
 
02:10:13.250 --> 02:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
22 herons
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
and I ended up going to the Supreme
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
Court four times
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill prevents any party
 
02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
from getting audio and transcripts
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
through e-scribers or CD from the court
 
02:10:27.709 --> 02:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
like they've always done
 
02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
we just need to have the ability to have
 
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
some completion in in this business and
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
some more options for parties on a
 
02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:37.189 align:start position:0%
some more options for parties on a
budget

02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
or who need a same-day recording of the
 
02:10:43.609 --> 02:10:43.619 align:start position:0%
trial is unable to provide
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
but they could just record them
 
02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:46.669 align:start position:0%
but they could just record them
themselves

02:10:46.669 --> 02:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
so I'd be happy to take any further
 
02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions or comments
 
02:10:59.689 --> 02:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you so if you this went
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
through you're able to anybody can now
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
record would you
 
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
do it on your phone would you bring in a
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
an actual
 
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
recording device I mean to make sure
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's official yep the way I would do it
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
now just because everybody's leaning
 
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
towards on technology that they always
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
have everybody always has their cell
 
02:11:23.570 --> 02:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
phone on them
 
02:11:25.129 --> 02:11:25.139 align:start position:0%
um I would have probably done it through
 
02:11:27.430 --> 02:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
my cell phone just so I have that audio
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that could be uploaded to the
 
02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:32.089 align:start position:0%
and that could be uploaded to the
computer

02:11:32.089 --> 02:11:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
at least it would be accurate
 
02:11:38.930 --> 02:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today thank
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
Dana Albrecht
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'm pronouncing that
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.370 --> 02:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Dana
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
Albrecht and I'm a resident of Nashua
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:12:05.089 --> 02:12:05.099 align:start position:0%
some of you might have already heard
 
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
about my family law case which has
 
02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
received news coverage
 
02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
several times in the New Hampshire union
 
02:12:14.330 --> 02:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
leader as well as national news coverage
 
02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
in The Daily Beast and about which I
 
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
testified before house children and
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
family law committee two days ago in
 
02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
support of HB 32
 
02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
obviously today I'm here to testify in
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
support of HB 1592
 
02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:35.930 align:start position:0%
support of HB 1592
uh

02:12:35.930 --> 02:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
to allow parties to make recordings of
 
02:12:42.290 --> 02:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
their own hearings I have provided the
 
02:12:45.169 --> 02:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
committee with three exhibits
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
um those are not my testimony that
 
02:12:51.169 --> 02:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
simply evidence and support of some of
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
the things I'm testifying to
 
02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:55.790 align:start position:0%
the things I'm testifying to
um

02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:59.209 --> 02:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
so first I'd like to point out that this
 
02:13:02.089 --> 02:13:02.099 align:start position:0%
bill helps to address what has been an
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
ongoing problem for nearly 40 years
 
02:13:10.129 --> 02:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
and that it concerns both state and
 
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
federal due process rights and there's a
 
02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
federal due process rights and there's a
couple

02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
couple
 
02:13:17.209 --> 02:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
decisions from both our New Hampshire
 
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and the first circuit
 
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
federal court of appeals that I think
 
02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
are pretty relevant
 
02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
to the committee reviewing this bill
 
02:13:32.450 --> 02:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
and those are an exhibit one which is
 
02:13:36.109 --> 02:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
Whit fee justices of New Hampshire
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
from the court of appeals Federal
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:13:46.609 --> 02:13:46.619 align:start position:0%
confirth of econforth which is a state
 
02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision again you can
 
02:13:51.649 --> 02:13:51.659 align:start position:0%
look at those later I just think they're
 
02:13:51.659 --> 02:13:53.990 align:start position:0%
look at those later I just think they're
relevant

02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:13:59.330 --> 02:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
wit in like a federal due process
 
02:14:01.729 --> 02:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
addresses how a New Hampshire family
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
court judge
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
is supposed to review the
 
02:14:07.609 --> 02:14:07.619 align:start position:0%
recommendations of a marital master and
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
what sort of the record is supposed to
 
02:14:12.530 --> 02:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
look like and I think this bill really
 
02:14:16.810 --> 02:14:16.820 align:start position:0%
is speaking about what the record is
 
02:14:20.569 --> 02:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
and that federal case in turn cites
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
conferth which is a 1983 family court
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
case that was Tried by
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh marital master Bruce dalpra and the
 
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
key there in that case is no recording
 
02:14:38.209 --> 02:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
or stenographic record was ever made at
 
02:14:38.219 --> 02:14:39.470 align:start position:0%
or stenographic record was ever made at
all

02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a problem
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to essentially present an
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
argument to you that this is
 
02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
not a one-time incident it's an ongoing
 
02:14:56.089 --> 02:14:56.099 align:start position:0%
problem since then starting 40 years ago
 
02:14:56.099 --> 02:14:58.069 align:start position:0%
problem since then starting 40 years ago
uh

02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:58.079 --> 02:15:01.129 align:start position:0%
uh
so

02:15:01.129 --> 02:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:01.139 --> 02:15:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
I think

02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:15:04.609 --> 02:15:04.619 align:start position:0%
my question to the committee is does
 
02:15:04.619 --> 02:15:06.350 align:start position:0%
my question to the committee is does
anyone

02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
almost rhetorically care that we don't
 
02:15:10.729 --> 02:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
even have
 
02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:17.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:15:17.770 --> 02:15:17.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
and you know mastered out Prof from corn
 
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
forth 40 years ago no audio fast forward
 
02:15:27.290 --> 02:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
today he's my marital Master judge in my
 
02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:28.149 align:start position:0%
today he's my marital Master judge in my
case

02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:15:32.810 --> 02:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
and uh his attitude on the record is who
 
02:15:36.050 --> 02:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
gives an F concerning my testimony and
 
02:15:39.709 --> 02:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:39.719 --> 02:15:40.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:15:40.250 --> 02:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to also argue that
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
again not isolated incidents that's a
 
02:15:49.850 --> 02:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
key point
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
so I'm also one of nine family law cases
 
02:15:57.310 --> 02:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
in which former judge Julian tricasso
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
appointed her best friend Kathleen
 
02:16:03.890 --> 02:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
sternenberg is Guardian Ad Litem uh you
 
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from Robin earlier on
 
02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:08.930 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from Robin earlier on
that

02:16:08.930 --> 02:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:09.830 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:11.890 --> 02:16:11.900 align:start position:0%
if the
 
02:16:14.750 --> 02:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh I would refer the committee to
 
02:16:16.990 --> 02:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
exhibit to
 
02:16:19.970 --> 02:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
which contains a list of those nine
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
family law cases with case names and
 
02:16:23.330 --> 02:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
docket numbers
 
02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
again you can look at it later
 
02:16:29.689 --> 02:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
uh and some correspondence from the
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
clerk of the court
 
02:16:33.410 --> 02:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
concerning some of those
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
again to support what I'm I'm telling
 
02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:37.730 align:start position:0%
again to support what I'm I'm telling
you

02:16:37.730 --> 02:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:16:42.009 --> 02:16:42.019 align:start position:0%
um so I've requested audio recordings
 
02:16:44.509 --> 02:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
from the court hearings of several of
 
02:16:44.519 --> 02:16:45.589 align:start position:0%
from the court hearings of several of
these

02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:16:45.599 --> 02:16:46.669 align:start position:0%
these
cases

02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:16:50.209 --> 02:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
and in two of them there's been several
 
02:16:53.810 --> 02:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
hearings where once again there's no
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
audio available from the trial court
 
02:16:59.089 --> 02:16:59.099 align:start position:0%
hearing at all
 
02:17:01.610 --> 02:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
so we're not even talking comparison
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking missing
 
02:17:06.410 --> 02:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that's particularly
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
disturbing in the Sobel case
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh because once again that's a final
 
02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
hearing before Master Dal pra Kathleen
 
02:17:20.030 --> 02:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
sternenberg was there and where's the
 
02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:21.770 align:start position:0%
sternenberg was there and where's the
audio

02:17:21.770 --> 02:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
audio
 
02:17:25.209 --> 02:17:25.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
and again in support of what I'm saying
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
that just please you can look at the
 
02:17:33.889 --> 02:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
letters from clerk Sherry bison in
 
02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
exhibit 2. you know confirming that they
 
02:17:40.009 --> 02:17:40.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.019 --> 02:17:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
so in my own case before the New
 
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:47.450 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court
uh

02:17:47.450 --> 02:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:50.450 --> 02:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
pretty much the critical issue in the
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
case so far
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh was that the official transcript
 
02:17:59.089 --> 02:17:59.099 align:start position:0%
admitted key portions of the audio
 
02:17:59.099 --> 02:18:00.530 align:start position:0%
admitted key portions of the audio
uh

02:18:00.530 --> 02:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:02.330 align:start position:0%
uh
and

02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
that was crucial to the Supreme Court's
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
resulting decision to vacate
 
02:18:10.610 --> 02:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
and remand
 
02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
and we had to go back to East scribers
 
02:18:14.209 --> 02:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
and we had to go back and we had to
 
02:18:17.530 --> 02:18:17.540 align:start position:0%
compare all this stuff to figure out
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
discrepancies that was the issue one of
 
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.429 --> 02:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:18:31.310 --> 02:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
I realized there's an amendment today a
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
revised version but
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
the point about poor quality recordings
 
02:18:37.849 --> 02:18:37.859 align:start position:0%
are non-professional creative
 
02:18:40.129 --> 02:18:40.139 align:start position:0%
transcripts to be submitted to the
 
02:18:43.009 --> 02:18:43.019 align:start position:0%
record on a PL I kind of think that's a
 
02:18:44.810 --> 02:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
red herring in light of the amendment
 
02:18:48.049 --> 02:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
what we're really talking about is the
 
02:18:50.570 --> 02:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
ability of parties just to make their
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
own stuff in case they feel there's an
 
02:18:57.410 --> 02:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.420 --> 02:18:58.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:18:58.250 --> 02:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
and again you know why should escribers
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
have a monopoly I paid them almost eight
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:08.509 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
for

02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
the transcript that left out the most
 
02:19:13.849 --> 02:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:13.859 --> 02:19:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:17.929 --> 02:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
and again to Echo Vivian nothing in this
 
02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
bill prevents any room we just can
 
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
continue to order audio and transcripts
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
from escribers the way we do but there's
 
02:19:29.209 --> 02:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
no reason that we should be denied the
 
02:19:31.690 --> 02:19:31.700 align:start position:0%
right to make their own recording
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
or denied the right to have
 
02:19:37.849 --> 02:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
another transcription company
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know transcribe it if maybe we just
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
need something of lower quality super
 
02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
fast I'll just close with one example I
 
02:19:49.490 --> 02:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
had a telephonic hearing two days ago
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
I'm still waiting on the audio I'm still
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
waiting on the official transcript sure
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
I want it from escribe or sure I want it
 
02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
official from the court but it sure
 
02:20:00.170 --> 02:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
would have been helpful to just hit
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
record on my phone and send it off to
 
02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
speech pad and have something good
 
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
enough just for me
 
02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
you know 12 24 hours later
 
02:20:16.610 --> 02:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
um so uh thank you for your time and at
 
02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
this point I'd like to answer any
 
02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:20.090 align:start position:0%
this point I'd like to answer any
questions

02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:27.650 --> 02:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
I think you did a thorough job with your
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.370 --> 02:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
02:20:46.610 --> 02:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Richard head
 
02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
I'm the government Affairs coordinator
 
02:20:50.929 --> 02:20:50.939 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch
 
02:20:50.939 --> 02:20:52.670 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch
um

02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:55.370 --> 02:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
I haven't actually seen
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
um representative Gay's amendment I just
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
heard about her talk about it today
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
which helped at least clarify what she
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
was intending with this bill
 
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
there there are a number of of different
 
02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
points of views and things that were
 
02:21:10.490 --> 02:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
were described and thank you
 
02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:12.050 align:start position:0%
were described and thank you
representative

02:21:12.050 --> 02:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:21:14.090 --> 02:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
um that were described in in the
 
02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
testimony today some of them dealt with
 
02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
a judge judge intercasso who was
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
convicted of of criminal wrongdoing she
 
02:21:24.770 --> 02:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
was brought before the judicial conduct
 
02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
committee and she is no longer a judge
 
02:21:33.290 --> 02:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not she did bad things I met with
 
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
some of the clerks you heard Miss
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
partello talk about who were also
 
02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
accused of of modifying documents those
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
are written documents
 
02:21:45.530 --> 02:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
um and I I understand sort of how she
 
02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
felt about it by having also spoken with
 
02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
those clerks I'm not trying to in any
 
02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
way talk about those types of of
 
02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
incidents what we're talking about here
 
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
is what is the erector and what is the
 
02:21:59.570 --> 02:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
official record when you go on appeal
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
and those are governed by court rules
 
02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court has rules as to
 
02:22:06.410 --> 02:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
what is the record that is before The
 
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and that involves a
 
02:22:10.429 --> 02:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
transcript and the transcript process
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
and and you were you that was accurately
 
02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
described to you is
 
02:22:18.590 --> 02:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
um when you file a notice of appeal part
 
02:22:21.050 --> 02:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
of that is an estimate of what is the
 
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
cost of the transcript uh the state has
 
02:22:26.210 --> 02:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
a contract with a company called
 
02:22:30.050 --> 02:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
escribers and the official recording is
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
sent to escribers for transcription
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
process I've used multiple times in in
 
02:22:36.889 --> 02:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
cases that I've appealed
 
02:22:40.130 --> 02:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
um and and I also
 
02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
at one point over last summer I did a
 
02:22:46.250 --> 02:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
comparison of the cost that we incur for
 
02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
transcriptions the cost of
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
transcriptions for appeals because again
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
the record on appeal is the transcript
 
02:22:55.490 --> 02:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
not the audio recording absent some
 
02:22:58.190 --> 02:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstance in our cost of
 
02:23:01.010 --> 02:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
transcripts are either cheaper or
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
Incredibly Close to the costs of
 
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
transcripts and all of the other New
 
02:23:08.809 --> 02:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
England states it's it not exactly in
 
02:23:11.450 --> 02:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples comparison because the
 
02:23:14.330 --> 02:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
turnaround time in the cost is is a
 
02:23:15.889 --> 02:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
little bit variable the faster the
 
02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
turnaround time the higher the cost but
 
02:23:21.290 --> 02:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
at least our costs of transcripts are
 
02:23:23.809 --> 02:23:23.819 align:start position:0%
comparable to those around in the New
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
England states
 
02:23:27.410 --> 02:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here and is is
 
02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
both the original bill in which the
 
02:23:32.510 --> 02:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
audio recording would become the record
 
02:23:36.170 --> 02:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
for appeal and then in the amendment
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
um from representative gay would be to
 
02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
allow the parties to record to sort of
 
02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
confirm the the transcript
 
02:23:46.190 --> 02:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
and at least that makes a little bit
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
more sense than the original because if
 
02:23:50.809 --> 02:23:50.819 align:start position:0%
we have for example you know you can
 
02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
have a multi-day hearing and Family
 
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
Division and you know you would be
 
02:23:59.330 --> 02:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
sending up to the to the justices you
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
know four days of audio recordings to
 
02:24:04.250 --> 02:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
try to figure out what was the key point
 
02:24:07.309 --> 02:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to get to or if a
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
particular point of in time in the
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
recording is identified by the parties
 
02:24:14.330 --> 02:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
the justices still look at the entire
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
record because they need to be able to
 
02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
put that into the proper context to
 
02:24:20.450 --> 02:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
determine you know what is what is what
 
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
they're being directed at is it in fact
 
02:24:24.770 --> 02:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
consistent with the rest of the record
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever the Appellate issue may be
 
02:24:29.330 --> 02:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
and that is done and it has been done
 
02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
for for uh
 
02:24:34.370 --> 02:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
it it's always been done in terms of the
 
02:24:35.889 --> 02:24:35.899 align:start position:0%
written transcript and the written
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
written record below and that is
 
02:24:42.170 --> 02:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
established by Court rule if there is a
 
02:24:44.330 --> 02:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
desire to change what is the official
 
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
record that should really be done by a
 
02:24:48.349 --> 02:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
Court rule and there is a rules
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee and there's a member of the
 
02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
the court rules committee and there's a
 
02:24:53.929 --> 02:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
member of the House of Representatives
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
on that committee and there's a member
 
02:24:57.050 --> 02:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
member of the state senate on that
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee and really those types of
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
things as to what is the official record
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
should be done by rule not by a statute
 
02:25:06.410 --> 02:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
because it ultimately takes into account
 
02:25:09.650 --> 02:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
a a wide variety of concerns and issues
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
so you know in terms of identifying and
 
02:25:15.230 --> 02:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
determining what the record is I would
 
02:25:17.690 --> 02:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
suggest that the the proper process is
 
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
through the through the court rules and
 
02:25:23.050 --> 02:25:23.060 align:start position:0%
if somebody has a specific idea or issue
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
present that idea or issue to the rules
 
02:25:27.530 --> 02:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
committee that could be then adopted as
 
02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
as an official rule
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
the the issue of
 
02:25:34.730 --> 02:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
to take another step back though is is
 
02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about quote unquote
 
02:25:39.410 --> 02:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
Family Court Family Court doesn't
 
02:25:41.570 --> 02:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
actually exist now we're talking about a
 
02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
division of the Circuit Court Family
 
02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:44.150 align:start position:0%
division of the Circuit Court Family
Division

02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
Division
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
and Family Division does not have with
 
02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
very few exceptions dedicated judges so
 
02:25:52.250 --> 02:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
you have family judges that are also
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
hearing criminal cases that are also
 
02:25:55.849 --> 02:25:55.859 align:start position:0%
hearing civil cases that are hearing a
 
02:25:59.690 --> 02:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
whole host of of cases roughly about 125
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
000 cases a year
 
02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
um in some budget cutting moves that
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
were made a number of years ago of Court
 
02:26:09.770 --> 02:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
monitors were eliminated from the
 
02:26:11.809 --> 02:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court in Superior Court we still
 
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
have court monitors they operate the
 
02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
equipment they manage the equipment in
 
02:26:18.050 --> 02:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court we do not currently have
 
02:26:20.570 --> 02:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
court monitors so as you heard in the
 
02:26:22.490 --> 02:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
testimony which was accurate the judges
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
are turning on and off the equipment
 
02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:26:29.210 --> 02:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
and I'm not questioning this happens
 
02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:31.490 align:start position:0%
and I'm not questioning this happens
um

02:26:31.490 --> 02:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:33.650 --> 02:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
I won't go to the intent of any judge
 
02:26:36.290 --> 02:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
especially judging tricasso I will say
 
02:26:38.570 --> 02:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
though that obviously mistakes get made
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
because you have a judge who has a room
 
02:26:43.490 --> 02:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
full of of parties the judge has papers
 
02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
coming in and out they're signing orders
 
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing a lot of stuff sometimes
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
that button does not get hit I don't I
 
02:26:52.010 --> 02:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
don't question that Court monitors would
 
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate that issue it is a cost though
 
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
in a cost cutting
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
effort eliminated those in the past
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
bringing those back certainly brings a
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
professionalism and a stability uh to
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
that position and and ensures that
 
02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
somebody is dedicated to that purpose
 
02:27:11.330 --> 02:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
and that may help create more accurate
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
more complete audio recordings which
 
02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
would then be what e-scribers is relying
 
02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:19.309 align:start position:0%
would then be what e-scribers is relying
upon

02:27:19.309 --> 02:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
upon
 
02:27:20.929 --> 02:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
as to the goal that they're talking
 
02:27:23.570 --> 02:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
about in terms of in the amendment that
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
was presented today
 
02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
again that makes a little more sense
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
I've certainly had instances in which
 
02:27:31.490 --> 02:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
I've received an e-transcript or a
 
02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
triber subscriber transcript in which
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
they said something was unintelligible I
 
02:27:38.090 --> 02:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
thought it was intelligible
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I had the recording and I
 
02:27:42.650 --> 02:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
had the transcript and I filed a motion
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
I said I think this actually is and
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
here's the recording here's the point in
 
02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:48.590 align:start position:0%
here's the recording here's the point in
time

02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
judges don't love that
 
02:27:53.290 --> 02:27:53.300 align:start position:0%
um but I've also been able to work with
 
02:27:55.969 --> 02:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
transcription services to say hey can
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
you go back you know this is this is
 
02:27:59.929 --> 02:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
what I hear can you re-listen to this
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
particular point in time because again
 
02:28:03.710 --> 02:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
they're doing the whole transcript if
 
02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
you can focus them back where they said
 
02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
unintelligible sometimes you can get
 
02:28:09.650 --> 02:28:09.660 align:start position:0%
them to re-listen but these are
 
02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
certified transcribers they have their
 
02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
own professional ethics they have their
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
own duties as to sort of what they can
 
02:28:18.830 --> 02:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
put into the transcript or what they
 
02:28:21.050 --> 02:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
determine to be unintelligible and that
 
02:28:25.849 --> 02:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.130 --> 02:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
the idea of of being able to compare
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
makes more sense if that self-recorded
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
on the phone thing is not the official
 
02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
record but is for the parties to be able
 
02:28:39.170 --> 02:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
to then compare to what is the official
 
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
record there is a process currently for
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
seeking permission to record in a
 
02:28:47.809 --> 02:28:47.819 align:start position:0%
courtroom and there is a a form that can
 
02:28:50.410 --> 02:28:50.420 align:start position:0%
be filed and and recordings can be made
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
with permission currently but again if
 
02:28:56.450 --> 02:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
there should be a rule change my
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
suggestion is it's not best handled
 
02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
through legislation but handled through
 
02:29:03.050 --> 02:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
the rules committee and those can be
 
02:29:04.490 --> 02:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
brought forward by the representative
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
member who is representative Birch or
 
02:29:09.290 --> 02:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
through the senator Senate member
 
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie in those ideas and those
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
issues can be presented I will not say
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
that these records are without failures
 
02:29:21.050 --> 02:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
at times certainly it happens and that
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
can be problematic in terms of what is
 
02:29:25.490 --> 02:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
the official record when it goes to the
 
02:29:27.530 --> 02:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
but that said
 
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
I think it creates significant problems
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
where you have
 
02:29:38.690 --> 02:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
litigant managed recordings being done
 
02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
in a on a telephone that somehow becomes
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
the official record I think that's just
 
02:29:47.570 --> 02:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
one not practical two can itself lead to
 
02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
abuse and and three is really not the
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
proper procedure for determining what is
 
02:29:55.490 --> 02:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
the official record and thank you Mr
 
02:29:56.809 --> 02:29:56.819 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:29:56.819 --> 02:29:58.429 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd be happy to answer any
questions

02:29:58.429 --> 02:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative Chase thank you very
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
much thanks for taking my question so
 
02:30:06.590 --> 02:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there is an option to
 
02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
seek permission to make recordings why
 
02:30:11.570 --> 02:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
what is that procedure and why aren't
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
people doing that and I would be afraid
 
02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
if I were we were allowed to record and
 
02:30:20.090 --> 02:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
you're in a family courtroom type of
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
setting that anybody could be recording
 
02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
you you're not there by yourself there's
 
02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
other people waiting in the galley and
 
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's clearly part of the
 
02:30:29.690 --> 02:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
problem in some of the issues that
 
02:30:33.650 --> 02:30:33.660 align:start position:0%
especially in in Family Division where
 
02:30:36.050 --> 02:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
you have some very personal very
 
02:30:38.990 --> 02:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
sensitive things that are being said and
 
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
that recording is not in the Court's
 
02:30:43.610 --> 02:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
control so it gets posted on the
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
internet you know who's recording what
 
02:30:47.929 --> 02:30:47.939 align:start position:0%
is being recorded is it being recorded
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
just you know what's at the table or are
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
you also hearing what's going on behind
 
02:30:55.010 --> 02:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
you you know we do not have control over
 
02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
those recordings and at that point it is
 
02:31:01.730 --> 02:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
for the individual who did the recording
 
02:31:03.889 --> 02:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
to do with it as they wish so in Family
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
Division it is a more limited ability to
 
02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
to make personal recordings I don't
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
question that and I don't know that that
 
02:31:13.309 --> 02:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
is for a good reason because of the just
 
02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
the very nature of what is frequently
 
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
being said in those in those proceedings
 
02:31:19.969 --> 02:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
but you also then have the sort of
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
secondary issue of is it picking up
 
02:31:25.429 --> 02:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
conversations that are going on around
 
02:31:27.530 --> 02:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
that person who is recording and those
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
people are unaware that they're being
 
02:31:33.050 --> 02:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
recorded so certainly a whole host of
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
potential unintended consequences from
 
02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
from doing that sort of thing thank you
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
02:31:42.830 --> 02:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Chase I'm sorry but
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
the other part of it what you said
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's an option to seek permission to
 
02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
make recordings what is that how what
 
02:31:52.250 --> 02:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
does that entail and how easy would it
 
02:31:54.050 --> 02:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
be for someone knowing that they're
 
02:31:56.330 --> 02:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
having a hearing knowing they've had an
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
issue just to ask for that permission
 
02:32:00.650 --> 02:32:00.660 align:start position:0%
just I've never actually done it it's
 
02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
typically used and I'll take a step back
 
02:32:05.650 --> 02:32:05.660 align:start position:0%
it is it's primarily there for media
 
02:32:08.330 --> 02:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
because these are public proceedings the
 
02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
media wants to have a recording so I
 
02:32:12.050 --> 02:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
will say that's sort of the reason why
 
02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
it went up but
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
um but there's nothing that prohibits a
 
02:32:18.410 --> 02:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
party from making a motion to uh to ask
 
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
for a recording but again in these
 
02:32:23.389 --> 02:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
contexts it is not necessarily
 
02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for a judge to deny that
 
02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
that type of request given the nature of
 
02:32:30.410 --> 02:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
the proceedings
 
02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:34.010 align:start position:0%
the proceedings
it

02:32:34.010 --> 02:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:37.610 --> 02:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.130 --> 02:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me that there are really
 
02:32:43.250 --> 02:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
two parts to the issue here one is the
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
ability of at least a party to be able
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
to make a recording of the proceeding
 
02:32:51.530 --> 02:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
and the other part is
 
02:32:54.050 --> 02:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
the ability to use that recording as
 
02:32:57.230 --> 02:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
evidence and some further proceeding I
 
02:32:58.849 --> 02:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
think that's right and that's sort of
 
02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
the split between the bill as presented
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
and the and the amended version from
 
02:33:05.870 --> 02:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
from representative gay and so I guess
 
02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:07.849 align:start position:0%
from representative gay and so I guess
uh

02:33:07.849 --> 02:33:07.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:07.859 --> 02:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
uh
my

02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:10.490 align:start position:0%
my
my

02:33:10.490 --> 02:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:33:12.770 --> 02:33:12.780 align:start position:0%
and perhaps and
 
02:33:15.469 --> 02:33:15.479 align:start position:0%
you've acknowledged and frankly it's my
 
02:33:17.210 --> 02:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
experience as well that there are
 
02:33:19.370 --> 02:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
circumstances where recordings aren't
 
02:33:21.889 --> 02:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
made or even when they are made they're
 
02:33:26.290 --> 02:33:26.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:29.050 --> 02:33:29.060 align:start position:0%
why why would it be
 
02:33:32.210 --> 02:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
offensive to not necessarily allow
 
02:33:34.370 --> 02:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
everyone in the courtroom but allow at
 
02:33:37.010 --> 02:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
least a party to be able to record the
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
proceedings so that they would have
 
02:33:41.690 --> 02:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
something that would be an accurate
 
02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
representation of what took place
 
02:33:46.849 --> 02:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it would be offensive uh
 
02:33:49.690 --> 02:33:49.700 align:start position:0%
what what I I think the question is
 
02:33:55.010 --> 02:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:57.530 --> 02:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
how is the Integrity of that recording
 
02:33:59.809 --> 02:33:59.819 align:start position:0%
itself being maintained
 
02:33:59.819 --> 02:34:01.250 align:start position:0%
itself being maintained
um

02:34:01.250 --> 02:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:03.770 --> 02:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
but I'm not denying there may not be a
 
02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
process for for allowing for I'm not
 
02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:07.550 align:start position:0%
process for for allowing for I'm not
sure

02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:34:09.650 --> 02:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
legislation of this type is is the
 
02:34:11.870 --> 02:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
proper mechanism I think the better path
 
02:34:15.230 --> 02:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
is to is to work within the the court
 
02:34:17.690 --> 02:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
system and the Court rule process and
 
02:34:20.090 --> 02:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
develop a procedure that protects the
 
02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
interests of the parties protects the
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
interests of those who are in the
 
02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
courtroom and uh protects the Integrity
 
02:34:31.250 --> 02:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
of the record but as to the sort of over
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
overarching issue
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
if if you know
 
02:34:39.290 --> 02:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
actually two other two other points one
 
02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
is you know the court monitor issue is
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
is one of the things that would improve
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
the quality and the in ensuring a
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
complete record is is being recorded
 
02:34:55.490 --> 02:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.010 --> 02:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
I I guess that's that's primarily it
 
02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:06.050 --> 02:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
and uh and I I hate to dwell on it but
 
02:35:07.849 --> 02:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
you've indicated it should be done
 
02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
through the Court rule making process as
 
02:35:12.830 --> 02:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to the legislature but
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't someone have to in the court
 
02:35:17.270 --> 02:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process be committed to do
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
that in order for that rule to happen
 
02:35:21.530 --> 02:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
well I think I mean part of it I mean
 
02:35:23.090 --> 02:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
right now I think there's nothing that
 
02:35:24.950 --> 02:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
prohibits a party from making a motion I
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
think the court needing the judge
 
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
needing be able to one control what's
 
02:35:31.790 --> 02:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
going on in the courtroom control sort
 
02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:33.170 align:start position:0%
going on in the courtroom control sort
of

02:35:33.170 --> 02:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:35:36.650 --> 02:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
what is being recorded is an important
 
02:35:39.889 --> 02:35:39.899 align:start position:0%
aspect of of ensuring that all of the
 
02:35:42.590 --> 02:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
interests and rights of the the parties
 
02:35:45.410 --> 02:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
the witnesses and those who are just
 
02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
present in the courtroom are protected
 
02:35:49.309 --> 02:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing I'm aware of nothing
 
02:35:50.690 --> 02:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
maybe you're aware of anything of
 
02:35:52.610 --> 02:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
something that would prohibit a party
 
02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
from asking a judge and raising it with
 
02:35:59.210 --> 02:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
the judge asking to record a procedure
 
02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'm simply unaware of anything that
 
02:36:02.570 --> 02:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
would prohibit that undercurrent under
 
02:36:04.490 --> 02:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
current rules
 
02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
so if if there have been instances where
 
02:36:10.190 --> 02:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
in a particular case things have not
 
02:36:11.929 --> 02:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
been recorded
 
02:36:11.939 --> 02:36:12.530 align:start position:0%
been recorded
um

02:36:12.530 --> 02:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:15.410 --> 02:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
I would make a motion and then I think
 
02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
you get to the what you might hear is I
 
02:36:19.250 --> 02:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
don't trust my judge I think my judge is
 
02:36:21.290 --> 02:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
doing it deliberately
 
02:36:23.330 --> 02:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
when I will take Judge Andrew Caso out
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
of the conversation we have incredibly
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
good judges we have incredibly dedicated
 
02:36:31.150 --> 02:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
judges they are remarkably busy people
 
02:36:35.090 --> 02:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of caseload stress load and and
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
the types of cases they're dealing with
 
02:36:38.389 --> 02:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
and the types of parties they're dealing
 
02:36:41.809 --> 02:36:41.819 align:start position:0%
with okay and and but I do think they
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
are fair and they want to do what's
 
02:36:45.710 --> 02:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
helpful for the for the participants so
 
02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
I would say current process allows for a
 
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
recording but it has to be done with
 
02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
permission of the of the trial judge
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:36:59.050 --> 02:36:59.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:00.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
and

02:37:00.950 --> 02:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative David love wishes to
 
02:37:03.359 --> 02:37:08.870 align:start position:0%
representative David love wishes to
testify

02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
02:37:12.530 --> 02:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name is
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative David love I represent
 
02:37:18.170 --> 02:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
Rockingham six which is Derry and uh
 
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
I guess I can start out with one
 
02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
statement as as uh as somebody that's
 
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
been abused by the family court here in
 
02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our family quotes are a
 
02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:28.370 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our family quotes are a
mess

02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
mess
 
02:37:32.210 --> 02:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
okay uh for me um the the best thing we
 
02:37:33.469 --> 02:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
could ever do
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
was really narrow down judicial
 
02:37:38.330 --> 02:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
discretion and this is this this bill
 
02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
here will stop that you know it'll it'll
 
02:37:43.730 --> 02:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
it'll help to fix it when a judge can
 
02:37:45.770 --> 02:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
sit there and say I don't want that to
 
02:37:47.330 --> 02:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
be part of the record
 
02:37:48.830 --> 02:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
okay and he holds his finger on the
 
02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
button that's wrong you know people's
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
lives are at risk here
 
02:37:56.330 --> 02:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
um you know kids lives are at risk look
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
at the mess these kids are today you
 
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
know drug abuse uh you know 12 and 13
 
02:38:04.010 --> 02:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
year olds having sex uh you know failing
 
02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:05.819 align:start position:0%
schools all the rest of it you know our
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
family quotes are a big part of that
 
02:38:10.370 --> 02:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
you know and anything we can do
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
to make to set the record straight
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
because that's what we're doing if we
 
02:38:14.990 --> 02:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
allow a judge to take put his finger on
 
02:38:16.849 --> 02:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
that button that record isn't straight
 
02:38:16.859 --> 02:38:17.929 align:start position:0%
that button that record isn't straight
anymore

02:38:17.929 --> 02:38:17.939 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
02:38:20.690 --> 02:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
you know we we have to
 
02:38:22.730 --> 02:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
we have to put this this in because they
 
02:38:24.170 --> 02:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
don't pay attention to rules they break
 
02:38:26.210 --> 02:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
down but they have judicial discretion
 
02:38:28.370 --> 02:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
you know I can break my own rules
 
02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know the when the the gentleman
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
before me was talking I was thinking you
 
02:38:33.050 --> 02:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
know all we're doing is asking the fox
 
02:38:34.610 --> 02:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
to mind the hen house
 
02:38:36.530 --> 02:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
you know we've got to stop that family
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
court is a mess you know they need
 
02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:40.429 align:start position:0%
court is a mess you know they need
written

02:38:40.429 --> 02:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
written laws written statute that they
 
02:38:44.929 --> 02:38:44.939 align:start position:0%
have to go by or it's going to continue
 
02:38:46.190 --> 02:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
and continue
 
02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
you know my family's been up and been
 
02:38:50.809 --> 02:38:50.819 align:start position:0%
victimized by uh you know the family
 
02:38:52.730 --> 02:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
courts not just not not just my my
 
02:38:54.530 --> 02:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
personal my brothers you know stuff like
 
02:38:56.809 --> 02:38:56.819 align:start position:0%
that uh you know I I have one brother
 
02:38:59.210 --> 02:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
that uh you know his third his 30 year
 
02:39:01.130 --> 02:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
old son well you know when he was eight
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
or so uh went through this whole mess
 
02:39:04.610 --> 02:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
and it was victimized by the family
 
02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
courts a year ago he put a gun to his
 
02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
head and blew his head off okay that's
 
02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.590 align:start position:0%
head and blew his head off okay that's
where

02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:13.849 --> 02:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
not directly but certainly had a PL
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
played a pot
 
02:39:17.150 --> 02:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
and that kid's suicide we've got to stop
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
this we've got to put some rules not not
 
02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
rules we have to put some statue
 
02:39:23.330 --> 02:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
together and make these judges follow
 
02:39:25.070 --> 02:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
02:39:30.770 --> 02:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:43.969 --> 02:39:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:39:48.770 --> 02:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
we'll close the hearing on 1592.
 
02:39:51.230 --> 02:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll begin the hearing on our final
 
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill for the morning which is house bill
 
02:39:52.920 --> 02:40:14.630 align:start position:0%
bill for the morning which is house bill
1206.

02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:16.429 --> 02:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
and we'll call upon the prime sponsor
 
02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn to provide his
 
02:40:22.250 --> 02:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
testimony and introduce the Bill thank
 
02:40:24.349 --> 02:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman members of the
 
02:40:27.950 --> 02:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee this really is a housekeeping
 
02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:28.750 align:start position:0%
committee this really is a housekeeping
bill

02:40:28.750 --> 02:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:40:31.969 --> 02:40:31.979 align:start position:0%
and I in terms of sort of the substance
 
02:40:34.849 --> 02:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
uh and and explanation for the reasons
 
02:40:38.270 --> 02:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
of it I'm gonna I'm gonna defer to Mr
 
02:40:39.770 --> 02:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
head from the judicial branch but
 
02:40:41.690 --> 02:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
basically as you can see from the
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
language the purpose of of
 
02:40:47.929 --> 02:40:47.939 align:start position:0%
the bill is just to make sure that the
 
02:40:49.969 --> 02:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
costs for appointment of counsel and
 
02:40:52.270 --> 02:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services
 
02:40:57.410 --> 02:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
that are necessary uh for DNA testing um
 
02:41:00.110 --> 02:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
are paid for by the judicial Council as
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to coming out of the funding of
 
02:41:06.830 --> 02:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch I that's that would
 
02:41:08.270 --> 02:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
you know that would to do that would be
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
consistent with the way those things are
 
02:41:13.070 --> 02:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
handled in all other contexts and I
 
02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
think it's it's uh it's pretty important
 
02:41:16.730 --> 02:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
um that they'd be handled that way with
 
02:41:21.170 --> 02:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
respect to this legislation also and
 
02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
that's really all I have to say I'm
 
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if if uh
 
02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
Representatives have them
 
02:41:29.630 --> 02:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
any any questions for representative
 
02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:31.429 align:start position:0%
any any questions for representative
Lynn

02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
Lynn
 
02:41:32.990 --> 02:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:41:38.330 --> 02:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:44.690 --> 02:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:46.190 --> 02:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Richard head
 
02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
I'm the government Affairs coordinator
 
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch we had asked
 
02:41:54.530 --> 02:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative Lin to present this bill
 
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
because last year
 
02:41:58.670 --> 02:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 270
 
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
pretty significantly expanded the rights
 
02:42:04.250 --> 02:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
of parties who have been convicted of
 
02:42:07.309 --> 02:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
crime to to file post-conviction DNA
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
testing petitions
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
and it included a provision to
 
02:42:15.530 --> 02:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
um for Indigent parties to be to be have
 
02:42:17.650 --> 02:42:17.660 align:start position:0%
their their
 
02:42:20.770 --> 02:42:20.780 align:start position:0%
DNA petition Council funded by the state
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
normally as as representative Lin said
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
that's not done by the judicial branch
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
but without this correction that funding
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism is through the judicial branch
 
02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
because there's another statute RSA 490
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
colon 31 that says if the funding source
 
02:42:39.530 --> 02:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
is not clear the judicial branch is
 
02:42:42.889 --> 02:42:42.899 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh for payment of any
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
costs that are ordered by the court and
 
02:42:47.389 --> 02:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
since the the statute last year in house
 
02:42:48.830 --> 02:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
built or the amendment last year in
 
02:42:51.650 --> 02:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
House Bill 270 says that the court has
 
02:42:54.290 --> 02:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
to provide Indigent defense counsel or
 
02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
Indigent counsel for these post-dna
 
02:43:00.410 --> 02:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
conviction petitions that became a
 
02:43:03.170 --> 02:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
burden on on the judicial branch and and
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
really the intent is always that
 
02:43:07.849 --> 02:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
Indigent defense fees are paid through
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council so this is as a
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
practical matter simply a a cleanup that
 
02:43:16.730 --> 02:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
was missed in House Bill 270 last year
 
02:43:19.309 --> 02:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
to to ensure that the the mechanisms
 
02:43:21.469 --> 02:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
that already exist for Indigent defense
 
02:43:23.570 --> 02:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
Council fees to be paid through the
 
02:43:25.790 --> 02:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
judicial Council occur under this
 
02:43:28.849 --> 02:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
statute also judicial Council we
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
consulted them with them with this
 
02:43:32.889 --> 02:43:32.899 align:start position:0%
amendment and they also agree
 
02:43:35.090 --> 02:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
that this was the intent and you
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually see in the fiscal note from the
 
02:43:39.650 --> 02:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
judicial Council that it was their
 
02:43:42.349 --> 02:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
assumption in in providing the fiscal
 
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
note that they would be responsible
 
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
for uh for the fees
 
02:43:50.809 --> 02:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
and with that I'd be happy to take any
 
02:43:50.819 --> 02:43:52.190 align:start position:0%
and with that I'd be happy to take any
questions

02:43:52.190 --> 02:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:57.600 --> 02:43:58.570 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:43:58.570 --> 02:43:58.580 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:44:02.030 --> 02:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
oh representative D Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
02:44:05.270 --> 02:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and attorney head I have a
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
question when I reviewed
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
last night I noticed there was a range
 
02:44:15.250 --> 02:44:15.260 align:start position:0%
in the amount of money that would be
 
02:44:19.490 --> 02:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
available for the testing and I believe
 
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
it said somewhere between
 
02:44:24.410 --> 02:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
five and ten thousand dollars was it
 
02:44:25.849 --> 02:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
that's what the
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
so that that's the fiscal note from the
 
02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
judicial Council so just in terms of of
 
02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
structure to take a quick step back
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
judicial council is an executive branch
 
02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:38.050 align:start position:0%
judicial council is an executive branch
entity

02:44:38.050 --> 02:44:38.060 align:start position:0%
entity
 
02:44:42.290 --> 02:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
and they manage the the costs and fees
 
02:44:44.570 --> 02:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
of indigenous defense
 
02:44:44.580 --> 02:44:45.349 align:start position:0%
of indigenous defense
um

02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
why they put five to ten thousand
 
02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
dollars in a year I don't know that
 
02:44:50.870 --> 02:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't my fiscal note
 
02:44:53.270 --> 02:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
um that was the judicial councils I see
 
02:44:55.550 --> 02:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
um but that's just their estimate of the
 
02:44:58.190 --> 02:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
cost of of DNA testing itself which
 
02:45:01.070 --> 02:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
would if for an incident party be a be a
 
02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
cost of the state
 
02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's a wide variance it is it also you
 
02:45:08.510 --> 02:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
know from what little I know about DNA
 
02:45:10.969 --> 02:45:10.979 align:start position:0%
testing the type of DNA testing and the
 
02:45:14.090 --> 02:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
quality of the DNA impact the price
 
02:45:18.830 --> 02:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's not one one test one one
 
02:45:20.929 --> 02:45:20.939 align:start position:0%
one DNA sample they're not all the same
 
02:45:22.969 --> 02:45:22.979 align:start position:0%
okay thank you some are more complicated
 
02:45:27.170 --> 02:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
some are more I see thank you very much
 
02:45:29.150 --> 02:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:45:31.309 --> 02:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
I think I had the same concern because I
 
02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
I read that fiscal note that said it
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
would be five to ten thousand dollars
 
02:45:37.550 --> 02:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
per test
 
02:45:40.490 --> 02:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
and then the conclusion here is that
 
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
they couldn't calculate it was an
 
02:45:44.270 --> 02:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
indeterminable amount it seems like
 
02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
somebody could figure out how many tests
 
02:45:47.510 --> 02:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:45:51.230 --> 02:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're doing well the the the the flip
 
02:45:53.690 --> 02:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
side of that is the the bill last year
 
02:45:57.410 --> 02:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 270 expanded the
 
02:46:00.290 --> 02:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
right to to perform post DNA testing so
 
02:46:02.690 --> 02:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of history to fall
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
back on in order to
 
02:46:06.650 --> 02:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
the expectation is there'll be more
 
02:46:06.660 --> 02:46:08.050 align:start position:0%
the expectation is there'll be more
filings

02:46:08.050 --> 02:46:08.060 align:start position:0%
filings
 
02:46:10.490 --> 02:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
but because the bill has only recently
 
02:46:12.349 --> 02:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
gone into effect sort of calculating
 
02:46:15.410 --> 02:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
that in terms of number of cases and
 
02:46:19.130 --> 02:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
types of DNA testing is is limited I
 
02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
mean in the past we've gotten relatively
 
02:46:22.090 --> 02:46:22.100 align:start position:0%
few of these
 
02:46:24.770 --> 02:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
so the expectation is there'll be more
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
but how they how the judicial Council
 
02:46:29.330 --> 02:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
itself sort of came up with that range I
 
02:46:31.150 --> 02:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:46:33.710 --> 02:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
but I suspect it just has to do with
 
02:46:37.370 --> 02:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
with the nature of DNA testing which is
 
02:46:39.530 --> 02:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:46:43.130 --> 02:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.590 --> 02:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
02:46:50.929 --> 02:46:50.939 align:start position:0%
I have no one else who signed up in
 
02:46:52.969 --> 02:46:52.979 align:start position:0%
advance is there anyone else who would
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
like to testify on House Bill 1206
 
02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
seeing no one declare the hearing closed
 
02:47:03.170 --> 02:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1206.
 
02:47:06.050 --> 02:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
and recess for lunch we'll reconvene at
 
04:01:05.530 --> 04:01:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:09.410 --> 04:01:09.420 align:start position:0%

I just want to point out to the members
 
04:01:41.389 --> 04:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
that I put on
 
04:01:43.750 --> 04:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
on there right before on front of their
 
04:01:47.150 --> 04:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
spots uh handout so you should see that
 
04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll be referring to that in a few
 
04:01:49.800 --> 04:01:51.250 align:start position:0%
and I'll be referring to that in a few
points

04:01:51.250 --> 04:01:51.260 align:start position:0%
points
 
04:01:54.110 --> 04:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
Michelle I'm here to introduce house
 
04:01:56.030 --> 04:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
bill 1086.
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
relative to consuming of of course of
 
04:01:59.040 --> 04:02:00.110 align:start position:0%
relative to consuming of of course of
action

04:02:00.110 --> 04:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:02:02.150 --> 04:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
this bill was brought to my attention by
 
04:02:06.189 --> 04:02:06.199 align:start position:0%
my constituent Brent arborghest
 
04:02:09.769 --> 04:02:09.779 align:start position:0%
who will do a little more explanation of
 
04:02:12.229 --> 04:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
this bill than I will
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
I uh I'm an engineer and I'm not a
 
04:02:14.880 --> 04:02:16.550 align:start position:0%
I uh I'm an engineer and I'm not a
lawyer

04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
04:02:20.269 --> 04:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
but in layman's terms what this bill
 
04:02:20.279 --> 04:02:21.349 align:start position:0%
but in layman's terms what this bill
does

04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:02:24.889 --> 04:02:24.899 align:start position:0%
if you have a a wrong done to you and
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
the statute of limitations on filing a
 
04:02:29.570 --> 04:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
suit has passed
 
04:02:31.849 --> 04:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
but you discover a fraudulent
 
04:02:31.859 --> 04:02:33.530 align:start position:0%
but you discover a fraudulent
concealment

04:02:33.530 --> 04:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
concealment
 
04:02:37.370 --> 04:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
that you found later on that would want
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
you would then have reason to have cause
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
to uh to file a suit
 
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
had a
 
04:02:46.729 --> 04:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
what would happen in this bill is that
 
04:02:48.889 --> 04:02:48.899 align:start position:0%
the clock for the statute of limitations
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
would be reset
 
04:02:52.910 --> 04:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't change the statute of limitations
 
04:02:56.150 --> 04:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
to that particular type of of suit but
 
04:02:58.010 --> 04:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
it resets the clock
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh to to that to that uh
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
when they when that's consumer was
 
04:03:03.600 --> 04:03:04.550 align:start position:0%
when they when that's consumer was
discovered

04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
discovered
 
04:03:06.530 --> 04:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
a period of time the consumer occurred
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
shall not count and determining the time
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
limitation of of commencing the action
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change the statute of
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
limitation applicable for the particular
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
case type but changes when the clock
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
starts ticking
 
04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
so an example would be
 
04:03:26.269 --> 04:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
if there was such a limitations was five
 
04:03:29.330 --> 04:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
years and then there was a discovery
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
that that they found that there was
 
04:03:35.450 --> 04:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
fortunately concealment of of facts that
 
04:03:37.370 --> 04:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
and you decide you want to file a case
 
04:03:41.389 --> 04:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
that that after that two years
 
04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
the clock zero and you get five years to
 
04:03:47.570 --> 04:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
to deal with the case that you go on a
 
04:03:47.580 --> 04:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
to deal with the case that you go on a
file

04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
file
 
04:03:51.170 --> 04:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
before before filing this bill I went to
 
04:03:52.849 --> 04:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
the legislative research
 
04:03:55.010 --> 04:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
who produced a list of states
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
that had fraudulent consumer laws
 
04:04:00.889 --> 04:04:00.899 align:start position:0%
you will see 14 states have in the
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
handout that I presided 14 states that
 
04:04:06.769 --> 04:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
fraudulent concealment laws
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
and actually one of them is New
 
04:04:08.640 --> 04:04:09.710 align:start position:0%
and actually one of them is New
Hampshire

04:04:09.710 --> 04:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:04:11.450 --> 04:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
on page eight
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
if you go to page eight of what I handed
 
04:04:13.199 --> 04:04:14.510 align:start position:0%
if you go to page eight of what I handed
out

04:04:14.510 --> 04:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:04:14.520 --> 04:04:15.530 align:start position:0%
out
uh

04:04:15.530 --> 04:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:18.189 --> 04:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
but that that fraudulent concealment law
 
04:04:23.150 --> 04:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
is only for damages from construction
 
04:04:26.450 --> 04:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
not all kinds of cases just Construction
 
04:04:31.010 --> 04:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:34.429 --> 04:04:34.439 align:start position:0%
so the other of the 14 states there are
 
04:04:38.090 --> 04:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
six that have complete uh fraudulent
 
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
concealment usually the states have
 
04:04:42.050 --> 04:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
carve outs like we do
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that would be Massachusetts Vermont
 
04:04:45.650 --> 04:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Missouri and Illinois and
 
04:04:45.660 --> 04:04:46.849 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Missouri and Illinois and
Indiana

04:04:46.849 --> 04:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
Indiana
 
04:04:48.769 --> 04:04:48.779 align:start position:0%
oh and you it's they're all in the
 
04:04:50.510 --> 04:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
document here that have pretty more
 
04:04:52.130 --> 04:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
comprehensive fall deal and concealment
 
04:04:52.140 --> 04:04:54.110 align:start position:0%
comprehensive fall deal and concealment
laws

04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:04:57.170 --> 04:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
we modeled this bill against the
 
04:04:59.450 --> 04:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts statute which can be found
 
04:05:01.729 --> 04:05:01.739 align:start position:0%
on Page Six
 
04:05:04.250 --> 04:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
in in the middle of the in the middle of
 
04:05:06.410 --> 04:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
the page in the handout
 
04:05:09.969 --> 04:05:09.979 align:start position:0%
now our draft are changed fraudulent
 
04:05:13.610 --> 04:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
fraudulent con uh
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh concealment to
 
04:05:19.309 --> 04:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
purposely conceal so and I'm not being a
 
04:05:21.050 --> 04:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
lawyer I wasn't going to argue with them
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh why why we use purposely conceals
 
04:05:26.090 --> 04:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
versus fortunately conceals
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
the member members of this committee
 
04:05:32.090 --> 04:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
would know better than I why he did this
 
04:05:38.809 --> 04:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
even though in RSA 508 colon 4-b
 
04:05:40.969 --> 04:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
uh damages from construction the term
 
04:05:44.150 --> 04:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
fraudulent concealment was utilized and
 
04:05:47.689 --> 04:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
again that's in the bottom of page eight
 
04:05:51.729 --> 04:05:51.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.530 --> 04:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
you know the only concern would be are
 
04:05:56.030 --> 04:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
there going to be more cases because of
 
04:05:56.040 --> 04:05:57.530 align:start position:0%
there going to be more cases because of
this

04:05:57.530 --> 04:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:06:01.429 --> 04:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
and they they uh the Judiciary said
 
04:06:04.570 --> 04:06:04.580 align:start position:0%
there could be maybe it may
 
04:06:08.330 --> 04:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
but at the last sentence they say wow
 
04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
the total fiscal impact is
 
04:06:13.130 --> 04:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
indeterminable the judicial Brands
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate such fiscal impact would be
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
relatively minor
 
04:06:18.000 --> 04:06:19.790 align:start position:0%
relatively minor
basically

04:06:19.790 --> 04:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
which which to me means it's it's not
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
going to be that that big of a deal
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair
 
04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
I know this committee will give full
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
consideration to this the substance of
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:06:36.130 --> 04:06:36.140 align:start position:0%
I'm at ready to provide more information
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
to in any work sessions on this bill and
 
04:06:41.210 --> 04:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
assistant and with any amendments you'd
 
04:06:44.450 --> 04:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
like to make that that may be required
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
I will take questions but again the
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
gentleman behind me will probably be
 
04:06:52.309 --> 04:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
better able to answer them but I will
 
04:06:55.070 --> 04:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
again I came in this totally neutral
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
on this we all get constituent bills I
 
04:07:00.889 --> 04:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
knew nothing about any of this topic but
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know you get forced to research
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
stuff and I saw all of these states that
 
04:07:07.309 --> 04:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
have forgile consumement laws uh so I'm
 
04:07:10.189 --> 04:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
really trying to understand why we don't
 
04:07:12.110 --> 04:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and I think this is a good bill we
 
04:07:13.729 --> 04:07:13.739 align:start position:0%
modeled it you know Vermont has a pretty
 
04:07:15.530 --> 04:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
comprehensive one our neighbors and and
 
04:07:18.530 --> 04:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as well uh so hopefully
 
04:07:19.610 --> 04:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
you give this one this bill
 
04:07:22.490 --> 04:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you
 
04:07:23.809 --> 04:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
04:07:27.530 --> 04:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:28.910 --> 04:07:28.920 align:start position:0%

04:07:51.550 --> 04:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:54.530 --> 04:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me here today I
 
04:07:56.929 --> 04:07:56.939 align:start position:0%

04:08:00.050 --> 04:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
some good that I think is good
 
04:08:00.060 --> 04:08:01.010 align:start position:0%
some good that I think is good
um

04:08:01.010 --> 04:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
would you like me to just start why I so
 
04:08:08.750 --> 04:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I I was a victim of a fraud
 
04:08:11.330 --> 04:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh by attorneys
 
04:08:11.340 --> 04:08:12.170 align:start position:0%
uh by attorneys
um

04:08:12.170 --> 04:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
and I someone I trusted and I had no
 
04:08:15.840 --> 04:08:17.030 align:start position:0%
and I someone I trusted and I had no
idea

04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
that I was a victim they basically they
 
04:08:23.090 --> 04:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
used a federal court system
 
04:08:25.550 --> 04:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
to set me up
 
04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
um they weren't really my Advocates they
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
were setting me up because I had worked
 
04:08:30.889 --> 04:08:30.899 align:start position:0%
for a pharmaceutical industry company
 
04:08:30.899 --> 04:08:32.410 align:start position:0%
for a pharmaceutical industry company
that

04:08:32.410 --> 04:08:32.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
was basically
 
04:08:38.689 --> 04:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
uh recruiting employees with saying that
 
04:08:40.189 --> 04:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
a job was exempt when it really wasn't
 
04:08:40.199 --> 04:08:41.269 align:start position:0%
a job was exempt when it really wasn't
exempt

04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
and when I complained about it
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
they were very mean to me
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
they have to bake do a lot of false
 
04:08:51.889 --> 04:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
accusations so they can get you out of
 
04:08:51.899 --> 04:08:52.969 align:start position:0%
accusations so they can get you out of
there

04:08:52.969 --> 04:08:52.979 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:08:54.650 --> 04:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
for a reason that will you know
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
pre-textual they'll stand up in court
 
04:08:58.849 --> 04:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
and then after that
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
um or before I was terminated I filed a
 
04:09:02.530 --> 04:09:02.540 align:start position:0%
complaint with the
 
04:09:04.610 --> 04:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor wage and hour
 
04:09:04.620 --> 04:09:05.809 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor wage and hour
division

04:09:05.809 --> 04:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:09:08.630 --> 04:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to take this down and um
 
04:09:11.530 --> 04:09:11.540 align:start position:0%
the mass Attorney General's office
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
and when it started looking like
 
04:09:17.090 --> 04:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
basically they found over 150
 
04:09:18.889 --> 04:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
misclassified employees that were owed
 
04:09:20.750 --> 04:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars these
 
04:09:22.370 --> 04:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
are young professionals
 
04:09:25.010 --> 04:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh that their college degree was being
 
04:09:27.290 --> 04:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
used against them
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
there was a fight against a union that
 
04:09:31.130 --> 04:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
basically they were they were caught in
 
04:09:33.410 --> 04:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
the middle of because when you classify
 
04:09:36.410 --> 04:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
someone as a professional it affects
 
04:09:39.050 --> 04:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
whether or not they can engage in
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
concerted activity but they were also
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
getting thousands of hours a week for
 
04:09:45.410 --> 04:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
overtime for free from these
 
04:09:45.420 --> 04:09:46.490 align:start position:0%
overtime for free from these
um

04:09:46.490 --> 04:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:46.500 --> 04:09:47.929 align:start position:0%
um
employees

04:09:47.929 --> 04:09:47.939 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:09:52.370 --> 04:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
well the attorneys that basically told
 
04:09:53.929 --> 04:09:53.939 align:start position:0%
me they were going to represent me they
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
were trying to hide this
 
04:09:55.680 --> 04:09:56.389 align:start position:0%
were trying to hide this
um

04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:58.849 --> 04:09:58.859 align:start position:0%
and so they were trying to stop me from
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
being able to cooperate with uh the
 
04:10:03.650 --> 04:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and they would uh
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
given the Department of Labor the
 
04:10:08.929 --> 04:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
impression that I was being represented
 
04:10:10.610 --> 04:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
um they end up filing a lawsuit on my
 
04:10:13.130 --> 04:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
behalf without me knowing without me
 
04:10:15.530 --> 04:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
even telling them that they could
 
04:10:18.650 --> 04:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
and then after a month went by they
 
04:10:20.269 --> 04:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
brought me in and showed me the
 
04:10:22.370 --> 04:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
complaint that was filed on my behalf by
 
04:10:25.550 --> 04:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
people I never met okay and I was talked
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
into agreeing with it at that point
 
04:10:29.929 --> 04:10:29.939 align:start position:0%
because they presented me with a
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
contract that said they were going to
 
04:10:32.510 --> 04:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
represent me
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
and it was uh people uh that are very
 
04:10:38.689 --> 04:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
highly esteemed in the state
 
04:10:41.870 --> 04:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
and I went with it
 
04:10:41.880 --> 04:10:42.469 align:start position:0%
and I went with it
um

04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:45.769 --> 04:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
well it turned out so I so for 12 years
 
04:10:49.550 --> 04:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
or 13 years I went around thinking
 
04:10:51.889 --> 04:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
I end up getting talked into just
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
settling uh and basically there's a
 
04:10:56.990 --> 04:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
court record on Pacer which I didn't
 
04:11:00.050 --> 04:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
know about that's basically
 
04:11:02.269 --> 04:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
um says a lot of bad things about me
 
04:11:03.769 --> 04:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
that they were allowed to say because
 
04:11:06.530 --> 04:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
they were told don't worry about it you
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
know we're not gonna
 
04:11:10.250 --> 04:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
say anything back we're going to make
 
04:11:12.170 --> 04:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
sure there's no evidence available
 
04:11:14.330 --> 04:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're going to break all the
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
federal rules of civil procedure the
 
04:11:18.290 --> 04:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
local rules things that are supposed to
 
04:11:18.300 --> 04:11:19.550 align:start position:0%
local rules things that are supposed to
protect

04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
protect
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know a plaintiff like me with no
 
04:11:24.769 --> 04:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
money this company spent four billion
 
04:11:27.710 --> 04:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
dollars in legal costs in the year that
 
04:11:29.689 --> 04:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
I uh that this happened
 
04:11:33.610 --> 04:11:33.620 align:start position:0%
they also that same year was engaged in
 
04:11:36.490 --> 04:11:36.500 align:start position:0%
defrauding the federal government
 
04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers out of almost one billion
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
dollars that they've recently settled uh
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
in 2018 but the uh the Acts were were
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
taking place while I was there at this
 
04:11:49.680 --> 04:11:50.630 align:start position:0%
taking place while I was there at this
company

04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:11:53.570 --> 04:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
so uh when I found this out I have sir
 
04:11:56.450 --> 04:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
tips surreptitiously found this out in
 
04:11:56.460 --> 04:11:58.670 align:start position:0%
tips surreptitiously found this out in
2018.

04:11:58.670 --> 04:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
04:11:58.680 --> 04:11:59.650 align:start position:0%
2018.
um

04:11:59.650 --> 04:11:59.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:02.330 --> 04:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
because I asked for my files
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
and that's when the attorney told me he
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
really wasn't representing me he was
 
04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
just a local Council and that this other
 
04:12:10.849 --> 04:12:10.859 align:start position:0%
guy was the lead attorney but the other
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
guy wasn't even licensed to practice law
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
in in Massachusetts never made an
 
04:12:17.210 --> 04:12:17.220 align:start position:0%
appearance was not an attorney record
 
04:12:19.370 --> 04:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh and so I started looking into it and
 
04:12:20.929 --> 04:12:20.939 align:start position:0%
I basically figured out what happened so
 
04:12:22.250 --> 04:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
I filed a grievance against this
 
04:12:26.689 --> 04:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
attorney okay and the with the new New
 
04:12:27.650 --> 04:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court attorney
 
04:12:30.769 --> 04:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
discipline committee and
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
um they have a similar we have what's
 
04:12:35.689 --> 04:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
called a common law Discovery Rule and
 
04:12:38.410 --> 04:12:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:40.849 --> 04:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of people a lot of times people
 
04:12:43.550 --> 04:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
explain it with the doc with if a doctor
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
left a sponge or something as I think a
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
case in New Hampshire but if you don't
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
know that you were injured
 
04:12:53.469 --> 04:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
uh and you know some time goes by
 
04:12:56.650 --> 04:12:56.660 align:start position:0%
then the statute of limitations is told
 
04:13:00.830 --> 04:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
however there is a caveat it says if you
 
04:13:02.929 --> 04:13:02.939 align:start position:0%
it says that you need to be reasonably
 
04:13:02.939 --> 04:13:04.790 align:start position:0%
it says that you need to be reasonably
diligent

04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
diligent
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
so if you don't know uh what happened to
 
04:13:07.680 --> 04:13:09.290 align:start position:0%
so if you don't know uh what happened to
you

04:13:09.290 --> 04:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
um then it becomes a subjective somebody
 
04:13:13.010 --> 04:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
makes a decision well was he reasonably
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
diligent to find out that something
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
happened to him
 
04:13:16.560 --> 04:13:18.530 align:start position:0%
happened to him
so

04:13:18.530 --> 04:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:18.540 --> 04:13:19.729 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:13:19.729 --> 04:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:23.929 --> 04:13:23.939 align:start position:0%
when I filed agreements which was
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
um they wrote back and said you know
 
04:13:28.550 --> 04:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's the same same statute of
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
limitations same Discovery rule same
 
04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
warning everything they told me that I
 
04:13:34.370 --> 04:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
should have known about this already
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
because there were documents on Pacer
 
04:13:41.150 --> 04:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
this whole time that I uh could have
 
04:13:44.809 --> 04:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
accessed and Pacer is basically a
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
professional legal research
 
04:13:48.239 --> 04:13:49.670 align:start position:0%
professional legal research
um

04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:54.349 --> 04:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
subscription based it's fee based so
 
04:13:56.689 --> 04:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
um I didn't know it existed
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
and not not only that but the contract I
 
04:14:02.090 --> 04:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
had with them I was obligated to pay
 
04:14:05.210 --> 04:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
them overhead for this for this fee
 
04:14:05.220 --> 04:14:06.229 align:start position:0%
them overhead for this for this fee
service

04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:14:07.969 --> 04:14:07.979 align:start position:0%
and they're supposed to show me these
 
04:14:09.650 --> 04:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
these papers when they file papers
 
04:14:11.570 --> 04:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to show them to me this
 
04:14:14.269 --> 04:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
was you know in my opinion I mean
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
um they get a free copy as my attorney
 
04:14:19.969 --> 04:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
but they hid all this from me
 
04:14:22.429 --> 04:14:22.439 align:start position:0%
so the point is that
 
04:14:24.170 --> 04:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
04:14:26.389 --> 04:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not someone was reasonably
 
04:14:29.090 --> 04:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
diligent is kind of subjective
 
04:14:29.100 --> 04:14:30.710 align:start position:0%
diligent is kind of subjective
and

04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:32.750 --> 04:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
um it didn't work in my case because
 
04:14:34.910 --> 04:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
there's no way I would I could have
 
04:14:37.729 --> 04:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
known or should have known I didn't know
 
04:14:41.570 --> 04:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
and I was I would diligently pursued
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
this up until a certain point you get
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
mentally exhausted after about the 15th
 
04:14:47.450 --> 04:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
person that you have to
 
04:14:50.030 --> 04:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
try to convince uh that what they're
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
doing is very wrong
 
04:14:51.840 --> 04:14:53.090 align:start position:0%
doing is very wrong
so

04:14:53.090 --> 04:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:56.090 --> 04:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
what this law will do and it's like in
 
04:14:58.429 --> 04:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's in Connecticut and
 
04:14:58.439 --> 04:14:59.510 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's in Connecticut and
Vermont

04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
04:15:03.530 --> 04:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
if you can show that the person took
 
04:15:05.450 --> 04:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
steps to actively fraudulently conceal
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
the action and you can show that in
 
04:15:09.110 --> 04:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
court and you can meet that
 
04:15:09.120 --> 04:15:09.710 align:start position:0%
court and you can meet that
um

04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:13.130 --> 04:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
standard of of evidence
 
04:15:15.530 --> 04:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
then you don't have to show that you
 
04:15:17.570 --> 04:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
were reasonably diligent you don't have
 
04:15:19.550 --> 04:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
to prove that subjective
 
04:15:19.560 --> 04:15:20.269 align:start position:0%
to prove that subjective
um

04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know measure you only have to
 
04:15:25.370 --> 04:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
you know they have to the only issue is
 
04:15:27.530 --> 04:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
whether you knew or not
 
04:15:32.570 --> 04:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
so uh in my case you know if if in other
 
04:15:34.189 --> 04:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
words basically it comes down to public
 
04:15:34.199 --> 04:15:35.450 align:start position:0%
words basically it comes down to public
interest

04:15:35.450 --> 04:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
do we want people who can be shown to
 
04:15:40.010 --> 04:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
have committed fraudulent acts to
 
04:15:43.010 --> 04:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
conceal uh something to have peace of
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
mind through the statute of limitations
 
04:15:50.030 --> 04:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
um or do we want a person who was a
 
04:15:52.910 --> 04:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
victim of fraud and fraudulent
 
04:15:56.450 --> 04:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
concealment to have Justice
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
um under the current
 
04:16:00.769 --> 04:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
common law Discovery rule which actually
 
04:16:03.710 --> 04:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
the court passed the court
 
04:16:06.830 --> 04:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
um made up like in the 70s and then the
 
04:16:08.689 --> 04:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
and then the legislature
 
04:16:11.150 --> 04:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
passed the law that would that was
 
04:16:12.830 --> 04:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
basically what the court said
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
and if you look
 
04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
like besides these so it's does that do
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
you understand the difference between
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
if someone's defrauded and a person
 
04:16:26.150 --> 04:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
fraudulently could seals something
 
04:16:29.150 --> 04:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
and people are very smart
 
04:16:31.010 --> 04:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
um and it's an important thing they
 
04:16:32.450 --> 04:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
didn't want a class action there was a
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
lot of powerful people that did not want
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
me to know this they had a lot of
 
04:16:36.239 --> 04:16:38.510 align:start position:0%
me to know this they had a lot of
cooperation

04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
04:16:38.520 --> 04:16:39.830 align:start position:0%
cooperation
um

04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:41.809 --> 04:16:41.819 align:start position:0%
now it's going to go to somebody to
 
04:16:43.490 --> 04:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
subjectively say was he reasonably
 
04:16:43.500 --> 04:16:44.689 align:start position:0%
subjectively say was he reasonably
diligent

04:16:44.689 --> 04:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
diligent
 
04:16:47.150 --> 04:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
and and whether or not I get Justice
 
04:16:50.150 --> 04:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
depends on their subjective
 
04:16:50.160 --> 04:16:51.050 align:start position:0%
depends on their subjective
um

04:16:51.050 --> 04:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
thought about was he diligent could he
 
04:16:55.370 --> 04:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
like Pace her I don't know what Pacer is
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think most people know what
 
04:16:59.689 --> 04:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
Pacer is and even and I got a pace her
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
account actually after I learned what it
 
04:17:01.319 --> 04:17:02.330 align:start position:0%
account actually after I learned what it
was

04:17:02.330 --> 04:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:17:05.210 --> 04:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
and within the first month I racked up a
 
04:17:08.330 --> 04:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
bill of 360 dollars and I didn't even
 
04:17:11.090 --> 04:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
know it okay and I know there's some
 
04:17:13.849 --> 04:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
attorneys here that probably know what
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
but it's a fee service but the point is
 
04:17:19.250 --> 04:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
that I should
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
it was not a very good excuse to deny me
 
04:17:21.600 --> 04:17:22.849 align:start position:0%
it was not a very good excuse to deny me
Justice

04:17:22.849 --> 04:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
and that I think Society be better off
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
to prevent this from happening again to
 
04:17:32.510 --> 04:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
hold the people who engage in those
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
types of fraudulent activities
 
04:17:33.779 --> 04:17:35.269 align:start position:0%
types of fraudulent activities
accountable

04:17:35.269 --> 04:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
and that if you can prove that they if
 
04:17:39.710 --> 04:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
you could show you know it's a high it's
 
04:17:41.210 --> 04:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
a higher standard if you can show that
 
04:17:43.010 --> 04:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
they fraudulently concealed stuff with
 
04:17:45.950 --> 04:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
the purpose of keeping this of keeping
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge view that you you were harmed
 
04:17:52.610 --> 04:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
and that uh you have uh an action a
 
04:17:54.410 --> 04:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
legitimate cause of action
 
04:17:54.420 --> 04:17:56.030 align:start position:0%
legitimate cause of action
then

04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:17:56.040 --> 04:17:56.570 align:start position:0%
then
um

04:17:56.570 --> 04:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
I think that should be enough so that
 
04:18:00.830 --> 04:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have to worry about
 
04:18:03.830 --> 04:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
proving you were reasonably diligent you
 
04:18:05.330 --> 04:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
just have to prove whether you knew or
 
04:18:05.340 --> 04:18:06.050 align:start position:0%
just have to prove whether you knew or
not

04:18:06.050 --> 04:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
or that you didn't know and that's where
 
04:18:09.469 --> 04:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
the issue comes did you know or did you
 
04:18:10.670 --> 04:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
not know
 
04:18:12.650 --> 04:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
and that's the difference
 
04:18:12.660 --> 04:18:15.650 align:start position:0%
and that's the difference
so

04:18:15.650 --> 04:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.889 --> 04:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
okay any questions are there any uh
 
04:18:18.899 --> 04:18:24.290 align:start position:0%
okay any questions are there any uh
questions

04:18:24.290 --> 04:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo
 
04:18:28.969 --> 04:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
04:18:28.979 --> 04:18:30.349 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
Burgess

04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
Burgess
 
04:18:32.150 --> 04:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony I'm just
 
04:18:33.650 --> 04:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
a little bit confused
 
04:18:35.570 --> 04:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
um and it's almost like what comes first
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
you check another egg so
 
04:18:41.809 --> 04:18:41.819 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the action that the
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
company took was found to be fraudulent
 
04:18:46.849 --> 04:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:46.859 --> 04:18:48.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:51.050 --> 04:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
no because you can't even get to that
 
04:18:53.150 --> 04:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
point because of the statute of
 
04:18:55.550 --> 04:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
limitations yeah we you just need to
 
04:18:57.410 --> 04:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
speak both parties need to speak into
 
04:18:59.330 --> 04:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
the microphone
 
04:19:01.849 --> 04:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
so the company yes they did engage in
 
04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
fraud but that doesn't even get I don't
 
04:19:05.330 --> 04:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
you know the person doesn't even get to
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
show that okay and doesn't even have a
 
04:19:08.929 --> 04:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
chance to bring it because of the
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations okay
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chair do you want me to repeat my
 
04:19:13.729 --> 04:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
question that would be a good idea okay
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
my question was this sounds like what
 
04:19:18.650 --> 04:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
comes first a Chicken or the Egg and I
 
04:19:20.389 --> 04:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
asked Mr agonas
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
um what
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
I asked him if any Court had found that
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
there was a fraudulent activity
 
04:19:30.170 --> 04:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
um caused by the company
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
and that's where we left off the wage
 
04:19:34.130 --> 04:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
now it did and they adjudicated it
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
so that I mean I don't know about
 
04:19:37.729 --> 04:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
fraudulent but
 
04:19:37.739 --> 04:19:39.290 align:start position:0%
fraudulent but
but

04:19:39.290 --> 04:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
um we can't even get there if someone
 
04:19:45.650 --> 04:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
decides that I was not reasonably
 
04:19:45.660 --> 04:19:46.910 align:start position:0%
decides that I was not reasonably
diligent

04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
diligent
 
04:19:49.309 --> 04:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
even though I'm a victim of fraud I can
 
04:19:52.490 --> 04:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
show that they uh did the most the worst
 
04:19:56.330 --> 04:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
things uh to uh deception and here I did
 
04:19:58.250 --> 04:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
I walked around for 13 years of my life
 
04:20:00.050 --> 04:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
thinking I was just a belligerent jerk
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
at work for no reason because that's
 
04:20:03.290 --> 04:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
what I was told and that they had a
 
04:20:04.990 --> 04:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
right to fire me
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
and that's cruel
 
04:20:07.680 --> 04:20:08.990 align:start position:0%
and that's cruel
because

04:20:08.990 --> 04:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:20:09.000 --> 04:20:10.130 align:start position:0%
because
I

04:20:10.130 --> 04:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:20:12.530 --> 04:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh and it doesn't this doesn't
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
this doesn't have to do with
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
um lazy people or anything like that it
 
04:20:20.150 --> 04:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's not a good business model the
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
management had no incentive to
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
streamline things at work it was a bad
 
04:20:27.050 --> 04:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
it was they could just sit and say too
 
04:20:29.570 --> 04:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
bad you have to work 10 hours more for
 
04:20:29.580 --> 04:20:30.410 align:start position:0%
bad you have to work 10 hours more for
free

04:20:30.410 --> 04:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
free
 
04:20:32.090 --> 04:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
and they had and they would actually
 
04:20:34.849 --> 04:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
strategically place uh professionals
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
with non-exempt or um yeah non-exempt
 
04:20:38.520 --> 04:20:40.189 align:start position:0%
with non-exempt or um yeah non-exempt
employees

04:20:40.189 --> 04:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:20:42.050 --> 04:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
that are doing the same thing so when I
 
04:20:45.950 --> 04:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
got there I had to my basically the
 
04:20:47.929 --> 04:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
senior person in the lab that trained me
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
and gave me instructions
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh was my say my my age
 
04:20:56.269 --> 04:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
um she was not forty thousand dollars in
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
debt from going to study chemistry in
 
04:21:00.769 --> 04:21:00.779 align:start position:0%
college for four years she drove a
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
Corvette and she uh
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh got to leave work after eight hours
 
04:21:09.889 --> 04:21:09.899 align:start position:0%
every day and the people that they just
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
just decided arbitrarily were exempt
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
were were tens of thousand dollars in
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
debt from getting a college degree
 
04:21:20.210 --> 04:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
studying science and
 
04:21:23.330 --> 04:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
it it just wasn't uh you know like I
 
04:21:26.210 --> 04:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
said they found over 150 misclassified
 
04:21:26.220 --> 04:21:27.650 align:start position:0%
said they found over 150 misclassified
employees

04:21:27.650 --> 04:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
and um basically this was
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh attorneys got together to decide that
 
04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
they need to keep this covered up
 
04:21:38.450 --> 04:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:21:40.490 --> 04:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna be filing a suit in
 
04:21:42.349 --> 04:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I would have liked to file
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
it in New Hampshire but
 
04:21:46.250 --> 04:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
um we don't have the fraudulent
 
04:21:49.309 --> 04:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
concealment law so I'm not and like I
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
said I I had a this committee was
 
04:21:53.450 --> 04:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
chaired by a judge a superior court
 
04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
judge probably very respectable judge
 
04:21:59.570 --> 04:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
and the reason given like I said was
 
04:22:01.010 --> 04:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
that I was supposed to know these papers
 
04:22:02.450 --> 04:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
were on Pacer and I don't I didn't even
 
04:22:04.610 --> 04:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
know Pacer existed you know
 
04:22:04.620 --> 04:22:05.750 align:start position:0%
know Pacer existed you know
so

04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:08.330 --> 04:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
are there other questions
 
04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative wolper
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Arbor gas for taking my
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
question what I haven't heard from you
 
04:22:21.410 --> 04:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
is how this did you any damage yeah I
 
04:22:21.420 --> 04:22:22.610 align:start position:0%
is how this did you any damage yeah I
mean

04:22:22.610 --> 04:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:22:25.610 --> 04:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
let's put it this way go ahead what I've
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
heard from you is that you were involved
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
in a situation
 
04:22:32.030 --> 04:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
you went to the authorities in
 
04:22:33.610 --> 04:22:33.620 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they found the company
 
04:22:39.950 --> 04:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:42.650 --> 04:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
and now you say and there were some
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
other things that happened but I haven't
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
heard anything about how that actually
 
04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
damaged you in any way okay well when I
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
got hired at Ys which is now Pfizer I
 
04:22:53.809 --> 04:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
had to sign a release and authorize them
 
04:22:58.010 --> 04:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
to look at my civil court uh Records my
 
04:22:59.630 --> 04:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
civil core history
 
04:22:59.640 --> 04:23:01.010 align:start position:0%
civil core history
and

04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:03.889 --> 04:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
um I guarantee you if what is on if what
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
was on Pacer right now
 
04:23:09.050 --> 04:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
that I was set up to be basically
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
defamed using the federal court system
 
04:23:14.330 --> 04:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
they would not hired me and I'm a
 
04:23:16.130 --> 04:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
chemist I'm not a construct I'm not a
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
carpenter where I can go over to you
 
04:23:20.450 --> 04:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
know or a landscaper or you know
 
04:23:23.210 --> 04:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
chemists need uh they tend to work for
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
big institutions that can afford large
 
04:23:27.189 --> 04:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
pieces of equipment
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
analytical equipment that they're big
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
Industries like the Biotech Industry uh
 
04:23:35.210 --> 04:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
the job I worked before that was the
 
04:23:37.490 --> 04:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
automotive industry I ran an analytical
 
04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
lab uh that they had hundreds of
 
04:23:42.170 --> 04:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
manufacturing plants around the world so
 
04:23:44.809 --> 04:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
it's a close-knit community
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
um compared to a lot of other Industries
 
04:23:50.929 --> 04:23:50.939 align:start position:0%
and my career stopped after that and I
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of funny things that
 
04:23:54.410 --> 04:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
would happen and this company kept
 
04:23:56.150 --> 04:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
tracking me over a year after I was
 
04:23:56.160 --> 04:23:57.229 align:start position:0%
tracking me over a year after I was
there

04:23:57.229 --> 04:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:23:59.210 --> 04:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
and they would keep track of my job
 
04:24:01.130 --> 04:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
searching activities on Monster jobs and
 
04:24:03.170 --> 04:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
print out whenever I did a new resume or
 
04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
whenever I did it I have no idea why
 
04:24:08.269 --> 04:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
like I said uh they were very powerful
 
04:24:10.250 --> 04:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
people biotechnology was really pushed
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts the industry they bent
 
04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
over backwards to accommodate that
 
04:24:16.490 --> 04:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
industry and make it flourish and one of
 
04:24:18.650 --> 04:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
the things they did was uh bury this
 
04:24:20.330 --> 04:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
type of stuff and get together and bury
 
04:24:21.469 --> 04:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
this type of stuff
 
04:24:24.769 --> 04:24:24.779 align:start position:0%
so yeah okay and then
 
04:24:27.170 --> 04:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
um I mean I could go I could go on and
 
04:24:30.410 --> 04:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
on as far as the damages but it's not
 
04:24:33.650 --> 04:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
right to just use the federal court
 
04:24:36.650 --> 04:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
system to to have them publish things
 
04:24:39.650 --> 04:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
that are completely false
 
04:24:39.660 --> 04:24:40.610 align:start position:0%
that are completely false
um

04:24:40.610 --> 04:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:40.620 --> 04:24:42.170 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:24:42.170 --> 04:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:43.849 --> 04:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
you know it's a fault I mean our federal
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
court database should not be purveyors
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
of false news okay and that's exactly
 
04:24:49.630 --> 04:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
04:24:53.450 --> 04:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
it's all false stuff that they set me up
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
for I didn't have any Advocate I had
 
04:24:58.189 --> 04:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
adversaries that would set me up in
 
04:25:00.830 --> 04:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
retaliation and to to defame me and
 
04:25:03.410 --> 04:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
discredit me and to bury what they did
 
04:25:03.420 --> 04:25:04.790 align:start position:0%
discredit me and to bury what they did
wrong

04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:25:04.800 --> 04:25:05.809 align:start position:0%
wrong
um

04:25:05.809 --> 04:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:08.750 --> 04:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
and that's damaging to me and and the
 
04:25:10.610 --> 04:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
society at Large
 
04:25:14.150 --> 04:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions Mr
 
04:25:14.160 --> 04:25:17.090 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions Mr
arborghast

04:25:17.090 --> 04:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:21.530 --> 04:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
you need to turn the mic on no sorry one
 
04:25:24.359 --> 04:25:25.070 align:start position:0%
you need to turn the mic on no sorry one
question

04:25:25.070 --> 04:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:25:26.570 --> 04:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
um are there Federal contracts with that
 
04:25:29.150 --> 04:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
company that you work for yeah Pfizer is
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
that why you're
 
04:25:32.929 --> 04:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
able to file in two jurisdictions no
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's because all the stuff happened in
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but because you know it
 
04:25:38.990 --> 04:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
was it was a close uh call for me but
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
they they do business in New Hampshire
 
04:25:42.530 --> 04:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
they recruited me when I was in New
 
04:25:44.450 --> 04:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my attorneys are from New
 
04:25:45.950 --> 04:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a lot of the employees
 
04:25:47.809 --> 04:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
involved and it basically was a
 
04:25:49.370 --> 04:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
racketeering Enterprise is what it was
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
they they hijacked the human resources
 
04:25:55.610 --> 04:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
department and but they were from New
 
04:25:57.769 --> 04:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I think New Hampshire could
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
have had uh jurisdiction over the over
 
04:26:01.130 --> 04:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
the issues
 
04:26:03.110 --> 04:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
um and I would rather file in New
 
04:26:05.929 --> 04:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but like I said I'm gonna have
 
04:26:07.550 --> 04:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
to prove subjectively that I was
 
04:26:10.189 --> 04:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
reasonably diligent
 
04:26:11.570 --> 04:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
um I I won't have to do that
 
04:26:13.790 --> 04:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Massachusetts once I show
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
that these people fraudulently concealed
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
these things from me
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
then the only issue is whether I knew or
 
04:26:19.680 --> 04:26:20.750 align:start position:0%
then the only issue is whether I knew or
not

04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to be able to
 
04:26:25.010 --> 04:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
prove I knew because I didn't know
 
04:26:25.020 --> 04:26:26.450 align:start position:0%
prove I knew because I didn't know
so

04:26:26.450 --> 04:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:26.460 --> 04:26:28.550 align:start position:0%
so
okay

04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:26:33.110 --> 04:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
04:26:34.370 --> 04:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
today thank you for having me I
 
04:26:36.050 --> 04:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
04:26:37.849 --> 04:26:37.859 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
04:26:44.450 --> 04:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.130 --> 04:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
seeing no one
 
04:26:48.290 --> 04:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
the hearing on
 
04:26:51.229 --> 04:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1086 is closed
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
and we will take a very brief three and
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
a half minute recess until we call our
 
04:27:21.649 --> 04:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:21.659 --> 04:27:35.809 align:start position:0%
 
questions

04:27:35.809 --> 04:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:37.610 --> 04:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
representative Smith have you filled out
 
04:27:55.610 --> 04:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:55.620 --> 04:30:49.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:30:49.849 --> 04:30:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.859 --> 04:30:56.689 align:start position:0%
 
I'm

04:30:56.689 --> 04:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.699 --> 04:31:04.969 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:31:04.969 --> 04:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:08.090 --> 04:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
it being 1 30.
 
04:31:09.830 --> 04:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
we'll call the house Judiciary Committee
 
04:31:13.429 --> 04:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:13.439 --> 04:31:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:18.010 --> 04:31:18.020 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of hearing House Bill
 
04:31:20.510 --> 04:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
1325 relative to the release of
 
04:31:22.729 --> 04:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
confidential confidential records and a
 
04:31:24.889 --> 04:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
person appointed a guardian
 
04:31:27.170 --> 04:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
and will call upon the primary sponsor
 
04:31:29.210 --> 04:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
04:31:31.849 --> 04:31:31.859 align:start position:0%
to provide his testimony and introduce
 
04:31:36.649 --> 04:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:39.950 --> 04:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman uh
 
04:31:41.570 --> 04:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
looking around I see a number of
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
familiar faces or part of familiar faces
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
anyway uh and some others that I don't
 
04:31:50.090 --> 04:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
know so well but I'm pleased to be here
 
04:31:51.769 --> 04:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
with you today and it's a rare
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
occurrence that I'm in front of
 
04:31:57.889 --> 04:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
Judiciary uh but uh this is a bill that
 
04:32:00.170 --> 04:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing I don't profess any
 
04:32:03.649 --> 04:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
particular expertise in this area but
 
04:32:06.290 --> 04:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'm doing so on behalf of
 
04:32:09.649 --> 04:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
um a sort of constituent of mine she
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't she lives in Northern Stratford
 
04:32:14.090 --> 04:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
County and I'm the delegation chair so I
 
04:32:16.910 --> 04:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
feel like I'm one of her uh one of her
 
04:32:19.309 --> 04:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
Representatives even though she lives up
 
04:32:20.830 --> 04:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
in Milton I believe
 
04:32:24.349 --> 04:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
but in any case she is herself a
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
guardian of an individual and she's a
 
04:32:29.570 --> 04:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
very dedicated person with regard to
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
people who have mental health issues and
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
are in a circumstance especially whether
 
04:32:37.490 --> 04:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
a number of them that I worked with her
 
04:32:40.090 --> 04:32:40.100 align:start position:0%
on over the years have been
 
04:32:44.809 --> 04:32:44.819 align:start position:0%
held at the secure psychiatric unit and
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's become one of my uh
 
04:32:51.309 --> 04:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
projects to try to get the spew out of
 
04:32:54.530 --> 04:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
the state prison and and in a better
 
04:32:56.929 --> 04:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
circumstance but in the course of my
 
04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
interaction with Mrs Duryea and perhaps
 
04:33:02.830 --> 04:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
some some of you know her Wanda durye
 
04:33:05.949 --> 04:33:05.959 align:start position:0%
she brought this matter to my attention
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to be pretty brief in in
 
04:33:12.650 --> 04:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
my testimony on the bill because you see
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
how a very simple it is and very brief
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
and not having any particular expertise
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
I I don't think I can answer any
 
04:33:24.529 --> 04:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
questions but fortunately attorney Kerry
 
04:33:29.150 --> 04:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
Tasker is with me today and this is an
 
04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
area of some expertise on her part and
 
04:33:35.090 --> 04:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
familiarity so I will I will turn it
 
04:33:37.310 --> 04:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
over to her to deal with the issue
 
04:33:37.320 --> 04:33:38.349 align:start position:0%
over to her to deal with the issue
itself

04:33:38.349 --> 04:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
itself
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
because I do recognize from my
 
04:33:45.529 --> 04:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
discussions with Mrs Durie that that
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
this is an issue which I recognize even
 
04:33:53.449 --> 04:33:53.459 align:start position:0%
as a Layman as one which a person who
 
04:33:55.609 --> 04:33:55.619 align:start position:0%
has mental health issues can get
 
04:33:58.490 --> 04:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
themselves into a a pretty bad situation
 
04:34:00.189 --> 04:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
04:34:03.369 --> 04:34:03.379 align:start position:0%
we all read about I think Britney Spears
 
04:34:06.051 --> 04:34:06.061 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how closely the cases
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
match themselves match each other but it
 
04:34:12.410 --> 04:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
certainly is the case that that if you
 
04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
have mental health issues
 
04:34:18.650 --> 04:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
and uh and and you've been put into a
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
guardianship that you've kind of lost a
 
04:34:23.810 --> 04:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
lot of control of your life so with that
 
04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
I've already already Pat you have the
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
bill of course and I've already passed
 
04:34:32.529 --> 04:34:32.539 align:start position:0%
out the written comments of Mrs Durie
 
04:34:37.730 --> 04:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
and we we have a potential of additional
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment which the committee may want
 
04:34:43.730 --> 04:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
to be informed about uh and and have
 
04:34:46.910 --> 04:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
access to uh once attorney Tasker has
 
04:34:49.010 --> 04:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
finished her remarks so with that I'll
 
04:34:50.410 --> 04:34:50.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your attention
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh and turn it over to attorney Tasker
 
04:34:55.910 --> 04:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
04:34:59.689 --> 04:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:01.369 --> 04:35:01.379 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
04:35:05.929 --> 04:35:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:08.689 --> 04:35:08.699 align:start position:0%
a question I'm confused I don't really
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
understand what it is you're trying to
 
04:35:13.970 --> 04:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
do I just had another a law put into
 
04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
effect on supported decision making
 
04:35:19.010 --> 04:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
where a person who has guardianship
 
04:35:21.769 --> 04:35:21.779 align:start position:0%
would be able to change and get some of
 
04:35:21.779 --> 04:35:23.330 align:start position:0%
would be able to change and get some of
their

04:35:23.330 --> 04:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:35:26.090 --> 04:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
life back and make their choices I I'm
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
really I'm sorry Peter I'm confused as
 
04:35:30.051 --> 04:35:30.061 align:start position:0%
to what it is you're trying to do here
 
04:35:34.250 --> 04:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
well as you see online six seven and
 
04:35:34.260 --> 04:35:35.410 align:start position:0%
well as you see online six seven and
eight

04:35:35.410 --> 04:35:35.420 align:start position:0%
eight
 
04:35:39.289 --> 04:35:39.299 align:start position:0%
it's a situation where in some cases the
 
04:35:41.449 --> 04:35:41.459 align:start position:0%
guardian has control of the person's
 
04:35:45.529 --> 04:35:45.539 align:start position:0%
confidential records and the person may
 
04:35:47.810 --> 04:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
have no no longer have access to those
 
04:35:51.849 --> 04:35:51.859 align:start position:0%
records and this would uh this would uh
 
04:35:55.250 --> 04:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
permit them as it says to have access or
 
04:35:56.810 --> 04:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
to Grant release of his or her
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
confidential records and papers
 
04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
including medical records so in many
 
04:36:04.490 --> 04:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
cases I think the guardian judge Mr
 
04:36:07.551 --> 04:36:07.561 align:start position:0%
chair uh you undoubtedly have a lot of
 
04:36:10.670 --> 04:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
expertise in this area and that's the
 
04:36:13.970 --> 04:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
purpose of it the um the potential
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
additional Amendment which we have
 
04:36:21.529 --> 04:36:21.539 align:start position:0%
copies of here maybe a helpful they have
 
04:36:23.449 --> 04:36:23.459 align:start position:0%
been provided to me by Michael skibby
 
04:36:25.730 --> 04:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sure many of you know of him or know
 
04:36:28.609 --> 04:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
him uh and we can pass that out if if
 
04:36:31.490 --> 04:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
after attorney Tasker has made her
 
04:36:34.131 --> 04:36:34.141 align:start position:0%
remarks that uh you if you want to hear
 
04:36:36.051 --> 04:36:36.061 align:start position:0%
that I'll be happy to pass them out as
 
04:36:40.849 --> 04:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:44.209 --> 04:36:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.410 --> 04:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:36:50.090 --> 04:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
and you're more than welcome the next
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:14.330 --> 04:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think anybody would object if
 
04:37:23.449 --> 04:37:23.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:30.949 --> 04:37:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.051 --> 04:37:33.061 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you
 
04:37:35.330 --> 04:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
um again I'm Carrie Tasker I'm an
 
04:37:37.310 --> 04:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
attorney here in Concord with a law firm
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
Laboe and Tasker I have been practicing
 
04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
in the area
 
04:37:45.709 --> 04:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
of probate law guardianships elder law
 
04:37:48.830 --> 04:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
for approximately 17 years I routinely
 
04:37:50.631 --> 04:37:50.641 align:start position:0%
appear before the Circuit Court in
 
04:37:52.849 --> 04:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
dealing with guardianship matters
 
04:37:54.970 --> 04:37:54.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'm representing the guardian
 
04:37:57.769 --> 04:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'm representing a petitioner
 
04:37:59.330 --> 04:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
who is seeking to have a guardianship
 
04:38:02.029 --> 04:38:02.039 align:start position:0%
imposed and other times I'm representing
 
04:38:04.490 --> 04:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
the ward the person who actually is
 
04:38:06.590 --> 04:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
under the guardianship the person who
 
04:38:08.510 --> 04:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
needs assistance
 
04:38:08.520 --> 04:38:09.170 align:start position:0%
needs assistance
um

04:38:09.170 --> 04:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
so in my experience really with working
 
04:38:14.330 --> 04:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
with the wards themselves the ones who
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
need the guardianship it has really come
 
04:38:19.131 --> 04:38:19.141 align:start position:0%
to light over the years that these
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
individuals don't have access to their
 
04:38:23.470 --> 04:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
own personal records
 
04:38:27.170 --> 04:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
generally speaking when a guardianship
 
04:38:30.170 --> 04:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
is established there is a petition and I
 
04:38:33.170 --> 04:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
have a copy um that I think can be
 
04:38:35.929 --> 04:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
passed out but there is a petition where
 
04:38:38.810 --> 04:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
the petitioner oftentimes a layperson
 
04:38:40.970 --> 04:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
will check off all of the things that
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
they believe the board the proposed Ward
 
04:38:47.150 --> 04:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
cannot handle for him or herself and on
 
04:38:49.609 --> 04:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
there is a list of things that has to do
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
with granting access
 
04:38:55.010 --> 04:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
to confidential
 
04:38:57.070 --> 04:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
medical Financial
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
documentation and allowing the ward
 
04:39:02.810 --> 04:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
himself to have access to that to that
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
documentation the paragraph you would
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
see when when you read it is a little
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
convoluted it simultaneously gives the
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
guardian the authority to access the
 
04:39:20.051 --> 04:39:20.061 align:start position:0%
erect the records while at the same time
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
revoking that Authority by of the ward
 
04:39:25.789 --> 04:39:25.799 align:start position:0%
so the ward can no longer access or her
 
04:39:28.310 --> 04:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
records I don't think that that is
 
04:39:30.670 --> 04:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily by Design
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
I think it's merely
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
just how things have evolved over the
 
04:39:39.470 --> 04:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
years in the court system by by use of
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
these forms and what ends up happening
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
is that majority of the time a ward
 
04:39:48.050 --> 04:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
needs somebody to make his or her own
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
medical decisions and sometimes
 
04:39:52.130 --> 04:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
financial decisions and I think that
 
04:39:54.288 --> 04:39:54.298 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate in many cases however
 
04:39:58.010 --> 04:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a reason why the
 
04:40:01.730 --> 04:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
person the ward is unable or should not
 
04:40:05.050 --> 04:40:05.060 align:start position:0%
access their own records
 
04:40:08.208 --> 04:40:08.218 align:start position:0%
I have a actually a case that just
 
04:40:11.270 --> 04:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
terminated by a a case where the woman
 
04:40:11.280 --> 04:40:14.150 align:start position:0%
terminated by a a case where the woman
was

04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:40:16.130 --> 04:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
certainly needed a guardianship when it
 
04:40:18.410 --> 04:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
was established and over many many
 
04:40:20.650 --> 04:40:20.660 align:start position:0%
months almost a year
 
04:40:24.170 --> 04:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
she really came out of the
 
04:40:27.050 --> 04:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
um the illness that was causing her her
 
04:40:27.060 --> 04:40:28.368 align:start position:0%
um the illness that was causing her her
dementia

04:40:28.368 --> 04:40:28.378 align:start position:0%
dementia
 
04:40:28.378 --> 04:40:29.090 align:start position:0%
dementia
um

04:40:29.090 --> 04:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:32.090 --> 04:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
and having some cognitive issues and she
 
04:40:33.890 --> 04:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to have access to all of the
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
things that were that were happening to
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
her her medical records she didn't
 
04:40:39.948 --> 04:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
understand what the doctors were saying
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
she was denied access to the medical
 
04:40:43.930 --> 04:40:43.940 align:start position:0%
records routinely
 
04:40:46.430 --> 04:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
she ended up having
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the nurses felt
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
that it was inappropriate and they would
 
04:40:54.230 --> 04:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
sort of give her copies or leave her
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
copies maybe when they shouldn't have
 
04:40:58.970 --> 04:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
but it was very difficult process for
 
04:41:01.130 --> 04:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
her to get a copy of the medical records
 
04:41:03.170 --> 04:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
and the only way we were eventually able
 
04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
to get copies of the medical records was
 
04:41:08.530 --> 04:41:08.540 align:start position:0%
um by getting an order from the court
 
04:41:12.650 --> 04:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
the guardian in that particular case
 
04:41:15.770 --> 04:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know if she didn't want to
 
04:41:18.288 --> 04:41:18.298 align:start position:0%
comply or or didn't want to release the
 
04:41:21.288 --> 04:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
records I think it was more of she
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have have time it was a
 
04:41:25.970 --> 04:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
Professional Guardian who had more than
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
30 Wards under her care and really was
 
04:41:28.798 --> 04:41:30.128 align:start position:0%
30 Wards under her care and really was
not

04:41:30.128 --> 04:41:30.138 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:41:33.770 --> 04:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
she was busy to be perfectly honest and
 
04:41:35.690 --> 04:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
the records were very important to my
 
04:41:37.788 --> 04:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
clients and maybe not as important to
 
04:41:39.970 --> 04:41:39.980 align:start position:0%
the guardian herself
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
so why I'm here is I'm here to say that
 
04:41:48.288 --> 04:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
when a guardian is a guardianship is
 
04:41:50.930 --> 04:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
implemented that there needs to be a
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
specific finding that there is a reason
 
04:41:58.430 --> 04:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
to take away a legal right of this
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
person that he or she cannot access his
 
04:42:04.128 --> 04:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
or her own Financial medical whatever
 
04:42:06.788 --> 04:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
personal records They are
 
04:42:10.270 --> 04:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
rather than it be almost a
 
04:42:13.730 --> 04:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
blanket decision that is made
 
04:42:13.740 --> 04:42:14.390 align:start position:0%
blanket decision that is made
um

04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:16.368 --> 04:42:16.378 align:start position:0%
because of what is written in the
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
guardianship petition and what is
 
04:42:20.150 --> 04:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
written in the form order that is issued
 
04:42:21.890 --> 04:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
by the court
 
04:42:21.900 --> 04:42:22.850 align:start position:0%
by the court
um

04:42:22.850 --> 04:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
I think that there are instances where
 
04:42:28.128 --> 04:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
perhaps the the ward should not have
 
04:42:30.170 --> 04:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
access to their to his or her own
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
Financial or or medical records but I
 
04:42:35.090 --> 04:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
believe there needs to be an actual
 
04:42:38.270 --> 04:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
finding of that by the court before that
 
04:42:41.390 --> 04:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
is issued the purpose of the
 
04:42:41.400 --> 04:42:42.830 align:start position:0%
is issued the purpose of the
guardianship

04:42:42.830 --> 04:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
guardianship
 
04:42:42.840 --> 04:42:43.490 align:start position:0%
guardianship
um

04:42:43.490 --> 04:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:45.890 --> 04:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be the least restrictive
 
04:42:49.730 --> 04:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
option for a person to have assistance
 
04:42:51.410 --> 04:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
in managing his or her own personal
 
04:42:53.868 --> 04:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
affairs to the extent that he or she
 
04:42:56.690 --> 04:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
cannot manage them themselves so if he
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
or she does have somebody making medical
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
decisions or making financial decisions
 
04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
they should be able to contribute the
 
04:43:07.850 --> 04:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
ward should be able to contribute to the
 
04:43:10.010 --> 04:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
decisions that are being made and should
 
04:43:13.010 --> 04:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
offer opinions about their own their own
 
04:43:16.128 --> 04:43:16.138 align:start position:0%
lives and this unfortunately the way
 
04:43:19.368 --> 04:43:19.378 align:start position:0%
that this the the law reads right now
 
04:43:19.378 --> 04:43:22.030 align:start position:0%
that this the the law reads right now
their

04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:43:25.128 --> 04:43:25.138 align:start position:0%
oftentimes automatically prevented from
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
having access to their own records
 
04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
and so that is that is the reason why
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
I'm here today so that I can ensure that
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:43:35.040 --> 04:43:36.368 align:start position:0%
it is
carefully

04:43:36.368 --> 04:43:36.378 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
decided when to remove an individual's
 
04:43:41.690 --> 04:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
rights to his or her own personal
 
04:43:46.730 --> 04:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:54.350 --> 04:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia
 
04:43:55.788 --> 04:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:43:57.170 --> 04:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I think you're right this
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph is terribly tortured uh
 
04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
should it not be Rewritten in a more
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
simple form
 
04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
and and that might be might be true as
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
um you just get that in front of me
 
04:44:17.280 --> 04:44:18.110 align:start position:0%
um you just get that in front of me
um

04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:21.050 --> 04:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
the actual paragraph that is even more
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
tortured in my opinion in my opinion is
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
the one that appears on the petition
 
04:44:28.610 --> 04:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
that if someone files in the court
 
04:44:28.620 --> 04:44:31.730 align:start position:0%
that if someone files in the court
because

04:44:31.730 --> 04:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
how the form reads is it really is you
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
check off
 
04:44:37.490 --> 04:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
certain things that you think that the
 
04:44:39.650 --> 04:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
ward is incapable of handling on their
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
own so when you check off the part about
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
accessing grants and releasing or having
 
04:44:48.170 --> 04:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
right to their own medical records it's
 
04:44:50.208 --> 04:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
such a very it's a very broad category
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
and depriving somebody of a lot of
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
Rights without being able to further
 
04:44:57.650 --> 04:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
narrow it down so I think that the the
 
04:44:59.930 --> 04:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
guardianship petitions in themselves
 
04:45:03.010 --> 04:45:03.020 align:start position:0%
need some revisions
 
04:45:05.330 --> 04:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
but also
 
04:45:08.208 --> 04:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
the law itself needs to expressly state
 
04:45:10.070 --> 04:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
that you can't take away somebody's
 
04:45:12.010 --> 04:45:12.020 align:start position:0%
right to their own
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
personal records with you know absent a
 
04:45:17.868 --> 04:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
good finding a good specific reason to
 
04:45:23.208 --> 04:45:23.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:25.070 --> 04:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions for attorney Tasker
 
04:45:28.010 --> 04:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative Chase thank you very
 
04:45:29.570 --> 04:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
04:45:32.090 --> 04:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
my question I was a guardian for my
 
04:45:33.890 --> 04:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
daughter until she passed away three
 
04:45:36.530 --> 04:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
years ago I'm very familiar with this I
 
04:45:39.288 --> 04:45:39.298 align:start position:0%
also was the Prime sponsor of supported
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
decision making which is now a law
 
04:45:43.628 --> 04:45:43.638 align:start position:0%
what I
 
04:45:47.390 --> 04:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
want to just know is are most of the
 
04:45:49.250 --> 04:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
things that are coming up here and the
 
04:45:51.410 --> 04:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
issues you're having are they with State
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
appointed Guardians versus family
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
Guardian it's it's with all Guardians
 
04:46:00.288 --> 04:46:00.298 align:start position:0%
it's not a particular subset of
 
04:46:04.128 --> 04:46:04.138 align:start position:0%
Guardians it's when you actually get an
 
04:46:06.170 --> 04:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
order from the court which obviously
 
04:46:07.750 --> 04:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
you're aware of what those look like
 
04:46:10.788 --> 04:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
I've included a redacted order it's the
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
last two pages of this little packet
 
04:46:14.930 --> 04:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
that's being circulated and I
 
04:46:18.410 --> 04:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
highlighted the language that comes in
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
the um in the order and it's and it's
 
04:46:21.120 --> 04:46:22.390 align:start position:0%
the um in the order and it's and it's
fairly

04:46:22.390 --> 04:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
boilerplate to some extent when it's a
 
04:46:28.270 --> 04:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
when it's included in the order
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
and it
 
04:46:30.480 --> 04:46:32.090 align:start position:0%
and it
it's

04:46:32.090 --> 04:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
whatever type of Guardian is being
 
04:46:35.160 --> 04:46:37.788 align:start position:0%
whatever type of Guardian is being
um

04:46:37.788 --> 04:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.890 --> 04:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
put in place whether it's a private
 
04:46:41.810 --> 04:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
Guardian a family guardian or a public
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
Guardian this applies to them all across
 
04:46:48.350 --> 04:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
the board so my experience and then
 
04:46:50.570 --> 04:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
looking over my own case files you know
 
04:46:55.128 --> 04:46:55.138 align:start position:0%
I took a sampling of them to see and how
 
04:46:57.948 --> 04:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
many instances what was this paragraph
 
04:47:00.110 --> 04:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
about having access to and granting
 
04:47:03.650 --> 04:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
release of of personal records
 
04:47:03.660 --> 04:47:04.190 align:start position:0%
release of of personal records
um

04:47:04.190 --> 04:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:06.590 --> 04:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
and it was pretty much in every single
 
04:47:08.208 --> 04:47:08.218 align:start position:0%
order that I had
 
04:47:08.218 --> 04:47:09.070 align:start position:0%
order that I had
um

04:47:09.070 --> 04:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:12.530 --> 04:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
probably because every single order that
 
04:47:14.208 --> 04:47:14.218 align:start position:0%
I have for a guardian when somebody
 
04:47:15.948 --> 04:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
needs a guardianship they are really
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
needing somebody to have
 
04:47:20.930 --> 04:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
um the authority to make medical or
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
financial decisions so of course the
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
guardian needs access to those records
 
04:47:28.190 --> 04:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
that would make sense but it shouldn't
 
04:47:30.650 --> 04:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
simultaneously deprive The Ward from
 
04:47:32.830 --> 04:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
having the same access
 
04:47:35.448 --> 04:47:35.458 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that the ward should be
 
04:47:38.330 --> 04:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
able to make decisions with regard to
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
those to those issues but should be able
 
04:47:44.510 --> 04:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
to have access to see what is happening
 
04:47:46.368 --> 04:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
in his or her own life whether it's
 
04:47:48.650 --> 04:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
Financial whether it's medical decisions
 
04:47:51.530 --> 04:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be and that the court
 
04:47:51.540 --> 04:47:52.930 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be and that the court
only

04:47:52.930 --> 04:47:52.940 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:47:57.050 --> 04:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
Implement a restriction on that when
 
04:48:00.410 --> 04:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
there is actually good cause to do so
 
04:48:03.050 --> 04:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
representative Chase thank you just a
 
04:48:06.310 --> 04:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up do you know when and if
 
04:48:08.570 --> 04:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
guardianships have been altered or
 
04:48:10.270 --> 04:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
changed at all
 
04:48:16.128 --> 04:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
do meaning the I was to do and what lack
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
of control she had over her self right I
 
04:48:21.050 --> 04:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
didn't deny her because she's my
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
daughter but I understand that so I was
 
04:48:26.270 --> 04:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
asking is it court now when is the last
 
04:48:28.270 --> 04:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
time that the actual New Hampshire
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
guardianship law has been changed or
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
altered is this going to be the first
 
04:48:36.530 --> 04:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
time no I mean it's I would say I mean
 
04:48:38.448 --> 04:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
it was off altered in the last session
 
04:48:39.890 --> 04:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
of course
 
04:48:43.490 --> 04:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and it's there's always bills I think
 
04:48:46.850 --> 04:48:46.860 align:start position:0%
every single year about guardianships
 
04:48:50.208 --> 04:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
um so this wouldn't be uncommon for
 
04:48:55.010 --> 04:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:58.550 --> 04:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
personally struck me this year to see a
 
04:49:00.110 --> 04:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
certain client of mine's individual
 
04:49:02.448 --> 04:49:02.458 align:start position:0%
struggle with not being able to have
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
these records in the in the actual
 
04:49:07.368 --> 04:49:07.378 align:start position:0%
effect it had on her
 
04:49:07.378 --> 04:49:08.330 align:start position:0%
effect it had on her
um

04:49:08.330 --> 04:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:10.610 --> 04:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
it was pretty detrimental to her her
 
04:49:12.830 --> 04:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
emotional well-being
 
04:49:12.840 --> 04:49:13.730 align:start position:0%
emotional well-being
um

04:49:13.730 --> 04:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
and so I think
 
04:49:17.690 --> 04:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
um as as I think you were you were
 
04:49:20.330 --> 04:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
saying that when you file for a
 
04:49:22.550 --> 04:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
guardianship you think you're getting a
 
04:49:24.890 --> 04:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
narrow sort of
 
04:49:28.010 --> 04:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
um limitation on the wards
 
04:49:31.128 --> 04:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
um rights and that the guardian is only
 
04:49:34.610 --> 04:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
being afforded certain Authority in some
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
instances it comes down to what the
 
04:49:39.470 --> 04:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
court makes a finding about and I
 
04:49:42.530 --> 04:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
certainly have experienced that the
 
04:49:45.230 --> 04:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
court has expanded
 
04:49:46.670 --> 04:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
um findings
 
04:49:48.190 --> 04:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
in in
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
greater than what is actually on the
 
04:49:53.570 --> 04:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
petition so if you
 
04:49:56.570 --> 04:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
um if you were to look at the petition
 
04:49:56.580 --> 04:49:57.650 align:start position:0%
um if you were to look at the petition
um

04:49:57.650 --> 04:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:59.628 --> 04:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
I highlighted this as well because it's
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
so many pages of of
 
04:50:04.730 --> 04:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
it's on the
 
04:50:04.740 --> 04:50:06.050 align:start position:0%
it's on the
one

04:50:06.050 --> 04:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:50:06.060 --> 04:50:07.788 align:start position:0%
one
two

04:50:07.788 --> 04:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:50:11.390 --> 04:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
three four it's on the fourth page in on
 
04:50:14.090 --> 04:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
the bottom it says page 304
 
04:50:17.208 --> 04:50:17.218 align:start position:0%
um with that page right there is sort of
 
04:50:19.788 --> 04:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
the checklist of of
 
04:50:19.798 --> 04:50:20.410 align:start position:0%
the checklist of of
um

04:50:20.410 --> 04:50:20.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
of rights that the ward has that we're
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
seeking to limit and if you can see that
 
04:50:30.010 --> 04:50:30.020 align:start position:0%
they're they're pretty broad categories
 
04:50:33.948 --> 04:50:33.958 align:start position:0%
and if I file a petition I often will be
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
very choosy about what I want
 
04:50:36.718 --> 04:50:37.490 align:start position:0%
very choosy about what I want
um

04:50:37.490 --> 04:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:40.368 --> 04:50:40.378 align:start position:0%
um you know sort of taken away the
 
04:50:42.890 --> 04:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
rights of the ward however I routinely
 
04:50:46.010 --> 04:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
see other petitioners check off every
 
04:50:48.410 --> 04:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
single box even other but nothing is
 
04:50:49.610 --> 04:50:49.620 align:start position:0%
left you know nothing is written in
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
where it says other
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and so what happens is that
 
04:50:56.810 --> 04:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
um you know if there's nobody contesting
 
04:50:59.510 --> 04:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
the guardianship
 
04:51:02.090 --> 04:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
um you know these these they they get
 
04:51:04.610 --> 04:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
included in the order and sometimes the
 
04:51:07.250 --> 04:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
judge might make it an expanded finding
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
and include certain things that the
 
04:51:11.570 --> 04:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
petitioner wasn't seeking also so it's
 
04:51:13.730 --> 04:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
hard to hard to say I can't really say
 
04:51:16.610 --> 04:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
why it always is is greater than I think
 
04:51:18.050 --> 04:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
what it should be
 
04:51:20.410 --> 04:51:20.420 align:start position:0%
um but I do think that it comes down to
 
04:51:23.448 --> 04:51:23.458 align:start position:0%
a lot of times it being the person of
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
filing for guardianship not
 
04:51:27.410 --> 04:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
understanding that they should really be
 
04:51:29.208 --> 04:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
careful about what rights they are
 
04:51:33.770 --> 04:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:33.780 --> 04:51:34.788 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:51:39.650 --> 04:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:41.448 --> 04:51:41.458 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
04:51:45.830 --> 04:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:55.310 --> 04:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
seeing no one will close the hearing on
 
04:51:59.810 --> 04:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.510 --> 04:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
at this point in time our next hearing
 
04:52:06.410 --> 04:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
isn't scheduled to be until 2 15. I
 
04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
obviously misjudged how much testimony
 
04:52:12.730 --> 04:52:12.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
and so uh we'll take a recess until 2
 
04:52:16.080 --> 04:52:26.090 align:start position:0%
and so uh we'll take a recess until 2
15.

04:52:26.090 --> 04:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
you want to give that to the person who
 
04:52:38.288 --> 04:52:38.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:06.730 --> 04:53:06.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:10.128 --> 04:53:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:10.138 --> 04:54:12.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:54:12.170 --> 04:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.180 --> 05:15:58.868 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
we'll call the house Judiciary Committee
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
back to order
 
05:16:06.410 --> 05:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
our next item of business is a scheduled
 
05:16:09.650 --> 05:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1448 relative to
 
05:16:12.050 --> 05:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
the pre-termitted air statute
 
05:16:15.650 --> 05:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
and we'll call upon the prime sponsor
 
05:16:17.570 --> 05:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:16:19.680 --> 05:16:21.110 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
committee

05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:16:21.120 --> 05:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
committee
um

05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:25.010 --> 05:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
I want you to know that at the asset
 
05:16:27.050 --> 05:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
that this is not something that I that
 
05:16:29.510 --> 05:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is like a passion for me that I
 
05:16:31.930 --> 05:16:31.940 align:start position:0%
spend my life on USC
 
05:16:34.368 --> 05:16:34.378 align:start position:0%
it's definitely something I'm sure that
 
05:16:36.530 --> 05:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
you know we could if you if you spend
 
05:16:37.788 --> 05:16:37.798 align:start position:0%
too much time on it we could all be
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
snoring before long but I think it
 
05:16:44.330 --> 05:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
really is an important matter
 
05:16:44.340 --> 05:16:44.990 align:start position:0%
really is an important matter
um

05:16:44.990 --> 05:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:47.330 --> 05:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
if I can start off
 
05:16:49.250 --> 05:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
um if I could just take a second let me
 
05:16:51.890 --> 05:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
read to you the current pre-termitted
 
05:16:56.090 --> 05:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
air statute which is RSA 55110 and what
 
05:16:58.550 --> 05:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
it says and I'm quoting now is every
 
05:17:01.610 --> 05:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
child born after the deceased of the
 
05:17:04.010 --> 05:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
testator that's the person making the
 
05:17:07.490 --> 05:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
will and every child or issue of a child
 
05:17:10.910 --> 05:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the deceased not named or referred to
 
05:17:14.448 --> 05:17:14.458 align:start position:0%
in his will and who is not a devisee or
 
05:17:17.330 --> 05:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
Legacy shall be entitled to the same
 
05:17:19.010 --> 05:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
portion of the estate
 
05:17:22.610 --> 05:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
real and personal as would be if the
 
05:17:25.010 --> 05:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
deceased were in testing so they that
 
05:17:27.530 --> 05:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
what that basically says is if you don't
 
05:17:27.540 --> 05:17:29.208 align:start position:0%
what that basically says is if you don't
mention

05:17:29.208 --> 05:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
mention
 
05:17:31.910 --> 05:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
um it covers two circumstances an
 
05:17:34.610 --> 05:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
after-born child and a child not
 
05:17:36.288 --> 05:17:36.298 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the will
 
05:17:36.298 --> 05:17:37.730 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the will
and

05:17:37.730 --> 05:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:40.490 --> 05:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are there are the
 
05:17:42.350 --> 05:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
way our statute has been interpreted
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
over the years but you know for a number
 
05:17:46.970 --> 05:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
of years by the Supreme Court it can
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
operate pretty harshly to really kind of
 
05:17:50.878 --> 05:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
operate pretty harshly to really kind of
undermine

05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
undermine
 
05:17:57.410 --> 05:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
the the testator's intent and so this
 
05:18:00.250 --> 05:18:00.260 align:start position:0%
bill is designed
 
05:18:05.208 --> 05:18:05.218 align:start position:0%
to to correct that and it does it in in
 
05:18:08.510 --> 05:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of ways the first is that as I
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the current statute
 
05:18:13.010 --> 05:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
applies in two circumstances
 
05:18:15.948 --> 05:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
at a child born after you've made the
 
05:18:18.170 --> 05:18:18.180 align:start position:0%
will or adopted after you've made the
 
05:18:21.708 --> 05:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
will number one and then secondly and
 
05:18:23.090 --> 05:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
this is where I think there's really the
 
05:18:26.510 --> 05:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
problem a child that's not named a child
 
05:18:28.190 --> 05:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
that already you know that that was
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
alive at the time you made the will but
 
05:18:31.850 --> 05:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
is not named in the will
 
05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
and it's the second category that second
 
05:18:36.830 --> 05:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
category that I think is caught causes
 
05:18:38.930 --> 05:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
most of the problems
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and so this the proposed legislation
 
05:18:44.530 --> 05:18:44.540 align:start position:0%
that you have before you
 
05:18:47.990 --> 05:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
eliminates that provision it doesn't the
 
05:18:52.310 --> 05:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
statute would not apply to a child that
 
05:18:54.890 --> 05:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
was born at the time you drafted the
 
05:18:58.730 --> 05:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
will who was not named in the will and
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
and candidly I think you know the
 
05:19:04.250 --> 05:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
the existing statute is based on the
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
idea which I think if if you think about
 
05:19:09.650 --> 05:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
it really does not make a lot of sense
 
05:19:12.170 --> 05:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
and that is the uh if you
 
05:19:13.970 --> 05:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
Theory with regard to after born
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
children is you made a will you had two
 
05:19:19.250 --> 05:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
kids and then after you made the will
 
05:19:20.750 --> 05:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
you had a third kid and you just forgot
 
05:19:22.730 --> 05:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
to change the will that's something I
 
05:19:24.350 --> 05:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
think we can all sort of understand
 
05:19:26.448 --> 05:19:26.458 align:start position:0%
could happen you just you know you had a
 
05:19:27.948 --> 05:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
million things to do and you just didn't
 
05:19:31.550 --> 05:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
think about uh changing the will
 
05:19:34.970 --> 05:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
but if you have let's say two children
 
05:19:38.390 --> 05:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
and you make a will knowing you have two
 
05:19:38.400 --> 05:19:39.470 align:start position:0%
and you make a will knowing you have two
children

05:19:39.470 --> 05:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:19:41.390 --> 05:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
and you don't mention one of the
 
05:19:43.010 --> 05:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
children in the will
 
05:19:44.990 --> 05:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know the idea that you just forgot
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
about them uh
 
05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
that's that seems to me that's probably
 
05:19:52.850 --> 05:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
a a stretch that you that you just
 
05:19:55.310 --> 05:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
forgot about a child that you knew you
 
05:19:55.320 --> 05:19:56.570 align:start position:0%
forgot about a child that you knew you
had

05:19:56.570 --> 05:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
um so that so the the bill is designed
 
05:20:01.970 --> 05:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
to eliminate that um
 
05:20:04.990 --> 05:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
that Circumstance
 
05:20:07.670 --> 05:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
the the second thing and this is
 
05:20:11.090 --> 05:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
probably even the as important is that
 
05:20:15.890 --> 05:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
under the current statute if the if the
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
pre-terminated air statue comes into
 
05:20:18.240 --> 05:20:19.788 align:start position:0%
pre-terminated air statue comes into
play

05:20:19.788 --> 05:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
play
 
05:20:23.330 --> 05:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
there's only one result and that is that
 
05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
the the child that was not named gets an
 
05:20:31.070 --> 05:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
intestate share of the estate and that
 
05:20:33.430 --> 05:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
can mean for for example
 
05:20:36.410 --> 05:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
let's suppose that
 
05:20:41.208 --> 05:20:41.218 align:start position:0%
um a person dies and has
 
05:20:46.190 --> 05:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh for uh children and provides in the
 
05:20:49.550 --> 05:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
will for three of them uh equally but
 
05:20:51.948 --> 05:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
makes no provision for the for the
 
05:20:55.250 --> 05:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
fourth child under the under the statute
 
05:20:58.628 --> 05:20:58.638 align:start position:0%
the fourth child would get the the
 
05:21:01.490 --> 05:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
intestate share of the will which is
 
05:21:04.970 --> 05:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
which is much more than just a fourth in
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
other words it would it can it can
 
05:21:09.650 --> 05:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
disproportionately benefit the uh the
 
05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
pre-termitted heir another example
 
05:21:16.670 --> 05:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
suppose that a person has a child
 
05:21:20.090 --> 05:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and is married has a child and leaves
 
05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
everything and and the the person who's
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
married has a child the the wife is the
 
05:21:29.810 --> 05:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
mother of the child it's a you know sort
 
05:21:31.430 --> 05:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
of an intact family
 
05:21:35.208 --> 05:21:35.218 align:start position:0%
and the person leaves everything to
 
05:21:37.490 --> 05:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
his wife
 
05:21:40.550 --> 05:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
but doesn't mention anything about the
 
05:21:43.430 --> 05:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
child in the will
 
05:21:45.530 --> 05:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
under the current law what that would
 
05:21:49.490 --> 05:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
mean is that the child would be able to
 
05:21:52.970 --> 05:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
take the the intestate share under the
 
05:21:52.980 --> 05:21:54.590 align:start position:0%
take the the intestate share under the
will

05:21:54.590 --> 05:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:21:56.628 --> 05:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
cutting off what the wife would have
 
05:21:58.970 --> 05:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
otherwise gotten under the will even
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
though in that circumstance you know I
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
think most most people would say if
 
05:22:07.190 --> 05:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're married and you and your spouse
 
05:22:09.708 --> 05:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
have a child and and you leave
 
05:22:12.530 --> 05:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
everything to your wife your probably
 
05:22:15.470 --> 05:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
your intent is that the you know she as
 
05:22:17.930 --> 05:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
the one who lie who do dies later she's
 
05:22:19.310 --> 05:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
going to be the one that takes care of
 
05:22:21.890 --> 05:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
the child but this would the the current
 
05:22:25.010 --> 05:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
law would would cut that cut off that
 
05:22:28.970 --> 05:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
intent the statute as as as proposed is
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
designed to eliminate those harsh
 
05:22:36.490 --> 05:22:36.500 align:start position:0%
consequences by making the law
 
05:22:40.368 --> 05:22:40.378 align:start position:0%
consistent with what what you know it's
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable to in infer the testator
 
05:22:47.030 --> 05:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
desire to accomplish and so I think
 
05:22:48.948 --> 05:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
05:22:52.490 --> 05:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
um this is an important change
 
05:22:55.368 --> 05:22:55.378 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the cases that um I
 
05:22:57.650 --> 05:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
was discussing with your your chair just
 
05:23:00.050 --> 05:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
be before we went on the record was
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
there was a case decided by the New
 
05:23:03.050 --> 05:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court about a year ago
 
05:23:05.030 --> 05:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
and again I don't mean I don't in any
 
05:23:06.530 --> 05:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
way criticize the court I think they
 
05:23:08.690 --> 05:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
were following their precedent of the
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
way the statute has been interpreted for
 
05:23:10.680 --> 05:23:11.448 align:start position:0%
way the statute has been interpreted for
years

05:23:11.448 --> 05:23:11.458 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:23:15.530 --> 05:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
but it was a situation where a a woman
 
05:23:15.540 --> 05:23:17.390 align:start position:0%
but it was a situation where a a woman
had

05:23:17.390 --> 05:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:23:21.530 --> 05:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
um left a had she made a will in
 
05:23:23.270 --> 05:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts after she made the will
 
05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
she moved to New Hampshire she left
 
05:23:26.520 --> 05:23:27.170 align:start position:0%
she moved to New Hampshire she left
um

05:23:27.170 --> 05:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:30.970 --> 05:23:30.980 align:start position:0%
her estate to her daughter-in-law
 
05:23:33.770 --> 05:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
and there was specific language in the
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
will that said you know up to the extent
 
05:23:37.368 --> 05:23:37.378 align:start position:0%
I'm not to the extent I haven't left
 
05:23:39.050 --> 05:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
anything to anybody else I'm doing this
 
05:23:39.060 --> 05:23:40.208 align:start position:0%
anything to anybody else I'm doing this
intentionally

05:23:40.208 --> 05:23:40.218 align:start position:0%
intentionally
 
05:23:44.690 --> 05:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
but she didn't specifically say I'm not
 
05:23:47.530 --> 05:23:47.540 align:start position:0%
leaving anything to my son
 
05:23:50.750 --> 05:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
and the Court held that the son was
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
entitled to the to take as a
 
05:23:56.330 --> 05:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
pre-tremitted Heir under the statute
 
05:23:58.490 --> 05:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
um based upon our you know based upon
 
05:24:00.650 --> 05:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
the case law I've talked about even
 
05:24:02.930 --> 05:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
though it really seemed
 
05:24:05.090 --> 05:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that though you know that
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
the woman's intent was to leave it to
 
05:24:09.770 --> 05:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
her daughter-in-law as opposed to her
 
05:24:12.410 --> 05:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
son and even though as I said the will
 
05:24:14.270 --> 05:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
was drafted in Massachusetts and under
 
05:24:16.550 --> 05:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts law if the woman had
 
05:24:18.050 --> 05:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
remained in had been a resident of
 
05:24:20.330 --> 05:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts at the time of her death
 
05:24:22.128 --> 05:24:22.138 align:start position:0%
her her intent would have been
 
05:24:23.690 --> 05:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
effectuated it would have been proper
 
05:24:26.330 --> 05:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
under Massachusetts law and so I think
 
05:24:28.550 --> 05:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's just kind of an example of of
 
05:24:30.530 --> 05:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
sort of the harsh consequences that can
 
05:24:32.150 --> 05:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
exist under
 
05:24:32.160 --> 05:24:32.690 align:start position:0%
exist under
um

05:24:32.690 --> 05:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:35.690 --> 05:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
the current law and this is
 
05:24:37.610 --> 05:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
um this proposal is designed to
 
05:24:40.550 --> 05:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
alleviate that and it um
 
05:24:42.890 --> 05:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
05:24:45.830 --> 05:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
the the procedures as you'll see in the
 
05:24:49.128 --> 05:24:49.138 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the text of the statute
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
um it's not completely the model Penal
 
05:24:54.770 --> 05:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
Code I model uh probate code but it
 
05:24:58.010 --> 05:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
comes close to it um so it's you know
 
05:25:00.050 --> 05:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
it's something that I think has been
 
05:25:02.750 --> 05:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
thought out by people who really are
 
05:25:05.570 --> 05:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
experts in the in this area and I I'm
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
the first to admit that I am not and at
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
all an expert in this area
 
05:25:13.208 --> 05:25:13.218 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I would say is I did
 
05:25:15.230 --> 05:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
circulate this
 
05:25:19.128 --> 05:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
to uh the probate bar actually
 
05:25:21.708 --> 05:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
it was a while ago now back in October
 
05:25:23.570 --> 05:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
um when I when this was first uh
 
05:25:23.580 --> 05:25:25.250 align:start position:0%
um when I when this was first uh
proposed

05:25:25.250 --> 05:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
05:25:27.708 --> 05:25:27.718 align:start position:0%
um and I I'm unfortunately I only
 
05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
recently heard from them saying that
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
they needed they needed a little more
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
time to uh
 
05:25:37.550 --> 05:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
you know to sort of give input and ask
 
05:25:40.730 --> 05:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
that I ask which I do that I I hope that
 
05:25:44.030 --> 05:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
the committee will not exec this bill
 
05:25:45.708 --> 05:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
um for I think they're meeting they're
 
05:25:47.628 --> 05:25:47.638 align:start position:0%
planning to meet next Tuesday and and
 
05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
you know I've I've suggested to them
 
05:25:52.430 --> 05:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
that there's some need for to kind of
 
05:25:53.868 --> 05:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
move this along and hopefully they will
 
05:25:55.850 --> 05:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
but I I hope you will wait for that
 
05:25:58.010 --> 05:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
because as I say you know there there
 
05:26:00.050 --> 05:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
may be parts of this that things I
 
05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
haven't thought of in here that people
 
05:26:03.770 --> 05:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
who really are experts in this area
 
05:26:05.628 --> 05:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
would think of and would say well you
 
05:26:06.650 --> 05:26:06.660 align:start position:0%
ought to make this change or you ought
 
05:26:08.330 --> 05:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
to make that change
 
05:26:08.340 --> 05:26:08.930 align:start position:0%
to make that change
um

05:26:08.930 --> 05:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
that that kind of thing the only other
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
thing I would say and then I'm happy to
 
05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
answer questions is I would direct your
 
05:26:17.448 --> 05:26:17.458 align:start position:0%
attention specifically to page two as
 
05:26:19.610 --> 05:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
section two on applicability
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
and you'll notice I I try to be very
 
05:26:24.350 --> 05:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
careful in in that section to say to
 
05:26:26.150 --> 05:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
make it clear that it says this actual
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
apply to all Wills executed
 
05:26:32.690 --> 05:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
before or after the effective date of
 
05:26:33.708 --> 05:26:33.718 align:start position:0%
this act
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
except that this act shall not apply to
 
05:26:39.288 --> 05:26:39.298 align:start position:0%
those Wills executed by a testator who
 
05:26:41.390 --> 05:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
died prior to the effective date of the
 
05:26:43.430 --> 05:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
act and I think I put that in there
 
05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
because I think
 
05:26:49.070 --> 05:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
if if on the day this bill became
 
05:26:49.080 --> 05:26:50.510 align:start position:0%
if if on the day this bill became
effective

05:26:50.510 --> 05:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
effective
 
05:26:54.530 --> 05:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
there was a will in which a testator had
 
05:26:56.330 --> 05:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
not named a child
 
05:26:59.150 --> 05:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
but had died the day before this law
 
05:27:02.270 --> 05:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
became effective I think that that the
 
05:27:06.230 --> 05:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
child would have a probably a uh
 
05:27:10.190 --> 05:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
a vested right to to rely on the current
 
05:27:13.490 --> 05:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
law and say I I'm a pre-termitted Heir
 
05:27:15.410 --> 05:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
under the current law and I'm entitled
 
05:27:17.390 --> 05:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
to take and I think if you were to try
 
05:27:18.708 --> 05:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
to change that there might be some
 
05:27:20.990 --> 05:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional problems with doing that
 
05:27:23.150 --> 05:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
but other than that I think it should
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
apply you know when to any circumstance
 
05:27:28.970 --> 05:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
where there's an opportunity to change
 
05:27:31.850 --> 05:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
for the testator to change the will
 
05:27:34.010 --> 05:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take any
 
05:27:34.020 --> 05:27:35.150 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take any
questions

05:27:35.150 --> 05:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:27:38.750 --> 05:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions for Judge Lynn representative
 
05:27:38.760 --> 05:27:41.570 align:start position:0%
questions for Judge Lynn representative
Lynn

05:27:41.570 --> 05:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:43.850 --> 05:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia
 
05:27:47.208 --> 05:27:47.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so on your last Point
 
05:27:50.810 --> 05:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh with applicability
 
05:27:50.820 --> 05:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
uh with applicability
uh

05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:56.390 --> 05:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
will this cause people to have to review
 
05:27:59.628 --> 05:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
their wills and change them possibly as
 
05:28:01.788 --> 05:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
soon as this is enacted and how much of
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
a burden might that be
 
05:28:04.080 --> 05:28:06.050 align:start position:0%
a burden might that be
I

05:28:06.050 --> 05:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:28:08.448 --> 05:28:08.458 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:28:11.448 --> 05:28:11.458 align:start position:0%
it probably would I think it it probably
 
05:28:13.788 --> 05:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
would uh cause you know I mean we
 
05:28:15.470 --> 05:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
certainly would be prudent for a person
 
05:28:17.570 --> 05:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
to do that I think
 
05:28:17.580 --> 05:28:18.410 align:start position:0%
to do that I think
um

05:28:18.410 --> 05:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:21.708 --> 05:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
it because the the general intent of
 
05:28:21.718 --> 05:28:22.610 align:start position:0%
it because the the general intent of
this

05:28:22.610 --> 05:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:28:24.350 --> 05:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
is to make
 
05:28:25.850 --> 05:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
the law
 
05:28:29.510 --> 05:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
more more closely reflect what most
 
05:28:32.570 --> 05:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
people intended whereas the current law
 
05:28:34.850 --> 05:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
I think does not do that
 
05:28:34.860 --> 05:28:35.690 align:start position:0%
I think does not do that
um

05:28:35.690 --> 05:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:38.208 --> 05:28:38.218 align:start position:0%
my impression would be that that you
 
05:28:40.250 --> 05:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
know it would not that even if people
 
05:28:43.070 --> 05:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
didn't do that this law would would
 
05:28:46.850 --> 05:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
would more closely align with what their
 
05:28:49.788 --> 05:28:49.798 align:start position:0%
intent probably was than the existing
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
law but but certainly you know if I were
 
05:28:55.010 --> 05:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
a lawyer and uh in this area of practice
 
05:28:57.650 --> 05:28:57.660 align:start position:0%
I would certainly tell my client you
 
05:28:59.390 --> 05:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
know my probate clients look we ought to
 
05:29:01.128 --> 05:29:01.138 align:start position:0%
you know you wanna we ought to talk
 
05:29:02.448 --> 05:29:02.458 align:start position:0%
about your will just to make sure that
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
there's not something in there that's a
 
05:29:06.410 --> 05:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
that's a problem so I I would definitely
 
05:29:10.970 --> 05:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:13.368 --> 05:29:13.378 align:start position:0%
other question other questions
 
05:29:15.770 --> 05:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative De Lorenzo
 
05:29:17.628 --> 05:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:29:21.948 --> 05:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn my question is um
 
05:29:23.990 --> 05:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how
 
05:29:28.970 --> 05:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
modern times are reflected in this um
 
05:29:32.470 --> 05:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm thinking about
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
children born out of wedlock
 
05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
um that haven't that the
 
05:29:40.128 --> 05:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
deceased hasn't reported to other family
 
05:29:42.948 --> 05:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
members that's unknown and then what
 
05:29:42.958 --> 05:29:43.788 align:start position:0%
members that's unknown and then what
about

05:29:43.788 --> 05:29:43.798 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:29:43.798 --> 05:29:44.448 align:start position:0%
about
um

05:29:44.448 --> 05:29:44.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:44.458 --> 05:29:46.550 align:start position:0%
um
children

05:29:46.550 --> 05:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:29:46.560 --> 05:29:48.708 align:start position:0%
children
born

05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
born
 
05:29:48.718 --> 05:29:50.150 align:start position:0%
born
through

05:29:50.150 --> 05:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:29:50.160 --> 05:29:52.010 align:start position:0%
through
um

05:29:52.010 --> 05:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
artificial insemination or
 
05:29:58.970 --> 05:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
like a not a test tube baby but
 
05:30:02.270 --> 05:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of the penny
 
05:30:05.628 --> 05:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
Andrew yes yes you know I think with
 
05:30:07.128 --> 05:30:07.138 align:start position:0%
regard to let me ask you that answers
 
05:30:08.750 --> 05:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
the last part first I think with regard
 
05:30:12.230 --> 05:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
to in vitro fertilization or adopted
 
05:30:14.628 --> 05:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
children I think this is intended to
 
05:30:14.638 --> 05:30:15.708 align:start position:0%
children I think this is intended to
apply

05:30:15.708 --> 05:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
apply
 
05:30:19.930 --> 05:30:19.940 align:start position:0%
to any you know to any child whether a
 
05:30:22.788 --> 05:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
adopted born through in vitro
 
05:30:25.190 --> 05:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
fertilization or any you know any
 
05:30:27.170 --> 05:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
circumstance like that
 
05:30:30.530 --> 05:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
that the question on your first point is
 
05:30:33.490 --> 05:30:33.500 align:start position:0%
if you know with a let's say a a
 
05:30:38.030 --> 05:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
child born out of wedlock that
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
either the father or the mother uh
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't acknowledge or something like
 
05:30:43.200 --> 05:30:44.570 align:start position:0%
doesn't acknowledge or something like
that

05:30:44.570 --> 05:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:30:47.330 --> 05:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
um the I think the
 
05:30:47.340 --> 05:30:48.830 align:start position:0%
um the I think the
um

05:30:48.830 --> 05:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:53.090 --> 05:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
as long as the child was known to the
 
05:30:57.230 --> 05:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
parent I think the the uh this would the
 
05:30:59.448 --> 05:30:59.458 align:start position:0%
statute would apply and and it it also
 
05:31:01.550 --> 05:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
has the I I didn't mention this and
 
05:31:02.750 --> 05:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
that's I'm glad you raised it because
 
05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
it's a good point there is a provision
 
05:31:06.590 --> 05:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
in here that says
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
that if a child
 
05:31:14.208 --> 05:31:14.218 align:start position:0%
it applies to a child born after a will
 
05:31:15.708 --> 05:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
is made
 
05:31:18.050 --> 05:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
or it PL it also applies in the
 
05:31:20.868 --> 05:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
circumstance where a person knows that
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
they had a child but believes the child
 
05:31:24.650 --> 05:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
is dead
 
05:31:26.690 --> 05:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
so that in other words if you you know
 
05:31:29.230 --> 05:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
if you if you have a child if you if you
 
05:31:31.310 --> 05:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
have a child
 
05:31:34.430 --> 05:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
at the time you make the will but you
 
05:31:34.440 --> 05:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
at the time you make the will but you
believe

05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:31:38.690 --> 05:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
um that the I'm sorry if you if you have
 
05:31:41.330 --> 05:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
a child if you had a child but at the
 
05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
time you make the will you believe the
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
child was dead
 
05:31:47.628 --> 05:31:47.638 align:start position:0%
and then it turns out you find out later
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
that the child was not dead that the
 
05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
child is you know living somewhere then
 
05:31:55.490 --> 05:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
the then the the statute would apply to
 
05:31:57.170 --> 05:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
that circumstance and there's Provisions
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in the language that allow
 
05:32:03.110 --> 05:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
the court to consider the circumstances
 
05:32:05.868 --> 05:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
whether you know whether uh you really
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
believe the child was dead or not and
 
05:32:10.128 --> 05:32:10.138 align:start position:0%
those kind of things but it it is
 
05:32:13.128 --> 05:32:13.138 align:start position:0%
intended to be comprehensive to apply to
 
05:32:14.270 --> 05:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
those sort of
 
05:32:15.830 --> 05:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better you know
 
05:32:18.890 --> 05:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
non-traditional sort of childbirth birth
 
05:32:18.900 --> 05:32:23.090 align:start position:0%
non-traditional sort of childbirth birth
situations

05:32:23.090 --> 05:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:25.550 --> 05:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative Langley
 
05:32:28.430 --> 05:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you representative
 
05:32:31.070 --> 05:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I apologize
 
05:32:32.690 --> 05:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
if you may have covered this while I was
 
05:32:35.208 --> 05:32:35.218 align:start position:0%
out but my question has to do with what
 
05:32:37.628 --> 05:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
if people make an accommodation in there
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
will uh to deal with a child before
 
05:32:42.590 --> 05:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
their death for example they have a
 
05:32:45.350 --> 05:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
fairly substantial estate and they they
 
05:32:47.390 --> 05:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
distribute a portion of that to one
 
05:32:49.970 --> 05:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
child who's struggling during appear
 
05:32:52.190 --> 05:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
earlier in their lifetime and that's the
 
05:32:53.810 --> 05:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
reason they've left that person out of
 
05:32:54.650 --> 05:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
the will
 
05:32:56.930 --> 05:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
how would the court become aware of that
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
and and how would they deal with that
 
05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
with the remaining children and right no
 
05:33:03.590 --> 05:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and the
 
05:33:03.600 --> 05:33:05.330 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and the
statute

05:33:05.330 --> 05:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:33:10.610 --> 05:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
does um does provide as I direct you to
 
05:33:14.930 --> 05:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numeral two on the bottom of
 
05:33:17.510 --> 05:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
the the first page of the actual text
 
05:33:20.208 --> 05:33:20.218 align:start position:0%
and it it says it basically says that
 
05:33:23.570 --> 05:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
the statute does not apply
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
if it appears from the will that the
 
05:33:25.680 --> 05:33:26.750 align:start position:0%
if it appears from the will that the
omission

05:33:26.750 --> 05:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
omission
 
05:33:31.190 --> 05:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
was intentional or the testator provided
 
05:33:33.288 --> 05:33:33.298 align:start position:0%
for the omitted after born or after
 
05:33:34.910 --> 05:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
adopted child
 
05:33:38.448 --> 05:33:38.458 align:start position:0%
by transfer outside of outside the will
 
05:33:40.610 --> 05:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
and the intent that the transfer being
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
lieu of a testamentary provision is
 
05:33:46.070 --> 05:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
shown by the test before statements or
 
05:33:47.770 --> 05:33:47.780 align:start position:0%
as reasonably
 
05:33:50.150 --> 05:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
inferable from other evidence
 
05:33:52.910 --> 05:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
so that in other words the one of the
 
05:33:55.970 --> 05:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
real problems with the current law is
 
05:33:58.550 --> 05:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
the testator's intent as the case law is
 
05:33:59.990 --> 05:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
very clear the testatory's intent is
 
05:34:01.970 --> 05:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
irrelevant doesn't matter what the
 
05:34:04.430 --> 05:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
testator intended to do if you don't
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
name the you know if basically
 
05:34:10.550 --> 05:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
the law is pretty close to being if you
 
05:34:12.650 --> 05:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
want to disinherit if you want to
 
05:34:14.690 --> 05:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
disinherit a child that is living when
 
05:34:15.830 --> 05:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
you make the will
 
05:34:17.750 --> 05:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
you pretty much have to say I'm
 
05:34:20.750 --> 05:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
disinheriting Stevie you know he's he's
 
05:34:23.208 --> 05:34:23.218 align:start position:0%
a spendthrifter he never treated me
 
05:34:25.610 --> 05:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
right during my life or whatever I'm
 
05:34:28.128 --> 05:34:28.138 align:start position:0%
disinheriting Steve and if you don't say
 
05:34:28.138 --> 05:34:29.330 align:start position:0%
disinheriting Steve and if you don't say
that

05:34:29.330 --> 05:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:34:30.890 --> 05:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
um then then the free trimmer to the air
 
05:34:34.730 --> 05:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
statute would apply whereas this this uh
 
05:34:36.530 --> 05:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
statute is designed to basically say
 
05:34:39.010 --> 05:34:39.020 align:start position:0%
look the Court gives the court more
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
ability to really look into the
 
05:34:43.368 --> 05:34:43.378 align:start position:0%
circumstance what did the testator
 
05:34:45.890 --> 05:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
really intend
 
05:34:48.110 --> 05:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
um okay in making a and making a
 
05:34:50.930 --> 05:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
decision and I think that's a good thing
 
05:34:53.690 --> 05:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
05:35:01.128 --> 05:35:01.138 align:start position:0%
just so I understand the the way this is
 
05:35:01.138 --> 05:35:03.530 align:start position:0%
just so I understand the the way this is
constructed

05:35:03.530 --> 05:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
05:35:09.288 --> 05:35:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:12.770 --> 05:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
to now only apply to circumstances where
 
05:35:16.490 --> 05:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
there is a child born or adopted after
 
05:35:18.650 --> 05:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
the estate planning document the will
 
05:35:22.850 --> 05:35:22.860 align:start position:0%
was completed that's correct and the or
 
05:35:24.770 --> 05:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
or the or the child that you thought was
 
05:35:27.530 --> 05:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
dead or or the child is dead
 
05:35:30.050 --> 05:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
05:35:34.070 --> 05:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
and the current statute 551-10 applies
 
05:35:36.110 --> 05:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
to Cho not only children that were born
 
05:35:39.288 --> 05:35:39.298 align:start position:0%
after the will was made or adopted or
 
05:35:40.670 --> 05:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
I'm dead
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
it applies to all children children that
 
05:35:46.128 --> 05:35:46.138 align:start position:0%
were born that aren't mentioned in the
 
05:35:48.350 --> 05:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
will but were born prior to the will was
 
05:35:50.030 --> 05:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
made so
 
05:35:55.368 --> 05:35:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:57.590 --> 05:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
children that were born during the
 
05:36:00.770 --> 05:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
marriage will no longer be well could no
 
05:36:03.470 --> 05:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
longer be deemed pre-intermitted heirs
 
05:36:05.208 --> 05:36:05.218 align:start position:0%
that's correct in other words if you
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't I think under this if you don't if
 
05:36:10.910 --> 05:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
you if if you if if at the time you make
 
05:36:13.788 --> 05:36:13.798 align:start position:0%
a will you have children that you know
 
05:36:15.410 --> 05:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
about you don't think they're dead you
 
05:36:17.208 --> 05:36:17.218 align:start position:0%
know mistakenly you have children and
 
05:36:19.250 --> 05:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
you know about the children and you
 
05:36:21.708 --> 05:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
don't name them then then they're
 
05:36:23.810 --> 05:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
they're disinherited that's you know
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's you've it's presumed that you
 
05:36:27.050 --> 05:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
knew what you were doing when you made
 
05:36:29.390 --> 05:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
the will and if you didn't if you didn't
 
05:36:32.510 --> 05:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
name them as you know as uh
 
05:36:35.930 --> 05:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
getting some bequest then then they
 
05:36:40.310 --> 05:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:42.948 --> 05:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
okay and if I could take that one step
 
05:36:44.270 --> 05:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
further so
 
05:36:48.650 --> 05:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
if you did have an illegitimate child
 
05:36:51.470 --> 05:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
and not know about it prior to your
 
05:36:54.050 --> 05:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
death but that child came forward
 
05:36:54.060 --> 05:36:56.868 align:start position:0%
death but that child came forward
afterwards

05:36:56.868 --> 05:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
05:37:00.350 --> 05:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
they would not have a right to take
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
I think that's right if you didn't know
 
05:37:07.128 --> 05:37:07.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:09.170 --> 05:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
interesting question if you didn't know
 
05:37:11.090 --> 05:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
about the child
 
05:37:11.100 --> 05:37:11.810 align:start position:0%
about the child
um

05:37:11.810 --> 05:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:13.970 --> 05:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting I'm not sure that
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
this specifically addresses that but
 
05:37:17.690 --> 05:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
that's a very good you know maybe it
 
05:37:19.730 --> 05:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
should maybe it should address that and
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
that that would be something that I will
 
05:37:25.610 --> 05:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
I will be sure to talk to the sort of
 
05:37:26.930 --> 05:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
probate experts on but that's a very
 
05:37:28.670 --> 05:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
good that's a very good point
 
05:37:28.680 --> 05:37:33.050 align:start position:0%
good that's a very good point
um

05:37:33.050 --> 05:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:34.610 --> 05:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Langley did you
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
have a question uh thank you thank you
 
05:37:40.010 --> 05:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn once again
 
05:37:43.490 --> 05:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
if if I had four children and one of
 
05:37:47.090 --> 05:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
them expired prior to prior to my death
 
05:37:49.850 --> 05:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
and then I died and didn't wasn't
 
05:37:51.708 --> 05:37:51.718 align:start position:0%
specific about the will the court made
 
05:37:54.350 --> 05:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
the decisions would a certain percentage
 
05:37:57.410 --> 05:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
go to that child who had died children
 
05:37:59.868 --> 05:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
if they had a family I.E that would be
 
05:38:02.448 --> 05:38:02.458 align:start position:0%
my grandchildren or would it just be
 
05:38:04.750 --> 05:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
divided equally among the three living
 
05:38:07.788 --> 05:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
survivors a gen I think generally it
 
05:38:10.368 --> 05:38:10.378 align:start position:0%
would go the the survivors the
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
grandchildren so to speak would
 
05:38:15.110 --> 05:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
pardon I'm sorry oh I'm sorry I think
 
05:38:17.510 --> 05:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
generally the grandchildren would take
 
05:38:20.330 --> 05:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
by what's called representation okay
 
05:38:22.970 --> 05:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
um so that uh you know I mean again if
 
05:38:25.070 --> 05:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
they were that this assumes if you
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
didn't mention
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
the child you know
 
05:38:30.410 --> 05:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
um then that that would be a different
 
05:38:33.170 --> 05:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
situation but assuming that you
 
05:38:35.690 --> 05:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned your four children and by you
 
05:38:37.730 --> 05:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
know in the will and at the time but at
 
05:38:40.730 --> 05:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
the time of of your death one of those
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
children had already died
 
05:38:42.958 --> 05:38:43.850 align:start position:0%
children had already died
um

05:38:43.850 --> 05:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:46.250 --> 05:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
the chill the children of those children
 
05:38:48.410 --> 05:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
that is the grandchildren would take by
 
05:38:50.990 --> 05:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
what's called representation okay
 
05:38:53.930 --> 05:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:57.288 --> 05:38:57.298 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Lynn
 
05:39:00.590 --> 05:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative Simpson
 
05:39:02.330 --> 05:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn for taking my
 
05:39:03.840 --> 05:39:05.270 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn for taking my
question

05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:39:08.510 --> 05:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me how the current
 
05:39:12.530 --> 05:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
statute deals with um the pre-termitted
 
05:39:15.288 --> 05:39:15.298 align:start position:0%
air how that came about like why is it
 
05:39:18.230 --> 05:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
written now as it is to ensure that all
 
05:39:20.868 --> 05:39:20.878 align:start position:0%
the children have the rights right you
 
05:39:22.430 --> 05:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
know if this statute has been on the
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
books for a really long time I believe
 
05:39:27.288 --> 05:39:27.298 align:start position:0%
it goes back into the 1800s and maybe
 
05:39:30.410 --> 05:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
earlier and I think
 
05:39:30.420 --> 05:39:31.190 align:start position:0%
earlier and I think
um

05:39:31.190 --> 05:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:34.788 --> 05:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
you know the with regard to the first
 
05:39:36.590 --> 05:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
with regard to the first part about
 
05:39:39.170 --> 05:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
after born children I think it really
 
05:39:41.810 --> 05:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
reflects kind of you know an awareness
 
05:39:44.030 --> 05:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
that people may you know write writing a
 
05:39:45.470 --> 05:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
will isn't the first thing on people's
 
05:39:46.850 --> 05:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
mind and they might write a will and
 
05:39:48.650 --> 05:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
then have more children and they may
 
05:39:50.868 --> 05:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
forget to change the will
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to the second part about it
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
not you know about what happens if you
 
05:40:00.708 --> 05:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
don't name children that are born and
 
05:40:04.010 --> 05:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
alive at the time you make the the will
 
05:40:04.020 --> 05:40:05.330 align:start position:0%
alive at the time you make the the will
um

05:40:05.330 --> 05:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:07.610 --> 05:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
I'm speculating to some extent here but
 
05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
I I think that part of the issue was you
 
05:40:12.708 --> 05:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
know there was more
 
05:40:15.470 --> 05:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
more willingness maybe in in earlier
 
05:40:16.970 --> 05:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
times where maybe people were making
 
05:40:18.890 --> 05:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
they were more likely to make their own
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
will without the assistance of an
 
05:40:22.970 --> 05:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
attorney that
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe people somehow people
 
05:40:27.470 --> 05:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
really would be forgetting to mention
 
05:40:29.330 --> 05:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
their children because they're not
 
05:40:31.190 --> 05:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
experts at drafting wills and I didn't
 
05:40:34.010 --> 05:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
think it was all that important and that
 
05:40:35.448 --> 05:40:35.458 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
05:40:38.030 --> 05:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
um but that but which I think is not you
 
05:40:41.270 --> 05:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
know most of I think it's
 
05:40:44.150 --> 05:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
a really rare situation today that a
 
05:40:46.150 --> 05:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
person who makes a will does so without
 
05:40:48.050 --> 05:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
assistance you know some kind of
 
05:40:49.430 --> 05:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
assistance from an attorney or at least
 
05:40:51.650 --> 05:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
doing some kind of you know online
 
05:40:54.170 --> 05:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
research that kind of thing
 
05:40:57.830 --> 05:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's I think uh I think
 
05:40:59.448 --> 05:40:59.458 align:start position:0%
it's probably that historical
 
05:40:59.458 --> 05:41:04.910 align:start position:0%
it's probably that historical
development

05:41:04.910 --> 05:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:08.750 --> 05:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:08.760 --> 05:41:09.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:41:09.708 --> 05:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay that's really helpful because I was
 
05:41:14.510 --> 05:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if if there was any
 
05:41:14.520 --> 05:41:15.230 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if if there was any
um

05:41:15.230 --> 05:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:16.970 --> 05:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
you know I think it used to be practice
 
05:41:20.330 --> 05:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
to leave leave more to the male children
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
than to the female children so I
 
05:41:24.530 --> 05:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
wondered if there was any attempt in the
 
05:41:26.448 --> 05:41:26.458 align:start position:0%
law to
 
05:41:26.458 --> 05:41:27.470 align:start position:0%
law to
um

05:41:27.470 --> 05:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:29.990 --> 05:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
make that naturally more Equitable in
 
05:41:31.368 --> 05:41:31.378 align:start position:0%
terms of how things were left to
 
05:41:33.170 --> 05:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
children but it sounds like that's not
 
05:41:35.810 --> 05:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
the case yeah I you know I mean I don't
 
05:41:37.070 --> 05:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
disagree with you in terms of
 
05:41:39.170 --> 05:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
historically what you know what the
 
05:41:42.830 --> 05:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
practice often was to prefer uh male
 
05:41:42.840 --> 05:41:44.510 align:start position:0%
practice often was to prefer uh male
children

05:41:44.510 --> 05:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:41:47.690 --> 05:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
I don't think that this specifically was
 
05:41:50.090 --> 05:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
was uh you know was addressed to that
 
05:41:51.708 --> 05:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't contain any different
 
05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
the current law doesn't contain any
 
05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
differentiation whether the children are
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:42:03.840 --> 05:42:06.770 align:start position:0%
any other questions
comments

05:42:06.770 --> 05:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:09.288 --> 05:42:09.298 align:start position:0%
I would say that there is
 
05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
a comparable part of the law that
 
05:42:14.868 --> 05:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
provides for spousal share so that
 
05:42:18.770 --> 05:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
spouses cannot be disenfranchised
 
05:42:18.780 --> 05:42:21.050 align:start position:0%
spouses cannot be disenfranchised
and

05:42:21.050 --> 05:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:42:24.470 --> 05:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
and you can't leave all your money to
 
05:42:24.480 --> 05:42:25.550 align:start position:0%
and you can't leave all your money to
your

05:42:25.550 --> 05:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:42:29.868 --> 05:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
mistress right right right now and
 
05:42:31.788 --> 05:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
because it was important as a matter of
 
05:42:34.970 --> 05:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
policy I think at the time that you that
 
05:42:36.410 --> 05:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
we not
 
05:42:39.530 --> 05:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
make spouses Wards of the state and
 
05:42:42.050 --> 05:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
perhaps is comparable in this case that
 
05:42:44.270 --> 05:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't want children to become Wards
 
05:42:46.610 --> 05:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
of the state either but right right
 
05:42:49.128 --> 05:42:49.138 align:start position:0%
although I mean I I don't disagree with
 
05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
you the only thing I would say is that
 
05:42:52.010 --> 05:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
on with remember with regard to spout
 
05:42:53.570 --> 05:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
the one important difference with
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
regards to spouses is
 
05:42:57.890 --> 05:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
with regard to spouses you can't cut
 
05:43:00.170 --> 05:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
them out in other words even you know
 
05:43:02.570 --> 05:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
under under this under even under
 
05:43:05.510 --> 05:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
current law if you say I'm disinheriting
 
05:43:08.330 --> 05:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
my my son or my daughter you can do it
 
05:43:10.610 --> 05:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
you have to specifically say that but
 
05:43:13.128 --> 05:43:13.138 align:start position:0%
you can do it under with a spouse you
 
05:43:15.230 --> 05:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
can't do it you just can't you you can
 
05:43:18.530 --> 05:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
say I'm you know I'm I'm cutting him out
 
05:43:20.330 --> 05:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
or I'm cutting her out but the law
 
05:43:21.830 --> 05:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow you to do that the spouse
 
05:43:24.890 --> 05:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
can elect against the will and get a get
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
the statutory share which is as it
 
05:43:28.670 --> 05:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
should be as far I mean as far as I'm
 
05:43:32.810 --> 05:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:34.368 --> 05:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
05:43:37.310 --> 05:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you I'm just a
 
05:43:39.110 --> 05:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
little confused now because I thought
 
05:43:44.330 --> 05:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
you had said um representative Lynn that
 
05:43:46.970 --> 05:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
that if the all the money was left to
 
05:43:49.670 --> 05:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
the spouse that the child that wasn't
 
05:43:52.128 --> 05:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
named could actually take that
 
05:43:54.230 --> 05:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
did I not hear that correctly no no you
 
05:43:56.628 --> 05:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
you you you did hear me correctly it's
 
05:43:58.250 --> 05:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:43:58.260 --> 05:43:59.448 align:start position:0%
the the
um

05:43:59.448 --> 05:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:02.448 --> 05:44:02.458 align:start position:0%
if the if if let's say a give it to give
 
05:44:04.610 --> 05:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
an example a
 
05:44:08.208 --> 05:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
um a person has a person is married and
 
05:44:09.470 --> 05:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
let's just make to make it easy they
 
05:44:11.090 --> 05:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
have one child who's the child of both
 
05:44:12.590 --> 05:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
of them
 
05:44:15.048 --> 05:44:15.058 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
05:44:17.390 --> 05:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
let's say the husband has a will in
 
05:44:20.330 --> 05:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
which he says I leave everything to my
 
05:44:20.340 --> 05:44:21.288 align:start position:0%
which he says I leave everything to my
wife

05:44:21.288 --> 05:44:21.298 align:start position:0%
wife
 
05:44:25.250 --> 05:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent uh makes no mention of
 
05:44:27.650 --> 05:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
the child doesn't say I'm disinheriting
 
05:44:30.110 --> 05:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
my my son or daughter just makes no
 
05:44:33.850 --> 05:44:33.860 align:start position:0%
mention under the current law the child
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
can't get an intestate share under the
 
05:44:40.730 --> 05:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
will but I think that the distinction I
 
05:44:42.770 --> 05:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
would make is this that in that
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
situation the husband has left
 
05:44:45.240 --> 05:44:46.490 align:start position:0%
situation the husband has left
everything

05:44:46.490 --> 05:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:44:49.730 --> 05:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
to the wife I think what what chairman
 
05:44:52.190 --> 05:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
Gordon was talking about is a different
 
05:44:54.590 --> 05:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
statutory situation suppose in that
 
05:44:54.600 --> 05:44:55.910 align:start position:0%
statutory situation suppose in that
situation

05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:44:55.920 --> 05:44:57.410 align:start position:0%
situation
the

05:44:57.410 --> 05:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:45:00.470 --> 05:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
the same situation husband wife and a
 
05:45:04.788 --> 05:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
child the husband says I'm leaving I'm
 
05:45:08.090 --> 05:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
leaving my entire estate to
 
05:45:10.730 --> 05:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
my girlfriend Mary
 
05:45:13.910 --> 05:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
the wife can say
 
05:45:16.610 --> 05:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
no you're not you're we're you're you
 
05:45:19.548 --> 05:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
know I get a statutory share under under
 
05:45:22.910 --> 05:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
a different statute that's so that that
 
05:45:27.048 --> 05:45:27.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:30.530 --> 05:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:33.048 --> 05:45:33.058 align:start position:0%
yes representative notter thank you Mr
 
05:45:34.850 --> 05:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
chairman it's a comment actually I think
 
05:45:36.530 --> 05:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking this would make a good plot
 
05:45:43.368 --> 05:45:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:46.850 --> 05:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
I think you're right I agree completely
 
05:45:50.030 --> 05:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:52.730 --> 05:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:45:54.230 --> 05:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who'd like to
 
05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:01.490 --> 05:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
seeing no one
 
05:46:04.970 --> 05:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
hearing is closed on House Bill 1448.
 
05:46:07.128 --> 05:46:07.138 align:start position:0%
I'm obviously doing a bad job with
 
05:46:09.410 --> 05:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
regard to timing today
 
05:46:11.448 --> 05:46:11.458 align:start position:0%
but the next hearing is scheduled for
 
05:46:16.430 --> 05:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1042 at 3 o'clock and we'll
 
06:01:00.110 --> 06:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:00.120 --> 06:01:01.690 align:start position:0%
 
because

06:01:01.690 --> 06:01:01.700 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:01:04.730 --> 06:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
call the house Judiciary Committee back
 
06:01:06.288 --> 06:01:06.298 align:start position:0%
to order
 
06:01:10.128 --> 06:01:10.138 align:start position:0%
our next item of business is a hearing
 
06:01:14.990 --> 06:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:17.030 --> 06:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
that is requiring certain Health
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
advisory notices to be provided to
 
06:01:21.170 --> 06:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
renters a vacation or recreational
 
06:01:25.128 --> 06:01:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:25.138 --> 06:01:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:01:27.830 --> 06:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:01:29.030 --> 06:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm just going to announce
 
06:01:31.670 --> 06:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
I have a hearing upstairs and so I'm
 
06:01:34.190 --> 06:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
going to be leaving and I'm going to
 
06:01:36.530 --> 06:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
turn the gavel over to representative
 
06:01:40.730 --> 06:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
green to run the hearing but uh before I
 
06:01:42.890 --> 06:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
do that I'll just call upon this primary
 
06:01:49.910 --> 06:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:53.048 --> 06:01:53.058 align:start position:0%
thank you very much respected colleagues
 
06:01:55.190 --> 06:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
I just want to say after the previous
 
06:01:57.590 --> 06:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
Bill's testimony I'm very reassured that
 
06:02:00.770 --> 06:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
my husband can't disinherit me so it's a
 
06:02:01.810 --> 06:02:01.820 align:start position:0%
good day
 
06:02:04.368 --> 06:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Rosemarie
 
06:02:05.868 --> 06:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
wrong and I'm a representative for
 
06:02:08.330 --> 06:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 21 which encompasses the town
 
06:02:09.650 --> 06:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
of Merrimack
 
06:02:11.930 --> 06:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
before I get into the specifics of this
 
06:02:13.430 --> 06:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill I want to give you some background
 
06:02:16.610 --> 06:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
about what brought it about in the state
 
06:02:18.830 --> 06:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and actually around the
 
06:02:20.930 --> 06:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
world there has been an increased
 
06:02:24.010 --> 06:02:24.020 align:start position:0%
incidence of cyanobacteria blooms
 
06:02:26.448 --> 06:02:26.458 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria are among the oldest
 
06:02:28.788 --> 06:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
living organisms on the earth and they
 
06:02:33.170 --> 06:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
can produce the most lethal poison to
 
06:02:36.288 --> 06:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
humans that's known to man
 
06:02:36.298 --> 06:02:37.628 align:start position:0%
humans that's known to man
um

06:02:37.628 --> 06:02:37.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms occur when water
 
06:02:44.270 --> 06:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
becomes warmer when there's more
 
06:02:47.030 --> 06:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
nutrient loads in water and they
 
06:02:49.190 --> 06:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
overgrow and they form these blooms and
 
06:02:52.250 --> 06:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
they release this very toxic poison
 
06:02:54.590 --> 06:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
we have seen in New Hampshire an
 
06:02:57.590 --> 06:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
increase in the number and severity of
 
06:02:59.270 --> 06:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
blooms over the past several years
 
06:03:02.048 --> 06:03:02.058 align:start position:0%
particularly the last two or three years
 
06:03:04.610 --> 06:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
multiple causes for this in addition to
 
06:03:08.948 --> 06:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:12.650 --> 06:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
runoff disruption of the sediment of the
 
06:03:12.660 --> 06:03:13.548 align:start position:0%
runoff disruption of the sediment of the
lake

06:03:13.548 --> 06:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
lake
 
06:03:15.590 --> 06:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
recently found that this is also a
 
06:03:17.048 --> 06:03:17.058 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire Rivers
 
06:03:20.110 --> 06:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday I introduced a bill House Bill
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
1066 to form a study commission among
 
06:03:26.390 --> 06:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
key stakeholders in the state to develop
 
06:03:29.770 --> 06:03:29.780 align:start position:0%
a strategic management plan to address
 
06:03:32.690 --> 06:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms and the reason they
 
06:03:35.390 --> 06:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
have become such of a serious nature is
 
06:03:38.628 --> 06:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
that when people enjoy our Lakes when
 
06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
they boat they water ski they swim fish
 
06:03:44.510 --> 06:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
and there's a bloom going on they may
 
06:03:46.730 --> 06:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
may or may not be aware of the bloom
 
06:03:49.010 --> 06:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
they can suffer very serious health
 
06:03:49.020 --> 06:03:51.070 align:start position:0%
they can suffer very serious health
consequences

06:03:51.070 --> 06:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
06:03:53.048 --> 06:03:53.058 align:start position:0%
immediate consequences or
 
06:03:56.030 --> 06:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
gastroenteritis skin rashes flu-like
 
06:03:56.040 --> 06:03:56.890 align:start position:0%
gastroenteritis skin rashes flu-like
symptoms

06:03:56.890 --> 06:03:56.900 align:start position:0%
symptoms
 
06:04:00.230 --> 06:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
long term cyanobacteria blooms have been
 
06:04:03.048 --> 06:04:03.058 align:start position:0%
linked to ALS Alzheimer's disease and
 
06:04:05.090 --> 06:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
other neurological diseases
 
06:04:08.930 --> 06:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
in fact uh Dr Elijah stomel from the
 
06:04:11.230 --> 06:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth
 
06:04:15.230 --> 06:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
has been one of the Prime researchers in
 
06:04:16.250 --> 06:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
this area
 
06:04:18.770 --> 06:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
because there was an ALS cluster
 
06:04:21.948 --> 06:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
discovered around the Scoma Lake and he
 
06:04:24.650 --> 06:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
was able to link that to the prevalence
 
06:04:27.708 --> 06:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
of chronic cyanobacteria blooms so it's
 
06:04:31.610 --> 06:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
a serious issue I really hope 1066
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
passes so we can put all the great minds
 
06:04:36.410 --> 06:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
together to really develop how New
 
06:04:38.208 --> 06:04:38.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can address this at a state
 
06:04:38.218 --> 06:04:39.288 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can address this at a state
level

06:04:39.288 --> 06:04:39.298 align:start position:0%
level
 
06:04:41.208 --> 06:04:41.218 align:start position:0%
and the reason one of the reasons this
 
06:04:42.830 --> 06:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
is so important in addition to Public
 
06:04:45.470 --> 06:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
Health is the fact that our Lakes
 
06:04:48.110 --> 06:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
generate billions of dollars of value to
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
the state Lake Winnipesaukee alone has
 
06:04:53.690 --> 06:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
been calculated to bring forth 17
 
06:04:56.930 --> 06:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
billion dollars so we there's a serious
 
06:05:00.470 --> 06:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
economic issue if our Lakes are are not
 
06:05:03.830 --> 06:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
able to be enjoyed by residents and by
 
06:05:06.350 --> 06:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
visitors to the state
 
06:05:06.360 --> 06:05:07.250 align:start position:0%
visitors to the state
um

06:05:07.250 --> 06:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:09.410 --> 06:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
my personal experience which brought
 
06:05:11.030 --> 06:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
this forward is I'm a summer resident of
 
06:05:14.868 --> 06:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
moultonborough and the lake where I have
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
a residence is Lake kanasaka and the
 
06:05:20.570 --> 06:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
past two years we've suffered
 
06:05:24.770 --> 06:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms and most of the
 
06:05:27.170 --> 06:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
people that enjoy our Lake and it's not
 
06:05:30.048 --> 06:05:30.058 align:start position:0%
just like kennesaga are people that are
 
06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh accessing it through private means
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
either they're renting Waterfront or
 
06:05:37.390 --> 06:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
water access
 
06:05:41.930 --> 06:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
rental units they are boating
 
06:05:45.110 --> 06:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
um very a small percentage of the people
 
06:05:47.750 --> 06:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
enjoying our lakes and rivers do so
 
06:05:50.330 --> 06:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
through Public Access they're they're
 
06:05:52.368 --> 06:05:52.378 align:start position:0%
going by private means
 
06:05:54.288 --> 06:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
and what we've experienced the last two
 
06:05:57.350 --> 06:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
years is people will spend
 
06:05:59.270 --> 06:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for a rental
 
06:06:02.448 --> 06:06:02.458 align:start position:0%
property week or two weeks to get there
 
06:06:05.170 --> 06:06:05.180 align:start position:0%
and discover they can't go in the water
 
06:06:09.350 --> 06:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
or they go in the water and a resident
 
06:06:11.810 --> 06:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
who's been aware of the the bloom says
 
06:06:13.788 --> 06:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
don't go in it's dangerous
 
06:06:16.850 --> 06:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
one such family nearly lost their dog
 
06:06:19.070 --> 06:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
became so ill
 
06:06:21.530 --> 06:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
and there's right now in New Hampshire
 
06:06:24.610 --> 06:06:24.620 align:start position:0%
there's no way for those people to know
 
06:06:29.090 --> 06:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
that there may be a risk in accessing
 
06:06:31.490 --> 06:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lakes and and other water
 
06:06:33.650 --> 06:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
bodies so
 
06:06:36.230 --> 06:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
we've also seen an issue where when
 
06:06:38.390 --> 06:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
people do have the expectation of
 
06:06:40.548 --> 06:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
enjoying water New Hampshire lakes or
 
06:06:43.548 --> 06:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
Rivers when they rent waterfront
 
06:06:44.930 --> 06:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
property and they have that expectation
 
06:06:46.930 --> 06:06:46.940 align:start position:0%
of going in the water when they don't
 
06:06:49.788 --> 06:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
they expect some kind of remuneration
 
06:06:52.788 --> 06:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
from whoever rented them the property so
 
06:06:54.530 --> 06:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
we've seen at least in moultonborough
 
06:06:58.368 --> 06:06:58.378 align:start position:0%
Conflict exists because the rental
 
06:07:01.390 --> 06:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
agency or the property owner
 
06:07:05.948 --> 06:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
is expected to refund or give some
 
06:07:09.470 --> 06:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
compensation to the renter
 
06:07:11.750 --> 06:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
and yet the renter doesn't know that
 
06:07:14.868 --> 06:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
there is a risk of using that water so
 
06:07:16.910 --> 06:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:07:23.110 --> 06:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
is intended to provide just an informed
 
06:07:25.730 --> 06:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
statement to both the renter and the
 
06:07:29.448 --> 06:07:29.458 align:start position:0%
property owner by saying that if you uh
 
06:07:31.788 --> 06:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
you know if your rent and you typically
 
06:07:34.250 --> 06:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's for any vacation or waterfront
 
06:07:37.670 --> 06:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
property or water access property that
 
06:07:40.970 --> 06:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
there does exist there could be a chance
 
06:07:45.590 --> 06:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
of uh a cyanobacteria or even fecal
 
06:07:45.600 --> 06:07:46.810 align:start position:0%
of uh a cyanobacteria or even fecal
coliform

06:07:46.810 --> 06:07:46.820 align:start position:0%
coliform
 
06:07:49.730 --> 06:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
advisories on that water body and to
 
06:07:53.750 --> 06:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
refer to a website that's on the New
 
06:07:55.270 --> 06:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Des
 
06:07:59.330 --> 06:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
website that lists these advisories so
 
06:08:01.788 --> 06:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
it's really just so that the renter is
 
06:08:04.730 --> 06:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
informed that this risk may occur and
 
06:08:07.010 --> 06:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
that it protects the property manager or
 
06:08:11.390 --> 06:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
the property owner in uh in in providing
 
06:08:14.090 --> 06:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
this informed communicate risk
 
06:08:16.070 --> 06:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
communication to them
 
06:08:18.890 --> 06:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
so um I'd be happy to entertain any
 
06:08:21.110 --> 06:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
questions you have
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
I was over here with a representative
 
06:08:23.760 --> 06:08:25.850 align:start position:0%
I was over here with a representative
page

06:08:25.850 --> 06:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
page
 
06:08:27.530 --> 06:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
06:08:27.540 --> 06:08:28.368 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

06:08:28.368 --> 06:08:28.378 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:08:30.890 --> 06:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
and for your testimony I just have a is
 
06:08:32.030 --> 06:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
06:08:35.628 --> 06:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
to give the potential renter notice
 
06:08:38.570 --> 06:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
prior to agreeing to engage in the
 
06:08:42.948 --> 06:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
rental agreement or once they agree then
 
06:08:46.128 --> 06:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
the notice issues if you follow my
 
06:08:48.110 --> 06:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
questions I've given my deposit I've
 
06:08:50.090 --> 06:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
signed it and then by the way here's
 
06:08:52.610 --> 06:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
here's the notice it would be about that
 
06:08:54.830 --> 06:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
when before the person enters into the
 
06:08:56.510 --> 06:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
agreement or before they sign an
 
06:08:59.270 --> 06:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
agreement their understanding and I
 
06:09:02.270 --> 06:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
think I have the language here that
 
06:09:02.280 --> 06:09:03.708 align:start position:0%
think I have the language here that
um

06:09:03.708 --> 06:09:03.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:03.718 --> 06:09:06.830 align:start position:0%
um
uh

06:09:06.830 --> 06:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
um that fecal bacteria cyanobacteria
 
06:09:12.288 --> 06:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
accounts may may exist so it's to give
 
06:09:14.410 --> 06:09:14.420 align:start position:0%
them notice that this risk does occur
 
06:09:16.910 --> 06:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't assume you can go into the water
 
06:09:19.070 --> 06:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
body from the property that you're
 
06:09:19.080 --> 06:09:20.750 align:start position:0%
body from the property that you're
renting

06:09:20.750 --> 06:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
renting
 
06:09:23.628 --> 06:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
um you know I I really this is to
 
06:09:25.548 --> 06:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
address an immediate problem that we're
 
06:09:27.288 --> 06:09:27.298 align:start position:0%
faced with at the Lakes Region I'm
 
06:09:29.750 --> 06:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
hoping that with more study this
 
06:09:33.230 --> 06:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
commission might develop may add on to
 
06:09:35.750 --> 06:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
this or develop a more comprehensive
 
06:09:38.030 --> 06:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
communication strategy for alerting
 
06:09:40.850 --> 06:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
people to these to the dangers
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
just to follow up for me sure my only
 
06:09:45.230 --> 06:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
and the reason I asked that question is
 
06:09:46.430 --> 06:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:09:48.708 --> 06:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
the notice issues at the time that the
 
06:09:51.830 --> 06:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
rental agreement is agreed upon so I
 
06:09:54.470 --> 06:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
wondered in my mind couldn't what did
 
06:09:57.288 --> 06:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
that mean in terms of we've agreed to
 
06:09:59.990 --> 06:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
agreed upon do you see what I'm what I'm
 
06:10:01.368 --> 06:10:01.378 align:start position:0%
saying yeah
 
06:10:03.530 --> 06:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
06:10:06.410 --> 06:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
um I correlate it to on a rental
 
06:10:09.048 --> 06:10:09.058 align:start position:0%
agreement it might say the balance of
 
06:10:12.470 --> 06:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
your payment is due within 14 days of
 
06:10:16.368 --> 06:10:16.378 align:start position:0%
occupation or a late payment would incur
 
06:10:19.730 --> 06:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
five percent interest rate or penalty so
 
06:10:22.368 --> 06:10:22.378 align:start position:0%
rental agreements have disclaimers on
 
06:10:25.368 --> 06:10:25.378 align:start position:0%
them already to alert the renter of
 
06:10:27.530 --> 06:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
conditions of that agreement so this
 
06:10:30.048 --> 06:10:30.058 align:start position:0%
would be it wouldn't be a condition of
 
06:10:35.208 --> 06:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:38.270 --> 06:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
so in the event a renter
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
is at that property it's experiencing a
 
06:10:43.570 --> 06:10:43.580 align:start position:0%
bloom they can't go into the water
 
06:10:46.548 --> 06:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
if they go back to the property manager
 
06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
and make demands for a refund or or
 
06:10:53.208 --> 06:10:53.218 align:start position:0%
they're protesting the property manager
 
06:10:54.708 --> 06:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
could be in a position say you were
 
06:10:57.770 --> 06:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
warned that this could exist
 
06:11:01.430 --> 06:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative Sylvia had a
 
06:11:01.440 --> 06:11:02.510 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative Sylvia had a
question

06:11:02.510 --> 06:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:11:04.250 --> 06:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:11:05.868 --> 06:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:11:05.878 --> 06:11:07.490 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:11:07.490 --> 06:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:10.850 --> 06:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this may
 
06:11:10.860 --> 06:11:11.510 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this may
um

06:11:11.510 --> 06:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:14.690 --> 06:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
somewhat advertise
 
06:11:17.510 --> 06:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as not being a safe place
 
06:11:19.788 --> 06:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
to come and visit that's certainly not
 
06:11:22.190 --> 06:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
your intention is it no no absolutely
 
06:11:24.530 --> 06:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
not in fact many other states are going
 
06:11:27.110 --> 06:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
through this Florida for one state is
 
06:11:29.330 --> 06:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
experiencing very serious cyanobacterial
 
06:11:32.628 --> 06:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
blooms so it's not to advertise that
 
06:11:36.288 --> 06:11:36.298 align:start position:0%
it's really just to notify a renter that
 
06:11:38.570 --> 06:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
there is a risk that these blooms may
 
06:11:42.048 --> 06:11:42.058 align:start position:0%
occur it would also apply to Renters of
 
06:11:44.930 --> 06:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
Seacoast properties I know that Hampton
 
06:11:47.690 --> 06:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
Beach Northampton experienced several
 
06:11:50.410 --> 06:11:50.420 align:start position:0%
fecal coliform
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
advisories over the summer
 
06:11:57.048 --> 06:11:57.058 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you um
 
06:12:01.868 --> 06:12:01.878 align:start position:0%
so these issues with water quality
 
06:12:04.730 --> 06:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
are passing things generally in the
 
06:12:07.368 --> 06:12:07.378 align:start position:0%
summer I would think how long a period
 
06:12:09.670 --> 06:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
of time are these
 
06:12:13.250 --> 06:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
affecting water bodies it
 
06:12:16.970 --> 06:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
generally most of the cyanobacteria
 
06:12:18.948 --> 06:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
blooms I can't speak for fecal coliform
 
06:12:22.490 --> 06:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
contamination but cyanobacteri blooms
 
06:12:25.610 --> 06:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
generally occur in late summer fall they
 
06:12:27.110 --> 06:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
can actually last through the winter
 
06:12:30.170 --> 06:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
they can exist under ice
 
06:12:31.610 --> 06:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so it's
 
06:12:33.410 --> 06:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
it but it's usually when people really
 
06:12:35.510 --> 06:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
want to go in the water when it's a hot
 
06:12:35.520 --> 06:12:36.830 align:start position:0%
want to go in the water when it's a hot
day

06:12:36.830 --> 06:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:12:39.890 --> 06:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
um and it's been dry they they want to
 
06:12:41.750 --> 06:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
go in the water and that's usually those
 
06:12:44.510 --> 06:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
that conditions that trigger a bloom to
 
06:12:44.520 --> 06:12:46.250 align:start position:0%
that conditions that trigger a bloom to
occur

06:12:46.250 --> 06:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
occur
 
06:12:48.430 --> 06:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up
 
06:12:50.690 --> 06:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:12:52.910 --> 06:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
as I read this I see it's it's not
 
06:12:54.948 --> 06:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
06:12:54.958 --> 06:12:55.850 align:start position:0%
limited to
um

06:12:55.850 --> 06:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:57.948 --> 06:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
places where they're near a body of
 
06:13:01.030 --> 06:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
waters this is for every vacation rental
 
06:13:05.150 --> 06:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
actually I I want it to go into rental
 
06:13:07.610 --> 06:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
agreement particularly for those rental
 
06:13:10.190 --> 06:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
agreements for a vacation or
 
06:13:12.650 --> 06:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
recreational rental unit because that's
 
06:13:14.750 --> 06:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
where the expectation lies that they
 
06:13:16.250 --> 06:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
would be able they would be going into
 
06:13:16.260 --> 06:13:18.650 align:start position:0%
would be able they would be going into
water

06:13:18.650 --> 06:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:20.930 --> 06:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah okay
 
06:13:22.368 --> 06:13:22.378 align:start position:0%
oh and another question over here
 
06:13:25.810 --> 06:13:25.820 align:start position:0%
representative Chase yes seconds
 
06:13:28.150 --> 06:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
06:13:30.048 --> 06:13:30.058 align:start position:0%
representative Ryan if you're taking my
 
06:13:33.590 --> 06:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
question you're saying Bloom I think the
 
06:13:36.048 --> 06:13:36.058 align:start position:0%
word so I'm looking it up oh there it is
 
06:13:38.448 --> 06:13:38.458 align:start position:0%
but um so is this something that you can
 
06:13:40.730 --> 06:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
actually see in the water does it Bloom
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
is it a foamy thing or or is it just
 
06:13:47.628 --> 06:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
like a red tide when it's a high risk of
 
06:13:52.070 --> 06:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
um it it's uh it can vary generally most
 
06:13:55.010 --> 06:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
blooms I would say maybe
 
06:13:59.510 --> 06:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
60 of them look like a green uh slime on
 
06:14:00.890 --> 06:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
the surface it looks as if somebody's
 
06:14:03.470 --> 06:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
poured green paint that's floating and
 
06:14:05.690 --> 06:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
it usually will congregate around ashore
 
06:14:09.350 --> 06:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
they can't travel through the lake but
 
06:14:11.570 --> 06:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
there can one of the most dangerous
 
06:14:14.090 --> 06:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
blooms just looks like sugar crystals
 
06:14:16.310 --> 06:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
kind of floating in the
 
06:14:18.230 --> 06:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's sort of just under the surface
 
06:14:21.170 --> 06:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
almost might look like a little Cloud
 
06:14:25.070 --> 06:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and then and usually all blooms but
 
06:14:27.708 --> 06:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
not all will have like a little streaky
 
06:14:30.708 --> 06:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
and it all depends on the number of
 
06:14:32.628 --> 06:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
cells per
 
06:14:35.470 --> 06:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
um I guess it's Mill cells per ml
 
06:14:39.410 --> 06:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire Des issues red
 
06:14:41.690 --> 06:14:41.700 align:start position:0%
advisories that means they wreck they
 
06:14:43.490 --> 06:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
can't forbid anybody from going in water
 
06:14:45.948 --> 06:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
but they can put advisories like it's
 
06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous to go in the water and they
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
usually do that when it's at 70
 
06:14:55.548 --> 06:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:58.368 --> 06:14:58.378 align:start position:0%
all right are there any other questions
 
06:15:01.310 --> 06:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative Delorenzo
 
06:15:04.368 --> 06:15:04.378 align:start position:0%
thank you missed it here
 
06:15:07.490 --> 06:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
a question representative mom
 
06:15:09.470 --> 06:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about
 
06:15:09.480 --> 06:15:10.730 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about
something

06:15:10.730 --> 06:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:15:14.270 --> 06:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
a condition that's an inherent danger
 
06:15:17.030 --> 06:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
um caused by nature and we talked about
 
06:15:19.970 --> 06:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
sort of like North Country properties on
 
06:15:23.390 --> 06:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
lakes and we talked a little bit about
 
06:15:26.628 --> 06:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
um Seaside properties so
 
06:15:29.330 --> 06:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
on the same note what you need to put we
 
06:15:31.788 --> 06:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
would have rent with a landlord or a
 
06:15:34.310 --> 06:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
property manager need to send a renter
 
06:15:37.430 --> 06:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
on a Seacoast property I noticed that
 
06:15:40.250 --> 06:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
there are sharks in the water
 
06:15:44.510 --> 06:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
no I I I don't really think it's wise to
 
06:15:46.670 --> 06:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
put responsibility on the property
 
06:15:48.890 --> 06:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
manager or property owner to notify
 
06:15:52.208 --> 06:15:52.218 align:start position:0%
someone of an active bloom or advisory
 
06:15:55.368 --> 06:15:55.378 align:start position:0%
and the reason for this is there needs
 
06:15:58.310 --> 06:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of work done on the behalf
 
06:16:01.128 --> 06:16:01.138 align:start position:0%
of on on the part of the state to really
 
06:16:03.350 --> 06:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
develop a comprehensive strategy on this
 
06:16:06.530 --> 06:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
because even they can't identify all the
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
blooms last year there were 30
 
06:16:13.628 --> 06:16:13.638 align:start position:0%
advisories issued and I would estimate
 
06:16:16.730 --> 06:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
that the actual number of looms probably
 
06:16:19.190 --> 06:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
were 10 times that because those
 
06:16:21.110 --> 06:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
advisories were only issued when someone
 
06:16:24.170 --> 06:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
called in to Des when Des took a sample
 
06:16:27.650 --> 06:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
and tested a sample and blooms can be
 
06:16:30.170 --> 06:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
very transitory there could be blooms
 
06:16:32.090 --> 06:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
that last for a few days some for a few
 
06:16:32.100 --> 06:16:33.650 align:start position:0%
that last for a few days some for a few
months

06:16:33.650 --> 06:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
months
 
06:16:36.288 --> 06:16:36.298 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of one bloom that lasted from
 
06:16:39.350 --> 06:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
August into November same thing with
 
06:16:42.410 --> 06:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
fecal coliform many times it's dependent
 
06:16:44.990 --> 06:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
on weather you may not see that until
 
06:16:47.930 --> 06:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
after let's say a rainstorm where let's
 
06:16:51.770 --> 06:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
say there might be runoff or animal
 
06:16:54.590 --> 06:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
waste that travels into a water body
 
06:16:56.810 --> 06:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
that may cause the fecal coliform
 
06:16:56.820 --> 06:16:58.150 align:start position:0%
that may cause the fecal coliform
advisory

06:16:58.150 --> 06:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
06:17:01.730 --> 06:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
and it's really difficult to say how
 
06:17:03.410 --> 06:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
long that's going to happen and in a
 
06:17:05.570 --> 06:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
lake too sometimes you can have a bloom
 
06:17:09.110 --> 06:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
on the west end but depending on the
 
06:17:11.750 --> 06:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
leeward side it could you know it could
 
06:17:14.570 --> 06:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
appear there in the in a few hours so I
 
06:17:16.850 --> 06:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
think as long as people are aware that
 
06:17:20.150 --> 06:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
these things can they may not but they
 
06:17:23.288 --> 06:17:23.298 align:start position:0%
can occur and it would prevent you from
 
06:17:27.410 --> 06:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
from accessing that water which you've
 
06:17:29.030 --> 06:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
had this expectation that you're going
 
06:17:30.410 --> 06:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
to do if you've rented in if you're
 
06:17:32.868 --> 06:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
renting that type of property
 
06:17:34.730 --> 06:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know I hope I answered your
 
06:17:37.190 --> 06:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you very much thank
 
06:17:39.350 --> 06:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
you all right are there any more
 
06:17:41.330 --> 06:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee okay uh
 
06:17:49.610 --> 06:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:51.530 --> 06:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
you they Coast I know when we can go in
 
06:17:53.510 --> 06:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
the water and when we can't is this
 
06:17:55.368 --> 06:17:55.378 align:start position:0%
something though that maybe Lakeside or
 
06:17:57.890 --> 06:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
the state should be doing versus it
 
06:18:00.350 --> 06:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
being the actual renter
 
06:18:02.510 --> 06:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
um landlord
 
06:18:05.690 --> 06:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
um I I think we need to get we need to
 
06:18:07.310 --> 06:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
learn more about this we need to learn
 
06:18:09.610 --> 06:18:09.620 align:start position:0%
the most effective ways of communication
 
06:18:15.530 --> 06:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
and that is my hope if 1066 passes and
 
06:18:19.208 --> 06:18:19.218 align:start position:0%
we get the HHS the veterinary Society
 
06:18:21.770 --> 06:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
just a lot of these people together to
 
06:18:23.390 --> 06:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
determine what's the most effective way
 
06:18:26.990 --> 06:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
it could be a nixel alert but the danger
 
06:18:28.910 --> 06:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
is increasing every year from these
 
06:18:30.708 --> 06:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
blooms and people don't know anything
 
06:18:32.628 --> 06:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
about them
 
06:18:36.650 --> 06:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
um and so this is essentially just
 
06:18:39.530 --> 06:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
something to address what we've seen in
 
06:18:42.230 --> 06:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
The Lakes Region specifically in in
 
06:18:44.990 --> 06:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
Meredith and in moultonborough That's
 
06:18:47.150 --> 06:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
where I've seen experience where there
 
06:18:49.970 --> 06:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
has just been very contentious
 
06:18:52.490 --> 06:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
disagreement between people very angry
 
06:18:52.500 --> 06:18:53.990 align:start position:0%
disagreement between people very angry
people

06:18:53.990 --> 06:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:18:55.490 --> 06:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
um because they have this expectation
 
06:18:57.048 --> 06:18:57.058 align:start position:0%
that they can enjoy the lake and then
 
06:19:00.708 --> 06:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:05.750 --> 06:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:07.368 --> 06:19:07.378 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else in the room who
 
06:19:09.650 --> 06:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
would wish oh I'm sorry
 
06:19:11.690 --> 06:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
representative welper
 
06:19:13.490 --> 06:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:19:15.650 --> 06:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh my question is to
 
06:19:18.170 --> 06:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
do with the written agreement part of
 
06:19:18.180 --> 06:19:19.610 align:start position:0%
do with the written agreement part of
this

06:19:19.610 --> 06:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:19:21.288 --> 06:19:21.298 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the rental that goes on in
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
our state I don't even know how it
 
06:19:23.280 --> 06:19:24.410 align:start position:0%
our state I don't even know how it
happens

06:19:24.410 --> 06:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
happens
 
06:19:27.048 --> 06:19:27.058 align:start position:0%
all I know is uh for example I was at I
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
have a timeshare
 
06:19:30.410 --> 06:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
and people just
 
06:19:32.690 --> 06:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
booked a timeshare through some agent
 
06:19:34.910 --> 06:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
that we don't even know while we do know
 
06:19:37.310 --> 06:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
who it is but we don't know in this
 
06:19:39.350 --> 06:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
sentence being a person or anything
 
06:19:39.360 --> 06:19:40.970 align:start position:0%
sentence being a person or anything
and

06:19:40.970 --> 06:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:19:43.070 --> 06:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
so are you saying everybody that comes
 
06:19:45.230 --> 06:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
into our units we would have to hand
 
06:19:46.850 --> 06:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
them a piece of paper that says are you
 
06:19:48.410 --> 06:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
aware of this
 
06:19:51.770 --> 06:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
well I think but they've already paid
 
06:19:54.048 --> 06:19:54.058 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be at that time of
 
06:19:56.570 --> 06:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
agreement when there is a when there is
 
06:19:58.610 --> 06:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
a formal agreement that would be legally
 
06:20:01.610 --> 06:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
enforceable that there would be notice
 
06:20:04.910 --> 06:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
and I uh you know of that this this risk
 
06:20:08.390 --> 06:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
could occur same it I I use the example
 
06:20:12.410 --> 06:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
if a renter is informed that if they
 
06:20:14.410 --> 06:20:14.420 align:start position:0%
don't pay the balance of their agreement
 
06:20:17.570 --> 06:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
by date of occupancy there may be a
 
06:20:20.208 --> 06:20:20.218 align:start position:0%
penalty I mean we we there are a lot of
 
06:20:22.610 --> 06:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
disclaimers in these types of agreements
 
06:20:24.948 --> 06:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
this would would necessarily be a
 
06:20:27.110 --> 06:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
disclaimer it's just a notice but it
 
06:20:29.090 --> 06:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
would protect the property manager and
 
06:20:30.470 --> 06:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
property owner
 
06:20:34.190 --> 06:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
from a complaint that someone wasn't
 
06:20:36.590 --> 06:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
able to use the property as they had
 
06:20:38.208 --> 06:20:38.218 align:start position:0%
intended when they entered that
 
06:20:41.150 --> 06:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
agreement it would it would be a notice
 
06:20:43.128 --> 06:20:43.138 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:20:45.948 --> 06:20:45.958 align:start position:0%
that's exactly my problem
 
06:20:49.128 --> 06:20:49.138 align:start position:0%
right because the people coming into our
 
06:20:51.170 --> 06:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
units we don't have any agreement with
 
06:20:53.208 --> 06:20:53.218 align:start position:0%
them we have agreement with our owners
 
06:20:55.430 --> 06:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
because they're owners and we don't need
 
06:20:56.810 --> 06:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
an agreement
 
06:20:58.548 --> 06:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
but we don't have any agreement with the
 
06:20:59.868 --> 06:20:59.878 align:start position:0%
people coming in we have an agreement
 
06:21:01.850 --> 06:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
with a rental agency that's out in the
 
06:21:03.530 --> 06:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
East or someplace
 
06:21:05.810 --> 06:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
and I have no idea
 
06:21:08.208 --> 06:21:08.218 align:start position:0%
when they might pay
 
06:21:11.090 --> 06:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
because they don't pay us
 
06:21:13.190 --> 06:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
so when they enter an agreement with
 
06:21:15.110 --> 06:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
someone where they paid so if they've
 
06:21:17.270 --> 06:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
gone on a website and paid
 
06:21:19.548 --> 06:21:19.558 align:start position:0%
they they've had to enter an agreement
 
06:21:23.150 --> 06:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
at that time to like they entered into
 
06:21:25.548 --> 06:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
the agreement maybe years before
 
06:21:27.770 --> 06:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
so I have an agreement that that if I
 
06:21:30.110 --> 06:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
have points with RCI
 
06:21:32.030 --> 06:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
I can trade those points in and go
 
06:21:32.040 --> 06:21:33.288 align:start position:0%
I can trade those points in and go
places

06:21:33.288 --> 06:21:33.298 align:start position:0%
places
 
06:21:36.310 --> 06:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay and that's what I live in Virginia
 
06:21:40.190 --> 06:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
or Indiana or wherever and I said Gee
 
06:21:41.390 --> 06:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice to vacation in New
 
06:21:41.400 --> 06:21:42.230 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice to vacation in New
Hampshire

06:21:42.230 --> 06:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:21:44.810 --> 06:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
so I trade in my points I get a
 
06:21:46.490 --> 06:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
reservation at a time share in New
 
06:21:46.500 --> 06:21:49.010 align:start position:0%
reservation at a time share in New
Hampshire

06:21:49.010 --> 06:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:53.030 --> 06:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's no nothing between me and the
 
06:21:55.310 --> 06:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
and the I don't know how we would handle
 
06:21:55.320 --> 06:21:56.270 align:start position:0%
and the I don't know how we would handle
that

06:21:56.270 --> 06:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:21:56.280 --> 06:21:56.890 align:start position:0%
that
yeah

06:21:56.890 --> 06:21:56.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:22:00.048 --> 06:22:00.058 align:start position:0%
that way and it's a similar circumstance
 
06:22:03.070 --> 06:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
I think with a lot of these gig rents
 
06:22:06.288 --> 06:22:06.298 align:start position:0%
largely legal but going
 
06:22:10.430 --> 06:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
on uh I have no idea no idea what kind
 
06:22:12.048 --> 06:22:12.058 align:start position:0%
of agreement
 
06:22:14.448 --> 06:22:14.458 align:start position:0%
a land if you go through
 
06:22:16.128 --> 06:22:16.138 align:start position:0%
that's my problem is you go through
 
06:22:19.368 --> 06:22:19.378 align:start position:0%
third parties right and there's hardly
 
06:22:21.530 --> 06:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
any interaction between the rent the
 
06:22:21.540 --> 06:22:22.368 align:start position:0%
any interaction between the rent the
owner

06:22:22.368 --> 06:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
owner
 
06:22:24.288 --> 06:22:24.298 align:start position:0%
and the tenant
 
06:22:26.690 --> 06:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
with the exception of allowing them
 
06:22:26.700 --> 06:22:28.430 align:start position:0%
with the exception of allowing them
access

06:22:28.430 --> 06:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
access
 
06:22:31.010 --> 06:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
no I understand it and as I mentioned at
 
06:22:33.048 --> 06:22:33.058 align:start position:0%
the beginning this is really like a stop
 
06:22:35.270 --> 06:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
Gap this is to address an immediate need
 
06:22:37.670 --> 06:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
there are going to be many people that
 
06:22:39.708 --> 06:22:39.718 align:start position:0%
are going to be exposed to this risk
 
06:22:42.350 --> 06:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
that have no knowledge of it
 
06:22:44.270 --> 06:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
um for instance if somebody
 
06:22:44.280 --> 06:22:45.010 align:start position:0%
um for instance if somebody
um

06:22:45.010 --> 06:22:45.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:49.010 --> 06:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
loans their Cottage to a family friend
 
06:22:50.270 --> 06:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
um they're good they're not gonna
 
06:22:51.948 --> 06:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be aware of this
 
06:22:55.250 --> 06:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
risk and whatever outcomes that they
 
06:22:56.810 --> 06:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
experience if there happens to be a
 
06:22:58.430 --> 06:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
bloom at that time that's going to
 
06:23:00.410 --> 06:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
happen but this will protect some
 
06:23:02.750 --> 06:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
property managers and it will inform
 
06:23:07.010 --> 06:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
some Renters of the risk and that that
 
06:23:10.310 --> 06:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
the entitlement to use water a water
 
06:23:14.270 --> 06:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
body through a rental agreement isn't
 
06:23:17.030 --> 06:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't exist you you don't you
 
06:23:19.010 --> 06:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
can you you're not entitled when you
 
06:23:20.570 --> 06:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
enter an agreement to use someone's
 
06:23:23.810 --> 06:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
property that the water is going to be
 
06:23:28.070 --> 06:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
safe it all depends on mother nature and
 
06:23:30.048 --> 06:23:30.058 align:start position:0%
um so this is just informing them yeah
 
06:23:32.390 --> 06:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
you're renting waterfront property but
 
06:23:34.788 --> 06:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
there may be a chance that the water
 
06:23:37.730 --> 06:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
isn't safe for you to go into
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
last one yeah one more follow-up
 
06:23:43.610 --> 06:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
so uh along the lines of the inherent
 
06:23:44.810 --> 06:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
risk of
 
06:23:47.750 --> 06:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
fill in the blank nature
 
06:23:50.628 --> 06:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
was was used before we've had many bills
 
06:23:51.830 --> 06:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
before us
 
06:23:53.330 --> 06:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
they were looking for protections
 
06:23:56.390 --> 06:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
against these inherent risks
 
06:23:56.400 --> 06:23:57.708 align:start position:0%
against these inherent risks
and

06:23:57.708 --> 06:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:24:01.250 --> 06:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
we haven't been very amenable to that no
 
06:24:03.230 --> 06:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
this isn't giving anyone any protection
 
06:24:06.650 --> 06:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's just alerting people to this issue
 
06:24:09.948 --> 06:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
I mean I've talked about cyanobacteria
 
06:24:11.330 --> 06:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
with many colleagues who've never heard
 
06:24:13.128 --> 06:24:13.138 align:start position:0%
of it before and they certainly didn't
 
06:24:15.110 --> 06:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
hear of its links to ALS and
 
06:24:16.850 --> 06:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
neurological diseases
 
06:24:20.030 --> 06:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
so if my colleagues aren't aware of it I
 
06:24:21.890 --> 06:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
think it's safe to assume there's other
 
06:24:24.170 --> 06:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
people that aren't aware of it that are
 
06:24:26.090 --> 06:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
coming into our state or within our
 
06:24:29.208 --> 06:24:29.218 align:start position:0%
state and and renting waterfront
 
06:24:32.150 --> 06:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
property with the expectation of using
 
06:24:34.430 --> 06:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
that Waterfront and this is just a way
 
06:24:37.010 --> 06:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
of informing them that there could be
 
06:24:40.970 --> 06:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
this risk and there and and also ways
 
06:24:43.850 --> 06:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
where they can find out if there is a
 
06:24:46.610 --> 06:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
documented advisory on that water body
 
06:24:49.670 --> 06:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
it does direct them to the site but most
 
06:24:52.730 --> 06:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
people going into renting waterfront
 
06:24:54.170 --> 06:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
property don't just say oh I think I'll
 
06:24:57.470 --> 06:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
go to nhdes and see what advisories are
 
06:24:59.390 --> 06:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
most people don't even know that site
 
06:25:02.390 --> 06:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
exists so this is a it's a communication
 
06:25:05.810 --> 06:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
tool just to give people information
 
06:25:09.890 --> 06:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
that they can make a a decision on
 
06:25:11.208 --> 06:25:11.218 align:start position:0%
whether they want to expose themselves
 
06:25:16.610 --> 06:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:20.750 --> 06:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah you got a question yes proceed
 
06:25:21.890 --> 06:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:25:23.150 --> 06:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question it's very simple
 
06:25:25.490 --> 06:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
is the advisory is the only way people
 
06:25:27.170 --> 06:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
find out through that website or Is
 
06:25:28.850 --> 06:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
there any other mode that it's
 
06:25:28.860 --> 06:25:30.530 align:start position:0%
there any other mode that it's
communicated

06:25:30.530 --> 06:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
communicated
 
06:25:33.048 --> 06:25:33.058 align:start position:0%
um the way the advisories work is once
 
06:25:35.390 --> 06:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
Des has been alerted
 
06:25:37.850 --> 06:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
um that there is a suspected Bloom they
 
06:25:39.708 --> 06:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
will gather a sample or have someone
 
06:25:41.570 --> 06:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
deliver a sample to their labs in
 
06:25:45.410 --> 06:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
Concord and when they confirm and they
 
06:25:48.830 --> 06:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
confirm the level of of cells they will
 
06:25:52.368 --> 06:25:52.378 align:start position:0%
put on their website an advisory that
 
06:25:55.548 --> 06:25:55.558 align:start position:0%
there is a cyanobacteria bloom
 
06:25:58.190 --> 06:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
there are Lake Associations that can
 
06:26:01.788 --> 06:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
take it upon themselves to post a sign
 
06:26:04.610 --> 06:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
um on nearby roads alerting people but
 
06:26:07.368 --> 06:26:07.378 align:start position:0%
it's a sign that comes from the state it
 
06:26:08.868 --> 06:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
it's you can't read it when you're
 
06:26:11.208 --> 06:26:11.218 align:start position:0%
driving down it's a small print
 
06:26:13.788 --> 06:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
they will if if the bloom is occurring
 
06:26:15.890 --> 06:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
on a public beach and I'll use Silver
 
06:26:18.770 --> 06:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
Lake in Hollis as an example they will
 
06:26:21.170 --> 06:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
post the advisory on the beach
 
06:26:23.510 --> 06:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
which makes it much more easy to read
 
06:26:27.890 --> 06:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
and the the same process is is uh it
 
06:26:31.730 --> 06:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
happens when there's a call A coliform E
 
06:26:35.810 --> 06:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:38.510 --> 06:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up do they only check the water
 
06:26:41.150 --> 06:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
when it's reported or is there like a
 
06:26:43.128 --> 06:26:43.138 align:start position:0%
time frame where where they'll go out of
 
06:26:45.170 --> 06:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
their way to check for these blooms they
 
06:26:47.270 --> 06:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
they really only test it when they're
 
06:26:49.250 --> 06:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
told because there's only one person in
 
06:26:51.530 --> 06:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
the state that runs the program and
 
06:26:54.048 --> 06:26:54.058 align:start position:0%
she's actually just resigned she's taken
 
06:26:56.750 --> 06:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
a position at UNH so
 
06:26:59.208 --> 06:26:59.218 align:start position:0%
um David Niels who's the Fisheries
 
06:27:02.030 --> 06:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
biologist for Des he testified in
 
06:27:05.690 --> 06:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
support of 1066 and he recognizes this
 
06:27:07.548 --> 06:27:07.558 align:start position:0%
is a huge hole people just don't know
 
06:27:09.350 --> 06:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
about this they can't
 
06:27:11.930 --> 06:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
it's uh they just they just can't go to
 
06:27:14.810 --> 06:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
Every there's a but a thousand lakes in
 
06:27:17.090 --> 06:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they can't monitor every
 
06:27:19.850 --> 06:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
one of them occasionally you might there
 
06:27:21.470 --> 06:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
might be someone from fish and game that
 
06:27:23.750 --> 06:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
notices a bloom and like I said there
 
06:27:26.448 --> 06:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
could be a bloom one day and it's gone
 
06:27:28.128 --> 06:27:28.138 align:start position:0%
the next
 
06:27:31.850 --> 06:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
um but that one day when there's a bloom
 
06:27:34.310 --> 06:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
um if a dog's in the water the dog will
 
06:27:37.010 --> 06:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
get really sick and and I know of people
 
06:27:39.830 --> 06:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
whose dogs have died going into blooms
 
06:27:43.490 --> 06:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
so young children go in it's and people
 
06:27:45.288 --> 06:27:45.298 align:start position:0%
just have no
 
06:27:46.850 --> 06:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
um they just don't have any awareness
 
06:27:48.948 --> 06:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
that this is a this is a risk and like I
 
06:27:51.530 --> 06:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
said some blooms don't have that green
 
06:27:53.690 --> 06:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look the water doesn't look
 
06:27:53.700 --> 06:27:54.708 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look the water doesn't look
bad

06:27:54.708 --> 06:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
bad
 
06:27:57.170 --> 06:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
it may look a little cloudy
 
06:27:59.090 --> 06:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
but when people are vacation they just
 
06:28:00.410 --> 06:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
want to go in the water
 
06:28:03.948 --> 06:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:06.350 --> 06:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:28:08.990 --> 06:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
any more questions no more questions
 
06:28:11.090 --> 06:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
06:28:13.128 --> 06:28:13.138 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the room who would like
 
06:28:15.470 --> 06:28:15.480 align:start position:0%

06:28:19.670 --> 06:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:23.390 --> 06:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:24.708 --> 06:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
you got something like that for the next
 
06:28:24.718 --> 06:28:27.170 align:start position:0%
you got something like that for the next
bill

06:28:27.170 --> 06:28:27.180 align:start position:0%

this exemption
 
06:45:55.730 --> 06:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
makes them non-public records
 
06:45:58.850 --> 06:45:58.860 align:start position:0%

06:46:25.730 --> 06:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
the attorney-client privileging is kind
 
06:46:27.048 --> 06:46:27.058 align:start position:0%
of interesting
 
06:46:27.058 --> 06:46:28.610 align:start position:0%
of interesting
because

06:46:28.610 --> 06:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:46:30.230 --> 06:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
in the very beginning of the right to
 
06:46:31.788 --> 06:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
know Act
 
06:46:33.708 --> 06:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
well let me stop
 
06:46:35.090 --> 06:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
start over
 
06:46:37.368 --> 06:46:37.378 align:start position:0%
the right to know Act is about openness
 
06:46:40.070 --> 06:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
and transparency in government it's
 
06:46:44.030 --> 06:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
about the citizens right to know what
 
06:46:45.830 --> 06:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
the government is doing
 
06:46:49.128 --> 06:46:49.138 align:start position:0%
and how it's doing it
 
06:46:52.128 --> 06:46:52.138 align:start position:0%
but in the beginning of that act it
 
06:46:54.830 --> 06:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
describes what's a meeting
 
06:46:57.410 --> 06:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that's totally
 
06:46:57.420 --> 06:46:59.030 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that's totally
excluded

06:46:59.030 --> 06:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
06:47:01.850 --> 06:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
is attorney-client consultation
 
06:47:04.250 --> 06:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
so if anybody any public body wants to
 
06:47:05.990 --> 06:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
consult with their attorney they can do
 
06:47:08.090 --> 06:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
so anytime they want and it's not
 
06:47:10.368 --> 06:47:10.378 align:start position:0%
subject to the right to know Act without
 
06:47:12.530 --> 06:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
this exemption
 
06:47:16.190 --> 06:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
because it's already existing law
 
06:47:18.468 --> 06:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
in addition to that if they want to get
 
06:47:22.070 --> 06:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
advice or look at work attorney work
 
06:47:25.490 --> 06:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
product documents they can do that in
 
06:47:27.170 --> 06:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
non-public session under another
 
06:47:30.890 --> 06:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
exemption or or exception within the
 
06:47:33.530 --> 06:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
right to know Act
 
06:47:37.070 --> 06:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
so my question is why in the world will
 
06:47:39.530 --> 06:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
we ever add something that said nothing
 
06:47:42.110 --> 06:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's ever done by an attorney becomes
 
06:47:43.610 --> 06:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
a public document
 
06:47:45.530 --> 06:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't do that
 
06:47:48.170 --> 06:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
we didn't do that in this house
 
06:47:50.150 --> 06:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
except that it was forced Upon Us during
 
06:47:51.530 --> 06:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference at the end
 
06:47:53.448 --> 06:47:53.458 align:start position:0%
of last year we never had a public
 
06:47:55.430 --> 06:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on this idea
 
06:47:57.410 --> 06:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
we never never talked about that in this
 
06:47:57.420 --> 06:47:59.270 align:start position:0%
we never never talked about that in this
committee

06:47:59.270 --> 06:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:48:02.448 --> 06:48:02.458 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't an issue and it wasn't
 
06:48:05.690 --> 06:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
an issue because as was presented to me
 
06:48:07.968 --> 06:48:07.978 align:start position:0%
during that
 
06:48:10.250 --> 06:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference it was existing
 
06:48:10.260 --> 06:48:11.690 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference it was existing
law

06:48:11.690 --> 06:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:48:14.448 --> 06:48:14.458 align:start position:0%
except it wasn't existing law the
 
06:48:17.150 --> 06:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court had issued a ruling
 
06:48:19.610 --> 06:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
earlier last year
 
06:48:22.190 --> 06:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
in fact in April
 
06:48:25.730 --> 06:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
that said there has to be a balance
 
06:48:28.310 --> 06:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
a balance between the Public's right to
 
06:48:28.320 --> 06:48:29.750 align:start position:0%
a balance between the Public's right to
know

06:48:29.750 --> 06:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:48:33.350 --> 06:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
and the necessity in many cases
 
06:48:36.468 --> 06:48:36.478 align:start position:0%
of attorney-client privilege
 
06:48:41.208 --> 06:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
there has to be that balance because we
 
06:48:43.670 --> 06:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
are on one side of the attorney-client
 
06:48:47.330 --> 06:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
relationship We the People
 
06:48:50.090 --> 06:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
have our elected representatives
 
06:48:52.670 --> 06:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
in various positions across the state
 
06:48:55.270 --> 06:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
and on localities and in the state
 
06:48:57.948 --> 06:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
representing us
 
06:49:01.250 --> 06:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
and those people
 
06:49:03.048 --> 06:49:03.058 align:start position:0%
are going and getting advice from an
 
06:49:03.058 --> 06:49:03.948 align:start position:0%
are going and getting advice from an
attorney

06:49:03.948 --> 06:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
06:49:08.330 --> 06:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:10.610 --> 06:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
but we're not allowed to see it
 
06:49:12.170 --> 06:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to know what it was
 
06:49:13.910 --> 06:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to know who the
 
06:49:15.708 --> 06:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
attorneys are
 
06:49:17.628 --> 06:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
that's ridiculous
 
06:49:18.830 --> 06:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
I think
 
06:49:20.810 --> 06:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
and that's why this bill
 
06:49:23.510 --> 06:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
I could ramble but I'm not going to we
 
06:49:25.070 --> 06:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
have people behind us who have been
 
06:49:26.990 --> 06:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
solely aggrieved by this already and
 
06:49:29.030 --> 06:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to provide you a lot more
 
06:49:31.070 --> 06:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
information than I will but I will take
 
06:49:34.670 --> 06:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
a few questions if you so desire
 
06:49:37.010 --> 06:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I see a question or I saw a raised
 
06:49:39.830 --> 06:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
hand from representative Sylvia
 
06:49:41.810 --> 06:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:49:44.208 --> 06:49:44.218 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:49:47.030 --> 06:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
this was just enacted this past July I
 
06:49:47.040 --> 06:49:48.048 align:start position:0%
this was just enacted this past July I
believe

06:49:48.048 --> 06:49:48.058 align:start position:0%
believe
 
06:49:51.708 --> 06:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
and it was uh
 
06:49:54.048 --> 06:49:54.058 align:start position:0%
brought about within one of these
 
06:49:57.530 --> 06:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills that came out of the
 
06:49:59.990 --> 06:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
Senate originally as I recall do you uh
 
06:50:02.510 --> 06:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
have the number of that bill that it was
 
06:50:05.330 --> 06:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh so the bill was house bill 108.
 
06:50:07.010 --> 06:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
and it had nothing to do with the
 
06:50:09.110 --> 06:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege
 
06:50:11.690 --> 06:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
the attorney-client privilege
 
06:50:13.968 --> 06:50:13.978 align:start position:0%
part that is now this law that I'm
 
06:50:15.590 --> 06:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
seeking to repeal
 
06:50:17.448 --> 06:50:17.458 align:start position:0%
was brought into the committee of
 
06:50:17.458 --> 06:50:18.530 align:start position:0%
was brought into the committee of
conference

06:50:18.530 --> 06:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
conference
 
06:50:20.390 --> 06:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
from the Senate
 
06:50:21.890 --> 06:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
and that's why I say it was never
 
06:50:24.110 --> 06:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
discussed in this committee it was never
 
06:50:26.570 --> 06:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
debated in the house
 
06:50:30.410 --> 06:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:33.048 --> 06:50:33.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:38.510 --> 06:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:40.310 --> 06:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
06:50:44.090 --> 06:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:46.490 --> 06:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
next I have
 
06:51:00.110 --> 06:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:03.048 --> 06:51:03.058 align:start position:0%
you hit the microphone please good
 
06:51:05.810 --> 06:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Lori ortolano I'm
 
06:51:08.270 --> 06:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
from Nashua and
 
06:51:08.280 --> 06:51:09.890 align:start position:0%
from Nashua and
um

06:51:09.890 --> 06:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:11.990 --> 06:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a member I'm the vice president of
 
06:51:14.628 --> 06:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
right to know Nashua and right to know I
 
06:51:16.310 --> 06:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
mean right to know New Hampshire and
 
06:51:18.350 --> 06:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire is strongly
 
06:51:21.948 --> 06:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
supporting HB 1073 the repeal of this
 
06:51:21.958 --> 06:51:23.930 align:start position:0%
supporting HB 1073 the repeal of this
exemption

06:51:23.930 --> 06:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
06:51:23.940 --> 06:51:24.530 align:start position:0%
exemption
um

06:51:24.530 --> 06:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:26.930 --> 06:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
as representative ruleper just told you
 
06:51:31.610 --> 06:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
this sort of snuck in in May of last
 
06:51:35.448 --> 06:51:35.458 align:start position:0%
year into a senate hearing uh under HB
 
06:51:37.368 --> 06:51:37.378 align:start position:0%
108 which had nothing to do with
 
06:51:38.930 --> 06:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege or work
 
06:51:42.170 --> 06:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
product and it came out of a Supreme
 
06:51:45.708 --> 06:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
Court ruling in on April 21st regarding
 
06:51:48.170 --> 06:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
the Hampstead school board versus SAU
 
06:51:48.180 --> 06:51:49.968 align:start position:0%
the Hampstead school board versus SAU
55.

06:51:49.968 --> 06:51:49.978 align:start position:0%
55.
 
06:51:53.390 --> 06:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
and that was a very unique case
 
06:51:55.670 --> 06:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
um where a joint school board made up of
 
06:51:57.468 --> 06:51:57.478 align:start position:0%
Hampstead and Timberlane had
 
06:52:00.190 --> 06:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
commissioned a report to be done
 
06:52:02.930 --> 06:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
because there was a dispute between the
 
06:52:04.910 --> 06:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
boards that one board was treating
 
06:52:07.070 --> 06:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
employees of the school district poorly
 
06:52:09.410 --> 06:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
so they opened an investigation
 
06:52:11.868 --> 06:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
when the report was completed only one
 
06:52:14.330 --> 06:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
board was given access to the report and
 
06:52:17.690 --> 06:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
the other board wasn't and the Hampstead
 
06:52:19.190 --> 06:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
board believed not only should they have
 
06:52:20.810 --> 06:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
access but it was a public document
 
06:52:23.090 --> 06:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
because it was paid for by taxpayer
 
06:52:25.968 --> 06:52:25.978 align:start position:0%
dollars the lower courts ruled in favor
 
06:52:28.610 --> 06:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
of Hampstead and when it went to the
 
06:52:30.350 --> 06:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I believe they ruled in
 
06:52:32.330 --> 06:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
favor as well and wanted a balancing
 
06:52:36.350 --> 06:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
test applied to that type of report that
 
06:52:40.190 --> 06:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
was a very unique situation and I've
 
06:52:42.890 --> 06:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
gone through a lot of right to know
 
06:52:45.890 --> 06:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
issues in Nashua I just came out of a
 
06:52:47.750 --> 06:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
big lawsuit a three-day suit in court
 
06:52:50.090 --> 06:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
with six claims and there's probably
 
06:52:51.968 --> 06:52:51.978 align:start position:0%
been about 14
 
06:52:54.590 --> 06:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
claims of right to no violations down
 
06:52:57.410 --> 06:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
there over the last two years
 
06:52:57.420 --> 06:52:58.310 align:start position:0%
there over the last two years
um

06:52:58.310 --> 06:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:01.128 --> 06:53:01.138 align:start position:0%
and the dra acted on four of them and
 
06:53:03.830 --> 06:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
found them in violation there have been
 
06:53:06.410 --> 06:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
two that have gone through that were
 
06:53:09.890 --> 06:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
awarded to the citizens and there's a
 
06:53:12.650 --> 06:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
handful about another eight coming out
 
06:53:13.910 --> 06:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the pipeline
 
06:53:13.920 --> 06:53:15.110 align:start position:0%
of the pipeline
so

06:53:15.110 --> 06:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:53:15.120 --> 06:53:17.090 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:53:17.090 --> 06:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:19.490 --> 06:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
I'd like to provide an example of where
 
06:53:22.070 --> 06:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
I see abuses in this attorney-client
 
06:53:23.510 --> 06:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
privilege and work product that's
 
06:53:26.690 --> 06:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
happening in Nashua and I'm concerned
 
06:53:28.128 --> 06:53:28.138 align:start position:0%
that the broad language of this
 
06:53:30.110 --> 06:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
exemption what got added in Roman
 
06:53:33.230 --> 06:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
numeral 12 will sweep away this per se
 
06:53:35.270 --> 06:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
exemption that's listed now will sweep
 
06:53:38.110 --> 06:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
away our opportunity to get information
 
06:53:41.030 --> 06:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
that is public information that
 
06:53:42.468 --> 06:53:42.478 align:start position:0%
municipalities are saying is
 
06:53:42.478 --> 06:53:44.270 align:start position:0%
municipalities are saying is
attorney-client

06:53:44.270 --> 06:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
attorney-client
 
06:53:46.250 --> 06:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
um in
 
06:53:49.548 --> 06:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
June of 2021 my city conducted voluntary
 
06:53:52.070 --> 06:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
right to know training I submitted a
 
06:53:55.250 --> 06:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
request for the record records of the
 
06:53:56.990 --> 06:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
documents provided to do the training
 
06:53:59.570 --> 06:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
the city Legal Office denied the request
 
06:54:03.350 --> 06:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
under 91a colon 5 Roman numeral four
 
06:54:06.890 --> 06:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
this was denied in early July before the
 
06:54:08.810 --> 06:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
law took effect
 
06:54:11.510 --> 06:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
at that time any denials for
 
06:54:13.270 --> 06:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege or work
 
06:54:15.650 --> 06:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
Doctrine product fell under the
 
06:54:18.170 --> 06:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
exemption of Roman numeral 4. there was
 
06:54:21.708 --> 06:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
an exemption there it existed
 
06:54:23.628 --> 06:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
um believing that this exemption was
 
06:54:25.788 --> 06:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
misapplied I sought advice from another
 
06:54:27.890 --> 06:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
citizen to file the request as well to
 
06:54:30.350 --> 06:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
the legal office she too was again
 
06:54:30.360 --> 06:54:31.610 align:start position:0%
the legal office she too was again
denied

06:54:31.610 --> 06:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
denied
 
06:54:34.070 --> 06:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
I informed the city that I would be
 
06:54:36.170 --> 06:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
requesting and wanted the court to do an
 
06:54:38.030 --> 06:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
in-camera review and would they ascent
 
06:54:40.968 --> 06:54:40.978 align:start position:0%
and the city would not respond so I then
 
06:54:43.430 --> 06:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
asked two elected officials that I had a
 
06:54:46.128 --> 06:54:46.138 align:start position:0%
good relationship with a Department of
 
06:54:49.070 --> 06:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
Public Works commissioner and one of the
 
06:54:51.468 --> 06:54:51.478 align:start position:0%
aldermen if they would request the city
 
06:54:53.750 --> 06:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
to provide those attorney-client
 
06:54:56.090 --> 06:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
privileged documents to look at them and
 
06:54:58.850 --> 06:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
the two elected officials did and I said
 
06:55:00.590 --> 06:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
you can't disclose to me what's in them
 
06:55:03.110 --> 06:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
but could you tell me if you see them as
 
06:55:05.628 --> 06:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
confidential documents both of them said
 
06:55:07.670 --> 06:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
no there's nothing confidential in here
 
06:55:10.190 --> 06:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
I don't understand it within two days
 
06:55:13.968 --> 06:55:13.978 align:start position:0%
the city released all the material so by
 
06:55:15.650 --> 06:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
pushing it through and I was going to
 
06:55:18.288 --> 06:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
file a lawsuit and go into court my
 
06:55:20.510 --> 06:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
concern is this language that got put in
 
06:55:23.510 --> 06:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
July 31st would now take away my ability
 
06:55:26.270 --> 06:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
to have these records and I emailed in
 
06:55:28.788 --> 06:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
the responsive documents I didn't print
 
06:55:31.128 --> 06:55:31.138 align:start position:0%
them out I have a copy of this statement
 
06:55:33.230 --> 06:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
I'll give to you but I emailed in the
 
06:55:35.628 --> 06:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
responsive documents and the documents
 
06:55:38.570 --> 06:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
the city used in training is simply the
 
06:55:41.150 --> 06:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
right to know law printed out I mean
 
06:55:43.070 --> 06:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's pretty what's confidential about
 
06:55:46.788 --> 06:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
that they had an Excel spreadsheet that
 
06:55:50.110 --> 06:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
they laid out in columns to show
 
06:55:53.350 --> 06:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
employees how to track a right to know
 
06:55:56.868 --> 06:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
they cited the exemptions and how to do
 
06:56:00.350 --> 06:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
redactions they gave a sample letter on
 
06:56:02.750 --> 06:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
how to write a right to no response and
 
06:56:05.448 --> 06:56:05.458 align:start position:0%
then they gave two actually and then
 
06:56:09.110 --> 06:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
they gave them the Excel information on
 
06:56:11.510 --> 06:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
how to filter and sort the spreadsheet
 
06:56:13.250 --> 06:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
that they put together to track right to
 
06:56:15.590 --> 06:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
knows this was all denied
 
06:56:18.170 --> 06:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
there is it's absurd to me
 
06:56:21.110 --> 06:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I am very concerned that if I hadn't
 
06:56:23.628 --> 06:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
got this in by July 3rd
 
06:56:26.810 --> 06:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
I would not have gotten it now I did put
 
06:56:29.750 --> 06:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
in a right to know request after this to
 
06:56:32.030 --> 06:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
get in the
 
06:56:34.128 --> 06:56:34.138 align:start position:0%
um right to know submitted to the city
 
06:56:36.288 --> 06:56:36.298 align:start position:0%
so I want to see how many right to know
 
06:56:38.030 --> 06:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
requests are coming into my city because
 
06:56:40.730 --> 06:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
the city hired a dedicated right to know
 
06:56:43.788 --> 06:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
attorney to handle right to no requests
 
06:56:46.250 --> 06:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
I thought that was relatively absurd
 
06:56:47.990 --> 06:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we would have an attorney for that
 
06:56:50.330 --> 06:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
but I said hey how much work is coming
 
06:56:53.390 --> 06:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
in how many right to knows you have a
 
06:56:56.690 --> 06:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
list denied as attorney client work
 
06:56:56.700 --> 06:56:57.590 align:start position:0%
list denied as attorney client work
product

06:56:57.590 --> 06:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
product
 
06:56:59.810 --> 06:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
I can't see the right to knows coming
 
06:57:01.150 --> 06:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
into the city
 
06:57:03.948 --> 06:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
what's what's what's so confidential on
 
06:57:06.650 --> 06:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
here the only column is cc'd to the
 
06:57:08.628 --> 06:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
attorney's office if you want to redact
 
06:57:09.890 --> 06:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
that because you don't want to have a
 
06:57:12.410 --> 06:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
check box and they're redacted but don't
 
06:57:14.330 --> 06:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
not allow me to see all the requests
 
06:57:16.548 --> 06:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
that are coming into the city and when
 
06:57:18.708 --> 06:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
the city uses attorney-client privileged
 
06:57:20.690 --> 06:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
information they use two and work
 
06:57:24.288 --> 06:57:24.298 align:start position:0%
product exactly who's the client
 
06:57:27.468 --> 06:57:27.478 align:start position:0%
I don't understand that
 
06:57:29.628 --> 06:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't want this law
 
06:57:32.570 --> 06:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
strengthened the way what was put in
 
06:57:35.628 --> 06:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
there last year was a knee-jerk reaction
 
06:57:38.030 --> 06:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
to a Supreme Court ruling that came out
 
06:57:40.490 --> 06:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
on April 21st I believe it was a
 
06:57:42.890 --> 06:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
reaction people's hair lit on fire and
 
06:57:45.110 --> 06:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
they said oh my gosh all of a sudden our
 
06:57:46.730 --> 06:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
work is going to be out on the table for
 
06:57:48.948 --> 06:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
everyone to have no it isn't you had
 
06:57:52.610 --> 06:57:52.620 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral four RSA 91a colon 5 Roman
 
06:57:54.730 --> 06:57:54.740 align:start position:0%
numeral four confidential information
 
06:57:57.890 --> 06:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
that's where all legal offices slam the
 
06:57:59.350 --> 06:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
exemption if they wanted to use
 
06:58:01.070 --> 06:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privileged information
 
06:58:04.490 --> 06:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
and Doctrine as a as a withholding
 
06:58:07.190 --> 06:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that both to write a per
 
06:58:11.090 --> 06:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
se exemption now that potentially
 
06:58:12.590 --> 06:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know how I'm going to take that
 
06:58:14.330 --> 06:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
into court
 
06:58:16.910 --> 06:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how to challenge that
 
06:58:16.920 --> 06:58:18.590 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how to challenge that
so

06:58:18.590 --> 06:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:58:20.868 --> 06:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
um right to know New Hampshire feels
 
06:58:22.968 --> 06:58:22.978 align:start position:0%
very strongly that this language should
 
06:58:26.270 --> 06:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
be repealed it really was not vetted
 
06:58:26.280 --> 06:58:28.670 align:start position:0%
be repealed it really was not vetted
properly

06:58:28.670 --> 06:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
properly
 
06:58:30.530 --> 06:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:58:34.910 --> 06:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll go over here this time uh
 
06:58:37.070 --> 06:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative page please
 
06:58:38.990 --> 06:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:58:41.208 --> 06:58:41.218 align:start position:0%
taking my question so it's been a while
 
06:58:43.190 --> 06:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
since I've read the Hampstead case but
 
06:58:46.610 --> 06:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
is the Practical effect of repealing the
 
06:58:48.410 --> 06:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
exemption of the attorney work product
 
06:58:51.948 --> 06:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
with this proposal be reverting back to
 
06:58:54.770 --> 06:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
the Hampstead balancing test and you've
 
06:58:56.448 --> 06:58:56.458 align:start position:0%
that that was there and are you
 
06:58:58.368 --> 06:58:58.378 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that as
 
06:59:00.530 --> 06:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
as where it is
 
06:59:02.208 --> 06:59:02.218 align:start position:0%
I'm totally comfortable with that
 
06:59:04.910 --> 06:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
because there was always attorney-client
 
06:59:06.770 --> 06:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
exemptions through Roman numeral four
 
06:59:09.048 --> 06:59:09.058 align:start position:0%
now it just so happened that a Joint
 
06:59:11.150 --> 06:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
School Board argued over a document
 
06:59:14.448 --> 06:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
being public and that was listed as
 
06:59:16.968 --> 06:59:16.978 align:start position:0%
confidential attorney client privileged
 
06:59:19.670 --> 06:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
and it went to challenge they challenged
 
06:59:21.708 --> 06:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
it they had the opportunity to do that
 
06:59:23.570 --> 06:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
the fact that the court allowed a
 
06:59:25.490 --> 06:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
balancing test to take place on that
 
06:59:28.368 --> 06:59:28.378 align:start position:0%
that's fairly unique and specific to
 
06:59:32.270 --> 06:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
that situation and I don't see why
 
06:59:35.390 --> 06:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
allowing that to be the case if you have
 
06:59:37.250 --> 06:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
a specific if you have a unique
 
06:59:39.110 --> 06:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
situation is a problem
 
06:59:42.590 --> 06:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
I mean that's a very specific case my
 
06:59:44.390 --> 06:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
situation of asking for the training
 
06:59:47.628 --> 06:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
material used to educate city workers on
 
06:59:50.150 --> 06:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
right to know to have that be exempt was
 
06:59:50.160 --> 06:59:51.110 align:start position:0%
right to know to have that be exempt was
just

06:59:51.110 --> 06:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:59:55.010 --> 06:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
crazy I mean I thought my city would
 
06:59:57.288 --> 06:59:57.298 align:start position:0%
want to showcase I found out kind of
 
06:59:58.730 --> 06:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
under the radar that they had done
 
07:00:01.070 --> 07:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
training so what's the secret that's a
 
07:00:04.128 --> 07:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
that's a very positive thing to tell the
 
07:00:06.170 --> 07:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
community you're educating your city
 
07:00:08.448 --> 07:00:08.458 align:start position:0%
workers on the right to NOLA I'd be
 
07:00:10.368 --> 07:00:10.378 align:start position:0%
showcasing that to everyone
 
07:00:13.850 --> 07:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
they hit it and locked the records down
 
07:00:17.150 --> 07:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:21.350 --> 07:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:23.150 --> 07:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman thank
 
07:00:25.310 --> 07:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
you much Miss ortolano um
 
07:00:26.868 --> 07:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
if I remember what you said you said
 
07:00:29.270 --> 07:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
they sort of adopted it with
 
07:00:31.788 --> 07:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
this provision without a without a
 
07:00:33.048 --> 07:00:33.058 align:start position:0%
hearing but I actually checked the
 
07:00:35.030 --> 07:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
docket for the bill
 
07:00:37.610 --> 07:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
that enacted it and it was part of like
 
07:00:39.590 --> 07:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
some changes to other parts of 91a and
 
07:00:41.868 --> 07:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
it looked like they actually did have a
 
07:00:43.850 --> 07:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
hearing specifically on this amendment
 
07:00:47.208 --> 07:00:47.218 align:start position:0%
sometime in mid-may but it's uh he's
 
07:00:49.548 --> 07:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
right oh so is that is that correct I
 
07:00:51.288 --> 07:00:51.298 align:start position:0%
guess you are correct I meant a house
 
07:00:53.628 --> 07:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
hearing they did do a senate Hearing in
 
07:00:55.910 --> 07:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
mid-may you're correct oh all right I
 
07:00:58.490 --> 07:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
understand okay thanks yeah
 
07:01:01.670 --> 07:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:04.730 --> 07:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
no okay representative Chase
 
07:01:07.128 --> 07:01:07.138 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
07:01:11.750 --> 07:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
question comment who is it in Nashua say
 
07:01:13.730 --> 07:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry is it Nashville that you're
 
07:01:16.190 --> 07:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
from yes I apologize that that makes
 
07:01:19.368 --> 07:01:19.378 align:start position:0%
this decision is it um the city council
 
07:01:22.128 --> 07:01:22.138 align:start position:0%
is it the mayor who is it that's saying
 
07:01:24.590 --> 07:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
no we're sealing these records it it it
 
07:01:27.110 --> 07:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
varies actually we have a lot of uh
 
07:01:29.150 --> 07:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
confusion down there because there is no
 
07:01:31.368 --> 07:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
Central record right to no request area
 
07:01:33.890 --> 07:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
that your request comes in
 
07:01:36.048 --> 07:01:36.058 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to get a process going
 
07:01:38.090 --> 07:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
where right to knows are
 
07:01:40.070 --> 07:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
I believe should be accepted by the
 
07:01:42.948 --> 07:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
clerk's office but you're left as a
 
07:01:44.990 --> 07:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
citizen to try and figure out who should
 
07:01:46.368 --> 07:01:46.378 align:start position:0%
get your request and where the
 
07:01:48.830 --> 07:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
information is stored you know that's
 
07:01:50.330 --> 07:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
not even clear and I think that's true
 
07:01:52.610 --> 07:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
for some municipalities citizens go in
 
07:01:54.948 --> 07:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
with a request they got to figure out
 
07:01:56.208 --> 07:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
that they're going to the right office
 
07:01:59.208 --> 07:01:59.218 align:start position:0%
that has the records so
 
07:02:02.270 --> 07:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
um in this case it this request made its
 
07:02:04.368 --> 07:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
way up to the legal office because I
 
07:02:05.750 --> 07:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
didn't even know the legal office did
 
07:02:07.670 --> 07:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
the training my original thought was
 
07:02:09.770 --> 07:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
that the clerk's office did the training
 
07:02:11.868 --> 07:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
but it ended up it was the legal office
 
07:02:14.390 --> 07:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
that did the training and so it was
 
07:02:16.430 --> 07:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
denied by the legal office
 
07:02:18.948 --> 07:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
some denials come from you know an
 
07:02:20.570 --> 07:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
administrative office
 
07:02:22.788 --> 07:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
there's no set format to where the
 
07:02:24.410 --> 07:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
denials come from or how the information
 
07:02:28.190 --> 07:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:30.948 --> 07:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else any more
 
07:02:33.948 --> 07:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:35.570 --> 07:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
07:02:38.390 --> 07:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:00.230 --> 07:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:02.090 --> 07:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
you may be
 
07:03:03.468 --> 07:03:03.478 align:start position:0%

Wilson I'm from the Attorney General's
 
07:03:07.368 --> 07:03:07.378 align:start position:0%
office I'm an Assistant Attorney General
 
07:03:09.530 --> 07:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
assigned to the office's transportation

and construction Bureau I'm here today
 
07:03:13.368 --> 07:03:13.378 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the department to testify
 
07:03:16.548 --> 07:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
in opposition to HB 1073.
 
07:03:18.288 --> 07:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
this exemption that we're talking about
 
07:03:20.510 --> 07:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
touches on two important legal Concepts
 
07:03:23.750 --> 07:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
in our in our system so the first is the
 
07:03:26.110 --> 07:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
attorney client privilege and simply put
 
07:03:28.610 --> 07:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
when a person seeks legal advice from a
 
07:03:30.170 --> 07:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
lawyer the communications between them
 
07:03:31.610 --> 07:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
are deemed confidential under that
 
07:03:33.948 --> 07:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
privilege this protection provides a
 
07:03:35.390 --> 07:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
safe environment for people to obtain
 
07:03:37.250 --> 07:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
legal advice from their attorneys
 
07:03:39.170 --> 07:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
without it clients may be less likely to
 
07:03:41.150 --> 07:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
seek advice ask questions or be honest
 
07:03:42.770 --> 07:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
with their attorneys and forthcoming
 
07:03:45.048 --> 07:03:45.058 align:start position:0%
about the facts it is considered one of
 
07:03:47.270 --> 07:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
the most sacrosanct and closely guarded
 
07:03:48.770 --> 07:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
privileges in the American legal system
 
07:03:51.288 --> 07:03:51.298 align:start position:0%
it's deeply rooted in common law and the
 
07:03:52.670 --> 07:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
Civil rules and the ethical rules
 
07:03:55.190 --> 07:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
governing lawyers are written to ensure
 
07:03:56.990 --> 07:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
that these communications remain
 
07:03:57.000 --> 07:03:58.490 align:start position:0%
that these communications remain
protected

07:03:58.490 --> 07:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
protected
 
07:04:00.288 --> 07:04:00.298 align:start position:0%
the second concept is the attorney work
 
07:04:02.690 --> 07:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
product Doctrine where the
 
07:04:04.730 --> 07:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege community
 
07:04:07.010 --> 07:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
attorney client privilege protects the
 
07:04:09.288 --> 07:04:09.298 align:start position:0%
communications this Doctrine protects
 
07:04:11.390 --> 07:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
materials created in anticipation of
 
07:04:13.670 --> 07:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
litigation so this allows attorneys to
 
07:04:15.590 --> 07:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
thoroughly prepare for cases without
 
07:04:17.090 --> 07:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
concern that other people are going to
 
07:04:18.410 --> 07:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
be able to access their mental
 
07:04:19.968 --> 07:04:19.978 align:start position:0%
Impressions their legal theories their
 
07:04:19.978 --> 07:04:21.048 align:start position:0%
Impressions their legal theories their
strategies

07:04:21.048 --> 07:04:21.058 align:start position:0%
strategies
 
07:04:23.448 --> 07:04:23.458 align:start position:0%
both of these two protections apply both
 
07:04:26.270 --> 07:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
in the civil and criminal context and
 
07:04:27.770 --> 07:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
they are both critical to providing
 
07:04:29.868 --> 07:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
legal effective legal representation to
 
07:04:29.878 --> 07:04:31.070 align:start position:0%
legal effective legal representation to
clients

07:04:31.070 --> 07:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
clients
 
07:04:32.868 --> 07:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice represents
 
07:04:34.910 --> 07:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
over a hundred State agencies licensing
 
07:04:36.770 --> 07:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions in addition to
 
07:04:39.170 --> 07:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
this under RSA 99d
 
07:04:41.390 --> 07:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
the doj might represent individual state
 
07:04:43.610 --> 07:04:43.620 align:start position:0%

07:04:45.110 --> 07:04:45.120 align:start position:0%

cases on behalf of the state
 
07:04:58.490 --> 07:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
in providing these Legal Services doj's
 
07:05:00.530 --> 07:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
Communications with its clients are no
 
07:05:02.030 --> 07:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
different in nature from Communications
 
07:05:04.010 --> 07:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
that are provided between an attorney
 
07:05:06.410 --> 07:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
and a client and a private sector many
 
07:05:08.090 --> 07:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
of the agency's boards and officials
 
07:05:09.830 --> 07:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
that we represent are in regular contact
 
07:05:12.530 --> 07:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
with us seeking legal advice and just as
 
07:05:14.390 --> 07:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
with a private client the privilege is
 
07:05:15.650 --> 07:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
afforded to those Communications
 
07:05:17.750 --> 07:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
encourages our clients to come to us
 
07:05:20.390 --> 07:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
with ideas and questions
 
07:05:22.128 --> 07:05:22.138 align:start position:0%
and be fully open with us about the
 
07:05:23.628 --> 07:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
facts so that we can provide meaningful
 
07:05:26.030 --> 07:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
advice these ongoing Communications
 
07:05:28.010 --> 07:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
enable our clients to operate and make
 
07:05:29.390 --> 07:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
decisions with the benefit of legal
 
07:05:31.310 --> 07:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
advice and in turn this allows them to
 
07:05:34.670 --> 07:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
better serve the public of New Hampshire
 
07:05:36.530 --> 07:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
to provide effective representation in
 
07:05:38.270 --> 07:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
both criminal and civil cases it's also
 
07:05:39.830 --> 07:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
important that government lawyers just
 
07:05:41.570 --> 07:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
like private lawyers are able to
 
07:05:43.788 --> 07:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
strategize and prepare in their cases
 
07:05:45.948 --> 07:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
their mental Impressions their theories
 
07:05:47.810 --> 07:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
their trial strategies are entitled to
 
07:05:49.910 --> 07:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
the same exact protections that are
 
07:05:52.548 --> 07:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
afforded to to private attorneys to deem
 
07:05:54.170 --> 07:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
otherwise would put government attorneys
 
07:05:56.628 --> 07:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
in the state and an extreme disadvantage
 
07:05:58.430 --> 07:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
in cases and significantly hinder their
 
07:06:00.288 --> 07:06:00.298 align:start position:0%
ability to litigate cases both in
 
07:06:03.770 --> 07:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:05.810 --> 07:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
this is well established in common law
 
07:06:07.490 --> 07:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
that the protections afforded by the
 
07:06:09.410 --> 07:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege and the
 
07:06:11.030 --> 07:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
attorney work product Doctrine are just
 
07:06:12.948 --> 07:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
as critical to legal representation in
 
07:06:14.330 --> 07:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
the public realm as they are in the
 
07:06:15.468 --> 07:06:15.478 align:start position:0%
private Realm
 
07:06:17.750 --> 07:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
the existing exemption in 91a doesn't
 
07:06:19.968 --> 07:06:19.978 align:start position:0%
alter these protections it simply
 
07:06:21.650 --> 07:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
codifies what's already been well
 
07:06:23.448 --> 07:06:23.458 align:start position:0%
established which is that the
 
07:06:24.708 --> 07:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege and work
 
07:06:26.750 --> 07:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
product Doctrine apply with equal force
 
07:06:28.310 --> 07:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
to government clients and lawyers
 
07:06:30.410 --> 07:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
representing those attorneys those
 
07:06:33.530 --> 07:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
clients and as 91a is presently written
 
07:06:35.030 --> 07:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
it appropriately reflects these
 
07:06:36.590 --> 07:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
protections and for these reasons the
 
07:06:38.390 --> 07:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice is opposing the
 
07:06:42.170 --> 07:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
bill happy to take any questions
 
07:06:44.330 --> 07:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
do I see any questions from the
 
07:06:44.340 --> 07:06:47.030 align:start position:0%
do I see any questions from the
committee

07:06:47.030 --> 07:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:49.910 --> 07:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
07:06:54.288 --> 07:06:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:04.070 --> 07:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:06.708 --> 07:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Margaret Burns
 
07:07:08.150 --> 07:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the New
 
07:07:10.310 --> 07:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and we
 
07:07:12.590 --> 07:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
are here this afternoon in opposition to
 
07:07:15.530 --> 07:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1073 which would repeal the
 
07:07:17.208 --> 07:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
exemption under the right to no law for
 
07:07:18.830 --> 07:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
records protected by attorney-client
 
07:07:21.110 --> 07:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
privilege and the attorney work product
 
07:07:23.690 --> 07:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
Doctrine the legislature passed this
 
07:07:26.150 --> 07:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
important Amendment to the right to know
 
07:07:28.548 --> 07:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
law last year it was supported by the
 
07:07:30.048 --> 07:07:30.058 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Attorney General's office
 
07:07:32.170 --> 07:07:32.180 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Bar Association
 
07:07:35.208 --> 07:07:35.218 align:start position:0%
Municipal attorneys Municipal officials
 
07:07:36.770 --> 07:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
and of course the New Hampshire
 
07:07:38.750 --> 07:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association
 
07:07:41.090 --> 07:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
repealing this important exemption would
 
07:07:43.010 --> 07:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
be devastating both for local government
 
07:07:45.230 --> 07:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
and for state government it will not
 
07:07:47.750 --> 07:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
only jeopardize the ability of local and
 
07:07:50.390 --> 07:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
state government to access and seek
 
07:07:52.850 --> 07:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
legal advice confidential confidentially
 
07:07:55.310 --> 07:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
and appropriately but it will also
 
07:07:57.230 --> 07:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
create a conundrum for government
 
07:08:00.410 --> 07:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
attorneys who like all attorneys have an
 
07:08:02.990 --> 07:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
ethical obligation to protect a client's
 
07:08:05.628 --> 07:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
confidential information there are not
 
07:08:08.448 --> 07:08:08.458 align:start position:0%
two classes of clients clients who have
 
07:08:10.788 --> 07:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
the right to confidentiality and clients
 
07:08:13.368 --> 07:08:13.378 align:start position:0%
who do not that applies both to private
 
07:08:16.548 --> 07:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
clients and to governmental clients if
 
07:08:18.288 --> 07:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
all written legal advice to the
 
07:08:20.090 --> 07:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
government is subject to disclosure
 
07:08:22.730 --> 07:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
governmental attorneys will be extremely
 
07:08:25.368 --> 07:08:25.378 align:start position:0%
cautious about putting legal advice in
 
07:08:27.288 --> 07:08:27.298 align:start position:0%
writing they will be concerned about
 
07:08:29.390 --> 07:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
their legal advice being subject to
 
07:08:30.948 --> 07:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
public disclosure
 
07:08:33.650 --> 07:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
chilling this kind of discourse between
 
07:08:36.170 --> 07:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
a client and their attorney where the
 
07:08:38.750 --> 07:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
attorney is fearful of putting legal
 
07:08:41.390 --> 07:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
advice in writing is only going to stop
 
07:08:43.850 --> 07:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
governmental entities and clients from
 
07:08:45.530 --> 07:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
seeking legal advice and receiving
 
07:08:47.990 --> 07:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
important legal advice that they need to
 
07:08:49.968 --> 07:08:49.978 align:start position:0%
make risk assessments and decisions
 
07:08:52.430 --> 07:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
about how to proceed
 
07:08:54.530 --> 07:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
there was some testimony earlier today
 
07:08:56.628 --> 07:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
that talked about the right to know laws
 
07:08:58.730 --> 07:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
Provisions related to non-public
 
07:09:01.190 --> 07:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
sessions that apply to receiving legal
 
07:09:03.590 --> 07:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
advice as well as the ability to have a
 
07:09:05.990 --> 07:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
non-meeting so not a public meeting
 
07:09:07.730 --> 07:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
under the right to know law for the
 
07:09:09.530 --> 07:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
purpose of legal advice
 
07:09:11.330 --> 07:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
important to note that those exemptions
 
07:09:14.570 --> 07:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
apply to a meetings scenario of a public
 
07:09:17.510 --> 07:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
body and do not have anything to do with
 
07:09:20.270 --> 07:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
written legal advice received from an
 
07:09:22.548 --> 07:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
attorney to a governmental entity or
 
07:09:24.708 --> 07:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
client so provisions and the right to no
 
07:09:26.390 --> 07:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
law that would allow for a non-public
 
07:09:29.030 --> 07:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
session or a non-meeting do not cover
 
07:09:31.070 --> 07:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
scenarios where the attorney has
 
07:09:33.830 --> 07:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
submitted legal advice in writing to a
 
07:09:36.590 --> 07:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
public agency a department or a public
 
07:09:36.600 --> 07:09:38.150 align:start position:0%
public agency a department or a public
body

07:09:38.150 --> 07:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
body
 
07:09:41.570 --> 07:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
finally in opposing the amendment to the
 
07:09:44.208 --> 07:09:44.218 align:start position:0%
right to know law last year and also in
 
07:09:46.850 --> 07:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
supporting this repeal of the exemption
 
07:09:49.490 --> 07:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
this year there has been some
 
07:09:52.610 --> 07:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
conversation that it is the citizens of
 
07:09:54.830 --> 07:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
the state or the citizens of a community
 
07:09:57.468 --> 07:09:57.478 align:start position:0%
or a municipality who are actually the
 
07:10:00.590 --> 07:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
client not in fact the municipality the
 
07:10:03.048 --> 07:10:03.058 align:start position:0%
political subdivision or the state
 
07:10:05.990 --> 07:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
Just Like A Private Client just like a
 
07:10:08.270 --> 07:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
private Corporation or a private entity
 
07:10:11.810 --> 07:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
a municipality is an entity that is able
 
07:10:14.810 --> 07:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
to seek and obtain legal advice and
 
07:10:17.570 --> 07:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
legal representation and again they are
 
07:10:19.548 --> 07:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
protected by the same attorney-client
 
07:10:21.288 --> 07:10:21.298 align:start position:0%
privilege and the attorney who
 
07:10:23.868 --> 07:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
represents them is also subject to the
 
07:10:26.030 --> 07:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
same duty of confidentiality that they
 
07:10:28.610 --> 07:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
would for any other client
 
07:10:30.590 --> 07:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we urge the committee
 
07:10:33.468 --> 07:10:33.478 align:start position:0%
to recommend this bill as inexpedient to
 
07:10:35.208 --> 07:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'm happy to take any
 
07:10:35.218 --> 07:10:36.830 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'm happy to take any
questions

07:10:36.830 --> 07:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:10:39.350 --> 07:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
do we have questions I see just
 
07:10:41.090 --> 07:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative page please
 
07:10:42.708 --> 07:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
07:10:44.990 --> 07:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question I know obviously this
 
07:10:46.368 --> 07:10:46.378 align:start position:0%
question wouldn't arise in terms of
 
07:10:47.868 --> 07:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
right to know where the private company
 
07:10:50.868 --> 07:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
with their with their attorney are there
 
07:10:53.208 --> 07:10:53.218 align:start position:0%
efficiencies captured that may benefit a
 
07:10:54.708 --> 07:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayer through
 
07:10:57.048 --> 07:10:57.058 align:start position:0%
a Frank advice that an attorney could
 
07:11:00.048 --> 07:11:00.058 align:start position:0%
give to a client to work through work
 
07:11:02.510 --> 07:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
product or attorney a client privileged
 
07:11:04.010 --> 07:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
information in terms of
 
07:11:07.070 --> 07:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh well being an efficient kind of means
 
07:11:09.110 --> 07:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
to resolving a potential dispute if you
 
07:11:11.270 --> 07:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
if you capture my question I I think I
 
07:11:12.770 --> 07:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
understand the question and here's what
 
07:11:14.868 --> 07:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
I'll say and I know that there are
 
07:11:17.410 --> 07:11:17.420 align:start position:0%
attorneys sitting behind me who are
 
07:11:20.150 --> 07:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
practicing litigating attorneys I am no
 
07:11:22.070 --> 07:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
longer a practicing litigating attorney
 
07:11:25.730 --> 07:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
in that sense but what I will say is
 
07:11:28.788 --> 07:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
that the attorney-client privilege and
 
07:11:30.770 --> 07:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
the duty of confidentiality that an
 
07:11:33.110 --> 07:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
attorney has to his or her client it
 
07:11:36.410 --> 07:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't block the client from releasing
 
07:11:39.590 --> 07:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
legal advice if they chose to do so the
 
07:11:43.190 --> 07:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
client holds the privilege and so in
 
07:11:46.070 --> 07:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
some circumstances it's true that a
 
07:11:48.410 --> 07:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
municipality a corporation a private
 
07:11:52.490 --> 07:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
individual could choose to for whatever
 
07:11:55.128 --> 07:11:55.138 align:start position:0%
reason could choose to actually release
 
07:11:57.890 --> 07:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
or share legal advice but that is at
 
07:12:00.170 --> 07:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
their option it is not something that
 
07:12:03.230 --> 07:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
can or should be forced against them to
 
07:12:05.030 --> 07:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
release legal advice that they have
 
07:12:07.310 --> 07:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
received so I don't know if that touches
 
07:12:10.430 --> 07:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit upon your question there
 
07:12:11.930 --> 07:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
where you were asking about if there
 
07:12:13.910 --> 07:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
were some circumstances where it could
 
07:12:16.128 --> 07:12:16.138 align:start position:0%
be efficient or appropriate for legal
 
07:12:18.590 --> 07:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
advice to be disclosed I guess if I
 
07:12:20.750 --> 07:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
could follow up real quickly yeah I
 
07:12:23.330 --> 07:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
guess in terms of efficiency and a
 
07:12:25.610 --> 07:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
potential dispute or risk in mitigating
 
07:12:28.788 --> 07:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
risk and perhaps there's some uh maybe
 
07:12:30.890 --> 07:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
some other folks who are behind you can
 
07:12:32.930 --> 07:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
testify to this but in terms of giving
 
07:12:35.990 --> 07:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
Frank advice to a client that's
 
07:12:38.510 --> 07:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
protected in a way that may resolve a
 
07:12:38.520 --> 07:12:39.530 align:start position:0%
protected in a way that may resolve a
dispute

07:12:39.530 --> 07:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
07:12:42.890 --> 07:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
potentially or an issue in an efficient
 
07:12:46.730 --> 07:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
way that may not that may allow May
 
07:12:49.670 --> 07:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
avoid kind of the high risk high-cost
 
07:12:52.250 --> 07:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
scenarios that could potentially be
 
07:12:55.070 --> 07:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
behind a particular situation so in
 
07:12:56.868 --> 07:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
other words if if I could give Frank
 
07:13:00.350 --> 07:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
advice to my client about an issue and
 
07:13:02.330 --> 07:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
talk frankly about the risks the costs
 
07:13:05.090 --> 07:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
and so on it may in my view I guess I
 
07:13:06.530 --> 07:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
don't want to testify but I'm asking you
 
07:13:10.250 --> 07:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
could it potentially uh you know Make It
 
07:13:11.990 --> 07:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
capture some efficiencies in terms of
 
07:13:14.390 --> 07:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
how we might approach a situation that
 
07:13:16.670 --> 07:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
might actually cut costs or mitigate
 
07:13:20.150 --> 07:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
risk for for a municipality if I were an
 
07:13:22.430 --> 07:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
attorney I am an attorney but if I were
 
07:13:24.530 --> 07:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
an attorney giving legal advice to a
 
07:13:28.548 --> 07:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
municipality knowing that the legal
 
07:13:31.310 --> 07:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
advice could be forced to be disclosed
 
07:13:33.170 --> 07:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
through the right to know law
 
07:13:37.250 --> 07:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
it would give me pause about how Frank
 
07:13:40.310 --> 07:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
or how much to include in my written
 
07:13:42.650 --> 07:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
legal advice for fear that if it were
 
07:13:45.230 --> 07:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
disclosed it would jeopardize the
 
07:13:45.240 --> 07:13:46.850 align:start position:0%
disclosed it would jeopardize the
municipality

07:13:46.850 --> 07:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
07:13:49.070 --> 07:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
um and put them at at risk and this
 
07:13:50.090 --> 07:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
happens all the time where
 
07:13:52.548 --> 07:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities have a situation that
 
07:13:54.230 --> 07:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
they're Unsure how they should proceed
 
07:13:56.448 --> 07:13:56.458 align:start position:0%
whether they should proceed and they
 
07:13:58.190 --> 07:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
need to really lay out all the
 
07:14:00.590 --> 07:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
information to their attorney and get
 
07:14:03.350 --> 07:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
really Frank legal advice assessing the
 
07:14:06.230 --> 07:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
risks and the best Avenue to proceed and
 
07:14:08.090 --> 07:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
we would never want to chill that
 
07:14:09.890 --> 07:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
discourse and that advice that
 
07:14:11.930 --> 07:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
governments and municipalities receive
 
07:14:14.750 --> 07:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the risk that we run
 
07:14:19.310 --> 07:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:22.910 --> 07:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:25.490 --> 07:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
07:14:25.500 --> 07:14:29.510 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

07:14:29.510 --> 07:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:42.590 --> 07:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:44.448 --> 07:14:44.458 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
07:14:45.890 --> 07:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh thank you for taking
 
07:14:48.288 --> 07:14:48.298 align:start position:0%
the time to hear our testimony with
 
07:14:51.350 --> 07:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
respect to this I am also here uh in
 
07:14:54.948 --> 07:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 1073 which would remove
 
07:14:57.650 --> 07:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
the exemption uh I'm uh the City
 
07:15:00.110 --> 07:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
attorney for the city of Keene uh quite
 
07:15:01.968 --> 07:15:01.978 align:start position:0%
frankly I deal with right to know issues
 
07:15:04.610 --> 07:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh way more than I would like to and way
 
07:15:07.368 --> 07:15:07.378 align:start position:0%
more than I did 10 years ago
 
07:15:09.230 --> 07:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
um the attorney-client privilege in this
 
07:15:11.330 --> 07:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
context is absolutely critical to my
 
07:15:13.788 --> 07:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
ability to represent uh not only the
 
07:15:16.128 --> 07:15:16.138 align:start position:0%
city council for the city of Keene but
 
07:15:18.468 --> 07:15:18.478 align:start position:0%
also the numerous entities that fall
 
07:15:21.410 --> 07:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
under that not only our departments but
 
07:15:23.650 --> 07:15:23.660 align:start position:0%
also the agencies and the other
 
07:15:26.448 --> 07:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
administrative entities that we have
 
07:15:28.610 --> 07:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
created the attorney-client privilege
 
07:15:31.430 --> 07:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
allows me to have candid conversations
 
07:15:35.390 --> 07:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
and also to prepare information that I
 
07:15:38.208 --> 07:15:38.218 align:start position:0%
can distribute to my client with respect
 
07:15:39.890 --> 07:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
to a matter that may come before it to
 
07:15:41.270 --> 07:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
this question that was asked over here
 
07:15:43.490 --> 07:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of efficiencies it would become
 
07:15:46.850 --> 07:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
way less efficient in my office if I
 
07:15:49.010 --> 07:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
knew that the information that I Was
 
07:15:51.770 --> 07:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
preparing could be discoverable under a
 
07:15:53.948 --> 07:15:53.958 align:start position:0%
right to know request I would probably
 
07:15:57.650 --> 07:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
not create as many written documents as
 
07:15:59.628 --> 07:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
I do now and I would have more
 
07:16:02.510 --> 07:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
face-to-face meetings with everybody and
 
07:16:04.250 --> 07:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
that would certainly increase the cost
 
07:16:06.288 --> 07:16:06.298 align:start position:0%
to the community into the city to have
 
07:16:08.330 --> 07:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
to do that I'm sorry to have to tell you
 
07:16:09.770 --> 07:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
that but that would be the Practical
 
07:16:12.948 --> 07:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
effect of something like this as far as
 
07:16:15.890 --> 07:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
the issue about who the client is I hear
 
07:16:18.230 --> 07:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
some confusion on the committee and with
 
07:16:20.270 --> 07:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
some of the questions uh the client
 
07:16:22.490 --> 07:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
clients with all due respect to our
 
07:16:25.070 --> 07:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful citizens and residents from my
 
07:16:27.830 --> 07:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
perspective they are not the client if
 
07:16:29.868 --> 07:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
they were the client then everything
 
07:16:32.628 --> 07:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
that I do under my rules of Ethics would
 
07:16:35.750 --> 07:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
become an incredible problem it's not
 
07:16:37.850 --> 07:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
like we have a monolithic group of
 
07:16:39.770 --> 07:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
residents you know that would be sort of
 
07:16:42.670 --> 07:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
nice about they sue us we sue them
 
07:16:45.170 --> 07:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
sometimes we're in situations where we
 
07:16:46.670 --> 07:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
have one group of residents who are
 
07:16:48.350 --> 07:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to something that the zoning
 
07:16:49.490 --> 07:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
Board of adjustment did and another
 
07:16:51.590 --> 07:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
group of residents that is an absolute
 
07:16:54.650 --> 07:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
support for it and if I were subject to
 
07:16:56.930 --> 07:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
having to release the confidential
 
07:16:58.850 --> 07:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
information with respect to a right to
 
07:17:01.430 --> 07:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
no request that would do harm to one
 
07:17:03.770 --> 07:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
side or the other but I can assure you
 
07:17:05.390 --> 07:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
that there would be unhappy population
 
07:17:08.868 --> 07:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
in the city as a result of that the
 
07:17:11.090 --> 07:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
privilege is absolutely important to us
 
07:17:14.030 --> 07:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
as a matter of practicality one of the
 
07:17:16.128 --> 07:17:16.138 align:start position:0%
reasons why we came to the legislature
 
07:17:18.468 --> 07:17:18.478 align:start position:0%
after that Supreme Court decision which
 
07:17:20.628 --> 07:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
quite frankly was a shock to all of us
 
07:17:23.270 --> 07:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
and not necessary to the decision that
 
07:17:24.830 --> 07:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court issued in that case
 
07:17:27.830 --> 07:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
but when we came it was because we knew
 
07:17:31.670 --> 07:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
that otherwise the confidentiality rule
 
07:17:33.890 --> 07:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
as is being pointed out here does
 
07:17:35.868 --> 07:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
require a balancing test under the
 
07:17:38.330 --> 07:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
existing jurisprudence from our Supreme
 
07:17:41.150 --> 07:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
Court so I would have to as a practical
 
07:17:43.670 --> 07:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
matter again if I get a request the
 
07:17:45.708 --> 07:17:45.718 align:start position:0%
right to no request for information out
 
07:17:47.770 --> 07:17:47.780 align:start position:0%
of my office which I do
 
07:17:51.170 --> 07:17:51.180 align:start position:0%
fairly regularly I need to take a look
 
07:17:52.850 --> 07:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
at that and I need to look at the
 
07:17:54.468 --> 07:17:54.478 align:start position:0%
documents and everything else that's
 
07:17:57.590 --> 07:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
before me and I'm the one in the city of
 
07:18:00.048 --> 07:18:00.058 align:start position:0%
Keene working with some others who have
 
07:18:02.090 --> 07:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
the primary responsibility for doing
 
07:18:04.430 --> 07:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
that test and seeing whether there is
 
07:18:06.350 --> 07:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
whether there's a privacy interest
 
07:18:08.930 --> 07:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
whether the Public's interest is is in
 
07:18:11.628 --> 07:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
effect in balancing those out as a
 
07:18:13.368 --> 07:18:13.378 align:start position:0%
practical matter it's going to be very
 
07:18:15.830 --> 07:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
difficult for me to do that because I'm
 
07:18:18.110 --> 07:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
then reviewing whether I think there
 
07:18:19.610 --> 07:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
should be a privacy interest in the
 
07:18:21.468 --> 07:18:21.478 align:start position:0%
materials that I've created of course I
 
07:18:23.510 --> 07:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
am going to think that as an attorney
 
07:18:25.730 --> 07:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
with 30 years of practice it's hard not
 
07:18:28.190 --> 07:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
to think that at this point so as a
 
07:18:29.510 --> 07:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
practical matter I would have to go
 
07:18:31.548 --> 07:18:31.558 align:start position:0%
outside and get outside legal counsel
 
07:18:34.010 --> 07:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
and have legal counsel take a look at
 
07:18:35.448 --> 07:18:35.458 align:start position:0%
that for me and make that determination
 
07:18:37.250 --> 07:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
of course then you're in sort of the
 
07:18:39.230 --> 07:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
same problem because outside legal
 
07:18:40.850 --> 07:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
counsel is coming on board and they are
 
07:18:43.070 --> 07:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
representing the city of Keene through
 
07:18:45.590 --> 07:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
me with respect to this matter so it
 
07:18:47.628 --> 07:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
becomes an unending sort of circle at
 
07:18:48.468 --> 07:18:48.478 align:start position:0%
that point
 
07:18:52.990 --> 07:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
so I urge you uh please uh to uh to uh
 
07:18:57.288 --> 07:18:57.298 align:start position:0%
itl uh this bill and to allow us in the
 
07:18:59.448 --> 07:18:59.458 align:start position:0%
municipal sector as Municipal attorneys
 
07:19:01.850 --> 07:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
the same rights and privileges that
 
07:19:04.010 --> 07:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
apply to private sector attorneys thank
 
07:19:05.570 --> 07:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
you for your time and I'm happy to take
 
07:19:07.250 --> 07:19:07.260 align:start position:0%

part of my job is working with right to

know so I do understand the importance
 
07:20:31.368 --> 07:20:31.378 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire has

placed on openness and transparency in
government

07:20:35.150 --> 07:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
government
 
07:20:36.830 --> 07:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
but for as long as the right to know
 
07:20:38.750 --> 07:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
laws have been in place there have also
 
07:20:40.250 --> 07:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
been exemptions
 
07:20:42.410 --> 07:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
for example Consulting with legal
 
07:20:45.890 --> 07:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
counsel in person is not a meeting to
 
07:20:48.590 --> 07:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
which rsa91a even applies
 
07:20:51.048 --> 07:20:51.058 align:start position:0%
as for in governmental records there are
 
07:20:54.650 --> 07:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
exemptions under RSA 9185 and for
 
07:20:56.990 --> 07:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
decades these exemptions have been
 
07:20:58.730 --> 07:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
understood to include without
 
07:21:01.430 --> 07:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
qualification attorney-client privilege
 
07:21:04.490 --> 07:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
an attorney work product material until
 
07:21:06.530 --> 07:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
the Hampstead case that has been
 
07:21:09.350 --> 07:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
discussed came about
 
07:21:10.850 --> 07:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
when the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
07:21:12.770 --> 07:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
decided this case they imposed a
 
07:21:14.570 --> 07:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
balancing requirement on the
 
07:21:16.910 --> 07:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
communications of attorneys and their
 
07:21:18.788 --> 07:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
Municipal clients and in doing so
 
07:21:21.468 --> 07:21:21.478 align:start position:0%
watered down if not effectively
 
07:21:21.478 --> 07:21:23.208 align:start position:0%
watered down if not effectively
eliminated

07:21:23.208 --> 07:21:23.218 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
07:21:24.948 --> 07:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
those protections for governmental
 
07:21:28.190 --> 07:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
entities and public officials
 
07:21:30.830 --> 07:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
following this decision this legislature
 
07:21:33.830 --> 07:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
prudently acted fast to pass House Bill
 
07:21:35.810 --> 07:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
108 last year
 
07:21:38.990 --> 07:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
which in part amended RSA 91a5
 
07:21:41.390 --> 07:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
to explicitly exempt attorney-client
 
07:21:42.770 --> 07:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
privilege and attorney worked product
 
07:21:45.890 --> 07:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
materials from disclosure
 
07:21:48.948 --> 07:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1073 seeks to reverse this
 
07:21:52.070 --> 07:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:54.650 --> 07:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
now I want to be clear about why these
 
07:21:56.810 --> 07:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
Privileges and protections exist and
 
07:21:59.270 --> 07:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
what they cover and do not cover
 
07:22:02.390 --> 07:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
because hearing previous testimony it's
 
07:22:04.310 --> 07:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
my fear that this legislation is being
 
07:22:06.830 --> 07:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
prompted by misunderstanding about these
 
07:22:10.430 --> 07:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
doctrines which are really quite narrow
 
07:22:11.750 --> 07:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
so I'll start with the attorney-client
 
07:22:11.760 --> 07:22:13.250 align:start position:0%
so I'll start with the attorney-client
privilege

07:22:13.250 --> 07:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
privilege
 
07:22:14.628 --> 07:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the attorney-client
 
07:22:16.850 --> 07:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
privilege is to facilitate the rendition
 
07:22:18.288 --> 07:22:18.298 align:start position:0%
of legal advice
 
07:22:20.208 --> 07:22:20.218 align:start position:0%
create a secure channel of communication
 
07:22:23.150 --> 07:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
so a client can be candid without fear
 
07:22:24.770 --> 07:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
of communication being used against the
 
07:22:24.780 --> 07:22:25.968 align:start position:0%
of communication being used against the
speaker

07:22:25.968 --> 07:22:25.978 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
07:22:28.310 --> 07:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rule of evidence 502 makes
 
07:22:30.830 --> 07:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
clear that a client qualifying for the
 
07:22:33.770 --> 07:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
privilege includes a public officer or
 
07:22:36.708 --> 07:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
Corporation or other organization entity
 
07:22:40.250 --> 07:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
either public or private
 
07:22:43.310 --> 07:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
this privilege benefits the public by
 
07:22:44.868 --> 07:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
allowing public bodies to get sound
 
07:22:46.190 --> 07:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
legal advice
 
07:22:48.530 --> 07:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
this includes legal advice pointing out
 
07:22:50.930 --> 07:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
risks and keeping the public body in
 
07:22:53.330 --> 07:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
compliance with the law
 
07:22:55.968 --> 07:22:55.978 align:start position:0%
the importance of confidentiality is so
 
07:22:57.530 --> 07:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
high that there is an ethical
 
07:22:59.690 --> 07:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
responsibility of lawyers to maintain
 
07:22:59.700 --> 07:23:01.490 align:start position:0%
responsibility of lawyers to maintain
confidentiality

07:23:01.490 --> 07:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
07:23:04.010 --> 07:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
will 1.6 of the New Hampshire rules of
 
07:23:06.288 --> 07:23:06.298 align:start position:0%
professional conduct imposes an ethical
 
07:23:08.930 --> 07:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility on all attorneys to keep
 
07:23:10.670 --> 07:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
confident information relating to
 
07:23:12.890 --> 07:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
representation of a client
 
07:23:14.750 --> 07:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
in the comments of the rule the American
 
07:23:17.110 --> 07:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
Bar Association explains
 
07:23:20.030 --> 07:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle in the client law
 
07:23:20.040 --> 07:23:21.288 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle in the client law
relationship

07:23:21.288 --> 07:23:21.298 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
07:23:23.930 --> 07:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
is that is in the absence
 
07:23:26.390 --> 07:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the client's informed consent
 
07:23:29.110 --> 07:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
the lawyer must not reveal information
 
07:23:31.968 --> 07:23:31.978 align:start position:0%
relating to the representation
 
07:23:34.310 --> 07:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
this contributes to the trust that is
 
07:23:36.288 --> 07:23:36.298 align:start position:0%
the Hallmark of the client War
 
07:23:36.298 --> 07:23:37.490 align:start position:0%
the Hallmark of the client War
relationship

07:23:37.490 --> 07:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
07:23:39.830 --> 07:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
the client is thereby encouraged to
 
07:23:42.590 --> 07:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
communicate fully and frankly with the
 
07:23:44.930 --> 07:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
lawyer the lawyer needs this information
 
07:23:47.330 --> 07:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
to represent the client effectively
 
07:23:47.340 --> 07:23:49.310 align:start position:0%
to represent the client effectively
effectively

07:23:49.310 --> 07:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
07:23:51.830 --> 07:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
and to advise the client
 
07:23:54.230 --> 07:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
s come to lawyers in order to determine
 
07:23:56.628 --> 07:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
their rights and what is in the complex
 
07:23:59.270 --> 07:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
of laws and regulations deemed to be
 
07:24:02.510 --> 07:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:05.150 --> 07:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1073 will deny this
 
07:24:06.650 --> 07:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle to governmental
 
07:24:09.170 --> 07:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
clients the candid communication that is
 
07:24:10.670 --> 07:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
a Hallmark of the client lawyer
 
07:24:12.350 --> 07:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
relationship will be denied to
 
07:24:13.968 --> 07:24:13.978 align:start position:0%
governmental bodies
 
07:24:16.310 --> 07:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
there should be no concern that the
 
07:24:18.410 --> 07:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
current exception is overbroad
 
07:24:20.270 --> 07:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
because the attorney client privilege is
 
07:24:21.890 --> 07:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
not absolute
 
07:24:24.288 --> 07:24:24.298 align:start position:0%
the privilege only arises when there's a
 
07:24:27.230 --> 07:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
communication that is confidential and
 
07:24:28.910 --> 07:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
made for purposes of seeking or
 
07:24:31.910 --> 07:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
receiving legal advice
 
07:24:34.010 --> 07:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
another limitation on the privilege is
 
07:24:36.170 --> 07:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
the crime fraud exception
 
07:24:37.968 --> 07:24:37.978 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will of evidence 502
 
07:24:40.368 --> 07:24:40.378 align:start position:0%
withdraws the privilege entirely when
 
07:24:42.048 --> 07:24:42.058 align:start position:0%
the services of the lawyer are sought or
 
07:24:44.390 --> 07:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
obtained to enable or Aid anyone to
 
07:24:46.670 --> 07:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
commit or plan to commit in the future
 
07:24:48.708 --> 07:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
with a client new or reasonably should
 
07:24:50.868 --> 07:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
have known to be a crime or fraud
 
07:24:54.650 --> 07:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
so the 91a exemption would not apply
 
07:24:56.390 --> 07:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
if the communication seeks the Attorney
 
07:24:58.368 --> 07:24:58.378 align:start position:0%
Services and assisting with crime or
 
07:24:58.378 --> 07:24:59.390 align:start position:0%
Services and assisting with crime or
fraud

07:24:59.390 --> 07:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
07:25:01.968 --> 07:25:01.978 align:start position:0%
another limitation is that the privilege
 
07:25:04.788 --> 07:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
only applies for so-called control group
 
07:25:07.430 --> 07:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
in cases of public corporations
 
07:25:09.890 --> 07:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
control group test is the most
 
07:25:12.770 --> 07:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
restrictive of methods used to determine
 
07:25:14.090 --> 07:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
the scope of the attorney-client
 
07:25:16.430 --> 07:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
privilege it limits the privilege to
 
07:25:18.048 --> 07:25:18.058 align:start position:0%
Communications from persons in the
 
07:25:20.090 --> 07:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
organization who have the authority to
 
07:25:22.610 --> 07:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
mold organizational policy or to take
 
07:25:24.230 --> 07:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
action in accordance with the lawyer's
 
07:25:24.240 --> 07:25:25.368 align:start position:0%
action in accordance with the lawyer's
advice

07:25:25.368 --> 07:25:25.378 align:start position:0%
advice
 
07:25:28.010 --> 07:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
in short the attorney-client privilege
 
07:25:31.368 --> 07:25:31.378 align:start position:0%
is in fact a narrow Doctrine with
 
07:25:33.230 --> 07:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
existing limitations to prevent its
 
07:25:35.390 --> 07:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
abuse or misuse
 
07:25:38.030 --> 07:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
repealing the current 91a exemption will
 
07:25:39.770 --> 07:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
only harm the ability of our public
 
07:25:39.780 --> 07:25:40.910 align:start position:0%
only harm the ability of our public
bodies

07:25:40.910 --> 07:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
07:25:42.230 --> 07:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
07:25:44.390 --> 07:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
from the three branches of government to
 
07:25:57.590 --> 07:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:57.600 --> 07:26:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

07:26:00.590 --> 07:26:00.600 align:start position:0%

with product material like the

attorney-client privilege the work
 
07:26:40.490 --> 07:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
product Doctrine is narrow
 
07:26:41.990 --> 07:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
attorney work product immunity
 
07:26:44.990 --> 07:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
ordinarily covers material prepared by a

lawyer in reasonable anticipation of

the lawyer
 
07:26:55.670 --> 07:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
this protection attaches at the point in
 
07:26:58.368 --> 07:26:58.378 align:start position:0%
time when litigation is in progress or
 
07:27:00.770 --> 07:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
reasonably anticipated by the lawyer at
 
07:27:03.048 --> 07:27:03.058 align:start position:0%
the time the material was prepared
 
07:27:04.730 --> 07:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
as explained by the United States
 
07:27:07.490 --> 07:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court at its core the work
 
07:27:09.288 --> 07:27:09.298 align:start position:0%
product Doctrine shelters the mental
 
07:27:11.448 --> 07:27:11.458 align:start position:0%
process of the attorney providing a
 
07:27:13.250 --> 07:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
privileged area within which she can
 
07:27:17.090 --> 07:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
analyze and prepare her client's case
 
07:27:19.190 --> 07:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
eliminating this protection would
 
07:27:20.750 --> 07:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
significantly disadvantage government
 
07:27:23.570 --> 07:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
entities in any litigation opening the
 
07:27:25.490 --> 07:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
plans and Analysis of their attorney to
 
07:27:27.770 --> 07:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
public disclosure
 
07:27:30.468 --> 07:27:30.478 align:start position:0%
withdrawing work product protection in
 
07:27:33.048 --> 07:27:33.058 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a means that every current and
 
07:27:34.910 --> 07:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
future litigant opposing any
 
07:27:37.850 --> 07:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
governmental body can file a 91a request
 
07:27:40.730 --> 07:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
to obtain through 91a what they cannot
 
07:27:47.030 --> 07:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:49.670 --> 07:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately if the current exception is
 
07:27:52.250 --> 07:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
repealed legal advice will still be
 
07:27:54.708 --> 07:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
needed by municipalities but emailing or
 
07:27:56.390 --> 07:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
letter writing will pose a risk of
 
07:27:58.730 --> 07:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
public disclosure and so will likely be
 
07:28:00.288 --> 07:28:00.298 align:start position:0%
avoided in favor of phone calls and
 
07:28:00.298 --> 07:28:01.610 align:start position:0%
avoided in favor of phone calls and
meetings

07:28:01.610 --> 07:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
07:28:03.650 --> 07:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
there will be little or no greater
 
07:28:05.990 --> 07:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
public window into these communications
 
07:28:08.570 --> 07:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
this legislation will not result in the
 
07:28:10.070 --> 07:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
communication between a government
 
07:28:12.468 --> 07:28:12.478 align:start position:0%
attorney and the entity becoming
 
07:28:14.150 --> 07:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
publicly available
 
07:28:17.090 --> 07:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
those records simply will not exist
 
07:28:19.670 --> 07:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
in the meantime public bodies will see a
 
07:28:22.310 --> 07:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
flood of 91a requests seeking past
 
07:28:24.468 --> 07:28:24.478 align:start position:0%
current and future attorney-client
 
07:28:24.478 --> 07:28:26.090 align:start position:0%
current and future attorney-client
communications

07:28:26.090 --> 07:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
communications
 
07:28:27.948 --> 07:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
the attorney-client privilege and work
 
07:28:30.650 --> 07:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
product protections are essential to an
 
07:28:32.330 --> 07:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
effective and efficient attorney-client
 
07:28:32.340 --> 07:28:33.468 align:start position:0%
effective and efficient attorney-client
relationship

07:28:33.468 --> 07:28:33.478 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
07:28:35.448 --> 07:28:35.458 align:start position:0%
it is essential that these protections
 
07:28:37.368 --> 07:28:37.378 align:start position:0%
are maintained for governmental entities
 
07:28:39.110 --> 07:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
and their lawyers
 
07:28:40.730 --> 07:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
the public benefits from these
 
07:28:42.350 --> 07:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
protections and the current 91a
 
07:28:42.360 --> 07:28:43.490 align:start position:0%
protections and the current 91a
exemption

07:28:43.490 --> 07:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
07:28:45.770 --> 07:28:45.780 align:start position:0%
because they ensure the government gets
 
07:28:48.288 --> 07:28:48.298 align:start position:0%
the best possible legal advice
 
07:28:50.208 --> 07:28:50.218 align:start position:0%
but more than happy to take any
 
07:28:50.218 --> 07:28:51.230 align:start position:0%
but more than happy to take any
questions

07:28:51.230 --> 07:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:28:56.570 --> 07:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:59.208 --> 07:28:59.218 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony

07:29:11.090 --> 07:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
it would be a lot easier if you just
 
07:29:12.650 --> 07:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
sent them to us electronically however
 
07:29:14.448 --> 07:29:14.458 align:start position:0%

I have just one more pink card and that
 
07:30:47.628 --> 07:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:49.368 --> 07:30:49.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
07:30:51.170 --> 07:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
committee it's my pleasure to be before
 
07:30:54.590 --> 07:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee where I cut my teeth
 
07:31:00.708 --> 07:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:00.718 --> 07:31:01.368 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:31:01.368 --> 07:31:01.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:31:03.590 --> 07:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
the right to know law is something that
 
07:31:05.628 --> 07:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
is is very important to me as a matter
 
07:31:08.030 --> 07:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
of fact the father of the right to know
 
07:31:10.910 --> 07:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
law was John M bedner from the town of
 
07:31:13.010 --> 07:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
Hudson and I served on the board of
 
07:31:14.570 --> 07:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
selectman in Hudson
 
07:31:17.150 --> 07:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
with Mr bedner it was so important to
 
07:31:17.160 --> 07:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
with Mr bedner it was so important to
him

07:31:17.990 --> 07:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
him
 
07:31:20.868 --> 07:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
that actually the fact that he is the
 
07:31:23.270 --> 07:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
father of the right to know law is
 
07:31:26.830 --> 07:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
inscribed on his tombstone in Hudson
 
07:31:30.110 --> 07:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
and I have always taken pride in the
 
07:31:32.868 --> 07:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
fact that I come from the town that
 
07:31:35.448 --> 07:31:35.458 align:start position:0%
elected the man who gave us the right to
 
07:31:36.788 --> 07:31:36.798 align:start position:0%
know law
 
07:31:40.010 --> 07:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
I have walked out of a number of
 
07:31:42.948 --> 07:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
meetings over the years because I felt
 
07:31:45.310 --> 07:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
the right to know law was being violated
 
07:31:48.770 --> 07:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in the time times when I
 
07:31:50.690 --> 07:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
did that on the board of Selectmen none
 
07:31:52.010 --> 07:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
of the press seemed to be very
 
07:31:54.110 --> 07:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
interested in that fact and I've never
 
07:31:56.270 --> 07:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
had the financial resources of the time
 
07:31:59.990 --> 07:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
to take the town to court I've also more
 
07:32:03.430 --> 07:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
recently walked out of meetings
 
07:32:06.650 --> 07:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
that I serve on as a result of having
 
07:32:09.468 --> 07:32:09.478 align:start position:0%
been speaker and as commissioner
 
07:32:11.690 --> 07:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
and I'm very thankful that the
 
07:32:14.448 --> 07:32:14.458 align:start position:0%
legislature finally gave us the ability
 
07:32:17.510 --> 07:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
to record our objection and stay in the
 
07:32:20.628 --> 07:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
meeting because previously to that I had
 
07:32:22.730 --> 07:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
to simply walk out and then have no idea
 
07:32:24.230 --> 07:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
what was going on
 
07:32:28.190 --> 07:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
so I to that one board that I serve on
 
07:32:30.048 --> 07:32:30.058 align:start position:0%
now I've actually brought the Attorney
 
07:32:34.610 --> 07:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
General in to give a lesson on the right
 
07:32:37.548 --> 07:32:37.558 align:start position:0%
to no law but it is a difficult law to
 
07:32:40.010 --> 07:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
navigate at times it's still not clear
 
07:32:42.948 --> 07:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
to me after actually having worked with
 
07:32:44.930 --> 07:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
it for all these years because there are
 
07:32:48.230 --> 07:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
so many so many questions but I am in
 
07:32:51.770 --> 07:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
opposition to this this bill
 
07:32:55.730 --> 07:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
I am sympathetic
 
07:32:59.208 --> 07:32:59.218 align:start position:0%
to to the concerns of those who want to
 
07:33:01.850 --> 07:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
see more information public because I do
 
07:33:03.170 --> 07:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
as well
 
07:33:03.180 --> 07:33:04.670 align:start position:0%
as well
but

07:33:04.670 --> 07:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:33:04.680 --> 07:33:05.330 align:start position:0%
but
um

07:33:05.330 --> 07:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:07.670 --> 07:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that this is is the
 
07:33:07.680 --> 07:33:09.230 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that this is is the
solution

07:33:09.230 --> 07:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
solution
 
07:33:12.230 --> 07:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
to to a problem really and and I I wish
 
07:33:14.628 --> 07:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
that I had known about the court case
 
07:33:16.788 --> 07:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
that seems to have brought upon the
 
07:33:18.530 --> 07:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
amendment last year and I really didn't
 
07:33:21.288 --> 07:33:21.298 align:start position:0%
understand the the narrative
 
07:33:23.690 --> 07:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
I don't think that repealing this will
 
07:33:25.968 --> 07:33:25.978 align:start position:0%
be the end of the issue because it's
 
07:33:28.070 --> 07:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's a one of the most ancient
 
07:33:31.270 --> 07:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
principles in common law to have
 
07:33:34.190 --> 07:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege and so I think
 
07:33:37.070 --> 07:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
simple repeal of it where it's already
 
07:33:40.788 --> 07:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
existed in lar and it's
 
07:33:44.448 --> 07:33:44.458 align:start position:0%
a quick review of the annotations uh in
 
07:33:48.310 --> 07:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
the Irish rsas show that as far back as
 
07:33:52.910 --> 07:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
2005 the Supreme Court is referred to
 
07:33:56.330 --> 07:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
the exemption under confidentiality so I
 
07:33:58.128 --> 07:33:58.138 align:start position:0%
don't think that changes and that's been
 
07:34:00.468 --> 07:34:00.478 align:start position:0%
noticed before but I I'm here to tell
 
07:34:02.390 --> 07:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
you as the commissioner of the
 
07:34:04.910 --> 07:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture that the
 
07:34:06.708 --> 07:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
attorney client
 
07:34:09.350 --> 07:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
work product is very important to us as
 
07:34:13.070 --> 07:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
we're developing responses to many many
 
07:34:15.288 --> 07:34:15.298 align:start position:0%
things we do whether they're
 
07:34:18.350 --> 07:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
Administrative Hearings or responses to
 
07:34:21.650 --> 07:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
right to know requests or any number of
 
07:34:23.628 --> 07:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
things or just questions as we're moving
 
07:34:23.638 --> 07:34:24.530 align:start position:0%
things or just questions as we're moving
along

07:34:24.530 --> 07:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
along
 
07:34:27.890 --> 07:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
now it was previously stated and it was
 
07:34:29.510 --> 07:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
a thought that I already have that all
 
07:34:31.430 --> 07:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
this is going to really do is cost the
 
07:34:35.208 --> 07:34:35.218 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a lot more money if this were
 
07:34:35.218 --> 07:34:36.190 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a lot more money if this were
to

07:34:36.190 --> 07:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:34:39.110 --> 07:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
take place and be upheld by by the
 
07:34:41.628 --> 07:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
courts that there were no longer any
 
07:34:43.968 --> 07:34:43.978 align:start position:0%
privilege as to work product because
 
07:34:46.490 --> 07:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
that would mean that we would all be on
 
07:34:49.670 --> 07:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
the phone we would all have meetings and
 
07:34:52.850 --> 07:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
instead of sending a quickie email with
 
07:34:54.708 --> 07:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
the document that we're asking the
 
07:34:57.410 --> 07:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
question about that really couldn't take
 
07:35:00.590 --> 07:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
place anymore because a lot of times we
 
07:35:02.690 --> 07:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
just we don't know what the correct
 
07:35:05.570 --> 07:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
response is and so we've got to make
 
07:35:07.850 --> 07:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
sure that we're asking the right
 
07:35:10.128 --> 07:35:10.138 align:start position:0%
questions so that we can give the right
 
07:35:12.110 --> 07:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
answers to the people that we're
 
07:35:15.948 --> 07:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
responding to and and you can't do that
 
07:35:19.070 --> 07:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
and then have that work product be out
 
07:35:20.810 --> 07:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
there and people saying well see the
 
07:35:22.070 --> 07:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner said well no the
 
07:35:24.288 --> 07:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
commissioner said this would be my
 
07:35:24.298 --> 07:35:26.208 align:start position:0%
commissioner said this would be my
response

07:35:26.208 --> 07:35:26.218 align:start position:0%
response
 
07:35:27.948 --> 07:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
what do you think
 
07:35:29.990 --> 07:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then know you're all wet and quite
 
07:35:31.490 --> 07:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
frankly over the years one of the things
 
07:35:34.490 --> 07:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
whether whatever position it's been I
 
07:35:36.890 --> 07:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
have a tendency to want to say more than
 
07:35:40.010 --> 07:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
is probably good for me or the community
 
07:35:43.490 --> 07:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
or the department and so the attorneys
 
07:35:46.490 --> 07:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
are good in in keeping me in check and
 
07:35:48.110 --> 07:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
making sure that I don't
 
07:35:52.250 --> 07:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
bring liability upon the state or the
 
07:35:52.260 --> 07:35:53.170 align:start position:0%
bring liability upon the state or the
town

07:35:53.170 --> 07:35:53.180 align:start position:0%
town
 
07:35:55.610 --> 07:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
in those capacities because I was a
 
07:35:57.830 --> 07:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
selectman for 17 years and was the chair
 
07:36:00.230 --> 07:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
numerous times over that that period of
 
07:36:00.240 --> 07:36:01.190 align:start position:0%
numerous times over that that period of
time

07:36:01.190 --> 07:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
07:36:04.368 --> 07:36:04.378 align:start position:0%
so I understand the frustration
 
07:36:06.170 --> 07:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that the court
 
07:36:09.350 --> 07:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
said in in 2005
 
07:36:13.128 --> 07:36:13.138 align:start position:0%
is if it does not serve a purpose of
 
07:36:16.850 --> 07:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
what its government is up to the
 
07:36:19.310 --> 07:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
disclosure will not be warranted under
 
07:36:21.770 --> 07:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
the right to no law so in other words
 
07:36:24.170 --> 07:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
just because you want to know
 
07:36:26.810 --> 07:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily give you the right
 
07:36:28.490 --> 07:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
to know
 
07:36:31.910 --> 07:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
now we we know that the courts have also
 
07:36:31.920 --> 07:36:32.810 align:start position:0%
now we we know that the courts have also
said

07:36:32.810 --> 07:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
said
 
07:36:35.030 --> 07:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't matter why you want to
 
07:36:37.850 --> 07:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
know you may have the right to know but
 
07:36:39.468 --> 07:36:39.478 align:start position:0%
what they've what they've said in this
 
07:36:42.770 --> 07:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
is that there are some things that need
 
07:36:44.628 --> 07:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
to be kept
 
07:36:47.150 --> 07:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
private if you will and in this case
 
07:36:50.208 --> 07:36:50.218 align:start position:0%
between the attorney and the client and
 
07:36:51.650 --> 07:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm here and I guess I'm the only
 
07:36:55.150 --> 07:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
one so far who's been here as a client
 
07:36:58.010 --> 07:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
saying that this would this would have a
 
07:37:00.590 --> 07:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on our ability to do our
 
07:37:02.270 --> 07:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
job and the other thing is my memory
 
07:37:04.368 --> 07:37:04.378 align:start position:0%
isn't as good as it used to be
 
07:37:07.128 --> 07:37:07.138 align:start position:0%
so if everything that I'm getting from
 
07:37:10.730 --> 07:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
the AG's office is verbal
 
07:37:12.708 --> 07:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to remember it all
 
07:37:14.868 --> 07:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
correctly and I think it's important and
 
07:37:16.730 --> 07:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
it should be important to all of you as
 
07:37:19.310 --> 07:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
legislators that when I take an official
 
07:37:21.230 --> 07:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
act on behalf of the State of New
 
07:37:24.110 --> 07:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I get it right and if I can't
 
07:37:26.390 --> 07:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
have that in writing and have that
 
07:37:28.368 --> 07:37:28.378 align:start position:0%
discussion in writing then I will tell
 
07:37:30.048 --> 07:37:30.058 align:start position:0%
you right now the chances are I'm going
 
07:37:32.270 --> 07:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
to get some things wrong and is that
 
07:37:35.208 --> 07:37:35.218 align:start position:0%
what you really want I hope not I hope
 
07:37:37.250 --> 07:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
you you want all of us who are
 
07:37:40.010 --> 07:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
representing you and uh in the
 
07:37:41.810 --> 07:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
government in general to get things
 
07:37:45.288 --> 07:37:45.298 align:start position:0%
right so I definitely want
 
07:37:47.150 --> 07:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
as much information out there as
 
07:37:47.160 --> 07:37:48.230 align:start position:0%
as much information out there as
possible

07:37:48.230 --> 07:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
possible
 
07:37:51.410 --> 07:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
but I want it to be information that is
 
07:37:54.170 --> 07:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
is useful and is right and that just
 
07:37:56.270 --> 07:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
because I have a a question that I'm
 
07:37:58.788 --> 07:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
asking that question should not
 
07:38:01.368 --> 07:38:01.378 align:start position:0%
necessarily be out there for the whole
 
07:38:04.250 --> 07:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
world to see
 
07:38:05.690 --> 07:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
um and so I'd be glad to answer any
 
07:38:08.090 --> 07:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
questions and I appreciate your time
 
07:38:10.548 --> 07:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
do we have questions
 
07:38:10.558 --> 07:38:12.830 align:start position:0%
do we have questions
Sylvia

07:38:12.830 --> 07:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
Sylvia
 
07:38:14.090 --> 07:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
07:38:15.890 --> 07:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:38:17.030 --> 07:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
07:38:18.770 --> 07:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
this seems to have come about because of
 
07:38:23.650 --> 07:38:23.660 align:start position:0%
this uh Court ruling and Ms odellano
 
07:38:27.230 --> 07:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
stated that we had previously a lot of
 
07:38:30.350 --> 07:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
things were covered as confidential so
 
07:38:33.468 --> 07:38:33.478 align:start position:0%
we operated reasonably well it's always
 
07:38:35.270 --> 07:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
bumpy with 91a
 
07:38:37.390 --> 07:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
so is it really
 
07:38:42.170 --> 07:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
necessary to keep this in statute well
 
07:38:44.090 --> 07:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
you know I've asked myself that question
 
07:38:47.930 --> 07:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
and in all my years as a as a legislator
 
07:38:50.448 --> 07:38:50.458 align:start position:0%
I've I've learned that when the
 
07:38:53.150 --> 07:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislature takes an action it's
 
07:38:55.910 --> 07:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
presumed to have taken an action with
 
07:38:55.920 --> 07:38:57.708 align:start position:0%
presumed to have taken an action with
purpose

07:38:57.708 --> 07:38:57.718 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
07:39:00.890 --> 07:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
so while I would feel that there
 
07:39:03.530 --> 07:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
probably wasn't a good reason although I
 
07:39:05.330 --> 07:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
had admitted I don't know the details of
 
07:39:07.670 --> 07:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
the case it was put in there by the
 
07:39:11.510 --> 07:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislature so taking that out is also
 
07:39:13.730 --> 07:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
an action which is probably going to
 
07:39:16.490 --> 07:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
send the message that we mean what we
 
07:39:19.070 --> 07:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
say and that the work products are no
 
07:39:21.410 --> 07:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
longer confidential now I do believe
 
07:39:23.810 --> 07:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
that because this is common law of the
 
07:39:26.270 --> 07:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
United States and that attorney-client
 
07:39:30.230 --> 07:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
privilege is very very important and
 
07:39:33.128 --> 07:39:33.138 align:start position:0%
very sacred that this would be litigated
 
07:39:35.708 --> 07:39:35.718 align:start position:0%
and that you're going to make a lot of
 
07:39:38.868 --> 07:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
attorneys a lot of money by taking it
 
07:39:41.510 --> 07:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
out and you're going to cost in a lot of
 
07:39:45.350 --> 07:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
cases a lot of taxpayers a lot of money
 
07:39:49.548 --> 07:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
so if if you're going to do this I I
 
07:39:53.770 --> 07:39:53.780 align:start position:0%
would ask that you very much consider
 
07:39:56.690 --> 07:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
those things and particularly the issue
 
07:39:56.700 --> 07:39:57.468 align:start position:0%
those things and particularly the issue
of

07:39:57.468 --> 07:39:57.478 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:39:59.208 --> 07:39:59.218 align:start position:0%
you know is this a better way to
 
07:40:01.548 --> 07:40:01.558 align:start position:0%
communicate with attorneys and is this
 
07:40:03.288 --> 07:40:03.298 align:start position:0%
going to be litigated
 
07:40:07.070 --> 07:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
if you take it out because I think as
 
07:40:09.650 --> 07:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
as an elected not an elected official as
 
07:40:12.830 --> 07:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
a a commissioner
 
07:40:15.288 --> 07:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm going to defer to the
 
07:40:17.230 --> 07:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office but my first
 
07:40:19.968 --> 07:40:19.978 align:start position:0%
response is going to say okay the
 
07:40:22.150 --> 07:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
legislature has told me that every time
 
07:40:27.650 --> 07:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
I have a correspondence about uh
 
07:40:29.510 --> 07:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
um an issue with the Attorney General's
 
07:40:33.230 --> 07:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
office that's now subject to 91a
 
07:40:33.240 --> 07:40:34.190 align:start position:0%
office that's now subject to 91a
um

07:40:34.190 --> 07:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:40:37.190 --> 07:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
that would be my my inclination and I'm
 
07:40:41.090 --> 07:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
not sure that that's right so I would
 
07:40:42.770 --> 07:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
ask you to be very very careful about
 
07:40:46.788 --> 07:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
this and be very clear about what it is
 
07:40:50.448 --> 07:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
you intend to do what you intend to be
 
07:40:53.030 --> 07:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
confidential and what you think should
 
07:40:55.430 --> 07:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
be public because I'm certainly confused
 
07:40:57.468 --> 07:40:57.478 align:start position:0%
and I'm the one who's got to live on one
 
07:40:58.788 --> 07:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
of the ones who has to live under this
 
07:41:01.190 --> 07:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
well I believe it's a follow-up thank
 
07:41:02.930 --> 07:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking a follow-up
 
07:41:05.090 --> 07:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
so you've been in the legislature for
 
07:41:08.090 --> 07:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
quite a long time or you had been
 
07:41:08.100 --> 07:41:09.048 align:start position:0%
quite a long time or you had been
um

07:41:09.048 --> 07:41:09.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:41:11.330 --> 07:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
I don't imagine you recall when this
 
07:41:13.368 --> 07:41:13.378 align:start position:0%
original confidentiality was put into
 
07:41:15.048 --> 07:41:15.058 align:start position:0%
the law whether or not there was any
 
07:41:16.968 --> 07:41:16.978 align:start position:0%
controversy or uh
 
07:41:19.190 --> 07:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
discussion over whether or not it was uh
 
07:41:20.990 --> 07:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
well the section that you're you're
 
07:41:23.990 --> 07:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
referring to that's to be repealed
 
07:41:26.750 --> 07:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I only learned today that it
 
07:41:29.628 --> 07:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
was just put in as I was trying to do a
 
07:41:31.610 --> 07:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
little bit of research and and saw that
 
07:41:34.128 --> 07:41:34.138 align:start position:0%
it's actually not in the printed rsas
 
07:41:37.730 --> 07:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
yet that it's only online so it's very
 
07:41:37.740 --> 07:41:39.548 align:start position:0%
yet that it's only online so it's very
recent

07:41:39.548 --> 07:41:39.558 align:start position:0%
recent
 
07:41:43.128 --> 07:41:43.138 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't know why it why it was
 
07:41:48.170 --> 07:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
put in if I may I I was kind of thinking
 
07:41:50.448 --> 07:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
back toys and I didn't write down the uh
 
07:41:53.390 --> 07:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
the number that was previously and um
 
07:41:56.930 --> 07:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
Miss ortolano quoted the uh the section
 
07:41:59.650 --> 07:41:59.660 align:start position:0%
it's from which previously had
 
07:42:02.750 --> 07:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
confidential records protected and I
 
07:42:04.430 --> 07:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
would imagine that there was must have
 
07:42:06.770 --> 07:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
been some legislative intent that went
 
07:42:08.750 --> 07:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
along with that that that could be I
 
07:42:12.230 --> 07:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
mean I do not remember a time in my life
 
07:42:15.170 --> 07:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
when that wasn't in there
 
07:42:18.708 --> 07:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
um though their confidentiality has in
 
07:42:21.410 --> 07:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
my 41 years as a public official has
 
07:42:26.750 --> 07:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:28.788 --> 07:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
07:42:31.310 --> 07:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lorenzo
 
07:42:33.170 --> 07:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
07:42:35.570 --> 07:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
um and thank you Mr Jasper for taking my
 
07:42:35.580 --> 07:42:36.770 align:start position:0%
um and thank you Mr Jasper for taking my
question

07:42:36.770 --> 07:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:42:38.990 --> 07:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm just feeling a little bit uneasy
 
07:42:40.850 --> 07:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
because this feels like there's a
 
07:42:43.128 --> 07:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
disconnect between what the Supreme
 
07:42:47.208 --> 07:42:47.218 align:start position:0%
Court decided on this issue and what the
 
07:42:49.250 --> 07:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
statute says
 
07:42:51.650 --> 07:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
um and how is that settled
 
07:42:54.170 --> 07:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
Well normally that is settled by by the
 
07:42:56.750 --> 07:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
legislature unfortunately I have not
 
07:43:00.048 --> 07:43:00.058 align:start position:0%
read that that case
 
07:43:02.570 --> 07:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like there was a
 
07:43:04.788 --> 07:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
conflict between two
 
07:43:08.690 --> 07:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
two clients of the same attorney uh and
 
07:43:11.868 --> 07:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
the court had to make a decision
 
07:43:14.208 --> 07:43:14.218 align:start position:0%
rarely is it a good idea in my opinion
 
07:43:16.868 --> 07:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
to pass a law because of
 
07:43:19.610 --> 07:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
one one case that may have limited
 
07:43:22.190 --> 07:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
application and I I'm totally at a
 
07:43:25.310 --> 07:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
disadvantage here my my only concern is
 
07:43:28.490 --> 07:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
that by totally taking this out there is
 
07:43:30.708 --> 07:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
going to be the feeling that all right
 
07:43:34.010 --> 07:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
now confidentiality is gone entirely and
 
07:43:36.410 --> 07:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to be litigating this for an
 
07:43:36.420 --> 07:43:37.490 align:start position:0%
we're going to be litigating this for an
extreme

07:43:37.490 --> 07:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
07:43:39.770 --> 07:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
an extreme extent for a period of time
 
07:43:41.990 --> 07:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
and in the interim there's going to be
 
07:43:46.788 --> 07:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:51.048 --> 07:43:51.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:56.990 --> 07:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:57.000 --> 07:43:59.570 align:start position:0%
 
commissioner

07:43:59.570 --> 07:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
07:44:01.310 --> 07:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
having had your experience in the
 
07:44:03.410 --> 07:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
legislature though and your experience
 
07:44:05.570 --> 07:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
in town government
 
07:44:07.430 --> 07:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
was it
 
07:44:10.128 --> 07:44:10.138 align:start position:0%
up until the recent court decision was
 
07:44:10.138 --> 07:44:11.390 align:start position:0%
up until the recent court decision was
it

07:44:11.390 --> 07:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:44:13.910 --> 07:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
generally understood
 
07:44:17.030 --> 07:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
that attorney-client Communications were
 
07:44:17.040 --> 07:44:18.770 align:start position:0%
that attorney-client Communications were
protected

07:44:18.770 --> 07:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
protected
 
07:44:22.010 --> 07:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
anything that was was confidential as a
 
07:44:24.490 --> 07:44:24.500 align:start position:0%
work product obviously
 
07:44:28.610 --> 07:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
a letter to the board of selectman
 
07:44:31.548 --> 07:44:31.558 align:start position:0%
to me from from the
 
07:44:34.310 --> 07:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
from the attorney
 
07:44:37.670 --> 07:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
in its final form I was thought was
 
07:44:40.368 --> 07:44:40.378 align:start position:0%
subject to the right to know once once
 
07:44:41.990 --> 07:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
that determination has been made and
 
07:44:45.048 --> 07:44:45.058 align:start position:0%
there's been a legal opinion given I
 
07:44:47.330 --> 07:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
don't recall that um
 
07:44:50.150 --> 07:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
those opinions were ever withheld and
 
07:44:51.770 --> 07:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
nor do I think they should be once
 
07:44:53.030 --> 07:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
they're in their final
 
07:44:57.170 --> 07:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:00.708 --> 07:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
may be wrong on that but that's
 
07:45:02.628 --> 07:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
just as a follow-up to that so the the
 
07:45:05.030 --> 07:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
only change
 
07:45:07.730 --> 07:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
is the recent court decision
 
07:45:10.850 --> 07:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
that's made this legislation what the
 
07:45:12.770 --> 07:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
legislation which was passed last year
 
07:45:15.650 --> 07:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
necessary is that your understanding
 
07:45:18.170 --> 07:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
that that's my understanding as I say I
 
07:45:20.030 --> 07:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
was ignorant of that until I came into
 
07:45:22.490 --> 07:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
this meeting I was puzzled as to why it
 
07:45:24.230 --> 07:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
was put in except
 
07:45:26.390 --> 07:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
that my thought was because there is
 
07:45:27.890 --> 07:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
always question about that and we're
 
07:45:29.930 --> 07:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
always going back and forth with our
 
07:45:32.030 --> 07:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys what is
 
07:45:34.490 --> 07:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
um privileged and what isn't my initial
 
07:45:37.270 --> 07:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
thought was this was a clarification
 
07:45:41.930 --> 07:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
and now I I find out it's a result of a
 
07:45:44.448 --> 07:45:44.458 align:start position:0%
a decision but I'm I don't know what
 
07:45:47.150 --> 07:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
that decision is
 
07:45:51.110 --> 07:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:52.968 --> 07:45:52.978 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr commissioner
 
07:45:55.190 --> 07:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:45:56.868 --> 07:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago I just got one more
 
07:46:17.990 --> 07:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:20.030 --> 07:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
honorable chair members of the Judiciary
 
07:46:22.430 --> 07:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
Committee it's an honor to be uh before
 
07:46:25.610 --> 07:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
you here today speaking on this bill
 
07:46:30.410 --> 07:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
hell's Bill 1073 which would repeal a
 
07:46:32.930 --> 07:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
bill that in a law that was passed last
 
07:46:35.810 --> 07:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
year by the general court
 
07:46:38.810 --> 07:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
this bill as you know would repeal the
 
07:46:40.910 --> 07:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
attorney client if passed would appeal
 
07:46:42.288 --> 07:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
the attorney client privilege and the
 
07:46:44.570 --> 07:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
work product Doctrine I've listened to
 
07:46:46.968 --> 07:46:46.978 align:start position:0%
the testimony here today and I'm here to
 
07:46:49.070 --> 07:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
let you know that uh
 
07:46:50.930 --> 07:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
again my name is Jim Kennedy I'm the
 
07:46:52.548 --> 07:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
City attorney across the street for the
 
07:46:55.250 --> 07:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
city of Concord I've been there for
 
07:46:58.430 --> 07:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
I guess 13 years or so now prior to that
 
07:47:00.530 --> 07:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
I was an Assistant Attorney General here
 
07:47:02.090 --> 07:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
in the Attorney General's office for a
 
07:47:04.368 --> 07:47:04.378 align:start position:0%
number of years and have provide and
 
07:47:06.230 --> 07:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
have been a government lawyer for the
 
07:47:08.270 --> 07:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
greater part of 20 years now
 
07:47:10.430 --> 07:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not going to repeat everything
 
07:47:12.288 --> 07:47:12.298 align:start position:0%
that was said here today but certainly
 
07:47:13.910 --> 07:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
the attorney client privilege and the
 
07:47:16.190 --> 07:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
work truck product Doctrine are
 
07:47:19.310 --> 07:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
essential in providing competent legal
 
07:47:22.128 --> 07:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
advice to governmental entities that
 
07:47:25.010 --> 07:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
require it on a day-to-day basis and it
 
07:47:28.070 --> 07:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
should be preserved at all times
 
07:47:29.990 --> 07:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
you should also know and I'll let you
 
07:47:31.548 --> 07:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
know this is that with respect to the
 
07:47:33.830 --> 07:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampstead decision I was one of the
 
07:47:36.708 --> 07:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
attorneys that read that decision that
 
07:47:39.048 --> 07:47:39.058 align:start position:0%
was not a party to the litigation at the
 
07:47:41.390 --> 07:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
time that it was originally filed but
 
07:47:43.670 --> 07:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
after reading the decision I was
 
07:47:45.350 --> 07:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
concerned by its outcome and how it
 
07:47:47.510 --> 07:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted because how I
 
07:47:49.070 --> 07:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
interpreted it is that it was
 
07:47:51.708 --> 07:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
eliminating and abolishing the
 
07:47:53.090 --> 07:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege in the work
 
07:47:55.788 --> 07:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
product Doctrine a sacred doctrine that
 
07:47:57.110 --> 07:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
has been around
 
07:47:59.570 --> 07:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
since Roman times we've always relied on
 
07:47:59.580 --> 07:48:00.770 align:start position:0%
since Roman times we've always relied on
it

07:48:00.770 --> 07:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:48:03.590 --> 07:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
and no the attorney-client privilege and
 
07:48:05.930 --> 07:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
the work product Doctrine there was no
 
07:48:09.288 --> 07:48:09.298 align:start position:0%
per se exception identified exemption
 
07:48:11.330 --> 07:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
and the right to know law there never
 
07:48:14.448 --> 07:48:14.458 align:start position:0%
was thought there to be a need for one I
 
07:48:16.730 --> 07:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
think commissioner Jasper is correct
 
07:48:19.310 --> 07:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's always been there it's a
 
07:48:22.010 --> 07:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
sacred Doctrine we've always relied on
 
07:48:23.628 --> 07:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
the attorney-client privilege of the
 
07:48:25.990 --> 07:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
work product Doctrine and not disclosing
 
07:48:29.448 --> 07:48:29.458 align:start position:0%
records under the right to no law but
 
07:48:31.310 --> 07:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
when that decision came down we became
 
07:48:31.320 --> 07:48:32.510 align:start position:0%
when that decision came down we became
concerned

07:48:32.510 --> 07:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
07:48:36.530 --> 07:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
and thought gosh is this sacred Doctrine
 
07:48:38.868 --> 07:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
now this privilege at risk
 
07:48:41.628 --> 07:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
and so we worked with our this
 
07:48:44.270 --> 07:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
legislature Representatives
 
07:48:47.208 --> 07:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
in responding to that decision because
 
07:48:48.708 --> 07:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
that's a New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
07:48:50.230 --> 07:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
decision that was effectively
 
07:48:52.730 --> 07:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
eliminating this privilege and Doctrine
 
07:48:56.388 --> 07:48:56.398 align:start position:0%
and so the general court signed this
 
07:48:59.150 --> 07:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
this bill House Bill 108 last year into
 
07:49:01.190 --> 07:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
law and it became the law of New
 
07:49:02.930 --> 07:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that the attorney client
 
07:49:05.330 --> 07:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
privilege and work product Doctrine are
 
07:49:07.250 --> 07:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
protected and exempt from disclosure
 
07:49:08.690 --> 07:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
under 91a
 
07:49:11.628 --> 07:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
now since that's happened you should
 
07:49:13.490 --> 07:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
know that I filed a motion to
 
07:49:15.288 --> 07:49:15.298 align:start position:0%
reconsideration in the Hampstead case
 
07:49:17.448 --> 07:49:17.458 align:start position:0%
myself along with a number of other
 
07:49:19.490 --> 07:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
Municipal attorneys as well as the
 
07:49:21.110 --> 07:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
07:49:23.448 --> 07:49:23.458 align:start position:0%
and requested that the court reconsider
 
07:49:25.670 --> 07:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
its decision in that case
 
07:49:28.190 --> 07:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
and since then the court has withdrawn
 
07:49:29.570 --> 07:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
its opinion
 
07:49:32.330 --> 07:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
so that case is no longer the law of the
 
07:49:32.340 --> 07:49:33.288 align:start position:0%
so that case is no longer the law of the
land

07:49:33.288 --> 07:49:33.298 align:start position:0%
land
 
07:49:35.448 --> 07:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
however what I'm concerned about here
 
07:49:38.090 --> 07:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
now is that we've gone to the
 
07:49:40.610 --> 07:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
legislature the legislature has passed
 
07:49:42.888 --> 07:49:42.898 align:start position:0%
House Bill 108 to make the
 
07:49:44.090 --> 07:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege and work
 
07:49:47.510 --> 07:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
product Doctrine exempt under 91a now
 
07:49:49.968 --> 07:49:49.978 align:start position:0%
and over at by this legislative body to
 
07:49:53.510 --> 07:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
remove that could send a signal
 
07:49:56.270 --> 07:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
that perhaps it's not protected perhaps
 
07:49:59.330 --> 07:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
it's not exempt but still of course
 
07:50:02.030 --> 07:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
being a government lawyer I would rely
 
07:50:04.850 --> 07:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
on that common law ancient law of
 
07:50:07.128 --> 07:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
privilege and Doctrine and would still
 
07:50:09.350 --> 07:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
argue that what I'm writing on my paper
 
07:50:11.930 --> 07:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
to the Concord city council the city
 
07:50:14.510 --> 07:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
manager the assessing director whoever
 
07:50:16.548 --> 07:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
I'm providing legal advice to on a daily
 
07:50:18.830 --> 07:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
basis is protected
 
07:50:23.090 --> 07:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
but this piece I think in 91a makes it
 
07:50:25.670 --> 07:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
very clear that it's protected and it's
 
07:50:28.128 --> 07:50:28.138 align:start position:0%
consistent with 91a if you look at 91a
 
07:50:29.270 --> 07:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
07:50:31.610 --> 07:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
look at the definition of meeting
 
07:50:34.910 --> 07:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
okay the representative who introduced
 
07:50:37.010 --> 07:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
this bill recognized it as such if you
 
07:50:39.170 --> 07:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
look at 9182
 
07:50:41.030 --> 07:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
where we Define meeting what a meeting
 
07:50:41.040 --> 07:50:42.048 align:start position:0%
where we Define meeting what a meeting
is

07:50:42.048 --> 07:50:42.058 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:50:43.610 --> 07:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
we go out and we lay out what a meeting
 
07:50:46.190 --> 07:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
is but a meeting is not consultation
 
07:50:48.230 --> 07:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
with legal counsel
 
07:50:50.208 --> 07:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
so anything in that meeting anything
 
07:50:52.250 --> 07:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
created it's not a meeting first of all
 
07:50:54.770 --> 07:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
but anything in that meeting is exempt
 
07:50:56.208 --> 07:50:56.218 align:start position:0%
from this is not even subject to
 
07:50:57.888 --> 07:50:57.898 align:start position:0%
disclosure any that meeting doesn't
 
07:50:59.750 --> 07:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
exist under the right to no law so
 
07:51:01.670 --> 07:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
anything discussed at that meeting is
 
07:51:04.070 --> 07:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
protected and that is rooted in the
 
07:51:06.288 --> 07:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege that's rooted
 
07:51:08.810 --> 07:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
in the work product Doctrine so having
 
07:51:12.110 --> 07:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
this exemption in 91 A5
 
07:51:14.510 --> 07:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense it's consistent with the
 
07:51:16.070 --> 07:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
purpose and intent of the right to know
 
07:51:16.080 --> 07:51:16.788 align:start position:0%
purpose and intent of the right to know
law

07:51:16.788 --> 07:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
law
 
07:51:20.750 --> 07:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
now I am absolutely uh in total
 
07:51:22.368 --> 07:51:22.378 align:start position:0%
agreement with the concept and the
 
07:51:24.110 --> 07:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of the right to know law and
 
07:51:25.990 --> 07:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
having sunshine and what government does
 
07:51:29.330 --> 07:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
and since my time in government
 
07:51:32.150 --> 07:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
at the state level the courts the AG's
 
07:51:34.670 --> 07:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
office and now with these city of
 
07:51:37.250 --> 07:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
Concord I have seen incredible changes
 
07:51:40.250 --> 07:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
in how more transparent government has
 
07:51:42.110 --> 07:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
been and has become over the past 20
 
07:51:44.990 --> 07:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
years it's remarkable well you know in
 
07:51:46.610 --> 07:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
large part it's because of what the
 
07:51:48.650 --> 07:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
internet has and what is out there
 
07:51:48.660 --> 07:51:50.090 align:start position:0%
internet has and what is out there
anyway

07:51:50.090 --> 07:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
07:51:52.368 --> 07:51:52.378 align:start position:0%
you know everything is online now all
 
07:51:53.810 --> 07:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
the meeting minutes everything the
 
07:51:55.968 --> 07:51:55.978 align:start position:0%
meetings that we have are live to
 
07:51:57.230 --> 07:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
everything is there
 
07:51:59.690 --> 07:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
so I think we are far more transparent
 
07:52:02.810 --> 07:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
today than we were five years ago 10
 
07:52:04.850 --> 07:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
years ago and certainly when I started
 
07:52:07.910 --> 07:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
my practice more than 20 years ago
 
07:52:10.610 --> 07:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
so the point is is Hampstead was out
 
07:52:12.770 --> 07:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
there Hampstead was certainly what
 
07:52:15.288 --> 07:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
triggered the the great need for this
 
07:52:17.570 --> 07:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
because government lawyers became very
 
07:52:17.580 --> 07:52:18.708 align:start position:0%
because government lawyers became very
concerned

07:52:18.708 --> 07:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
07:52:20.868 --> 07:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
you know general counsel for the Supreme
 
07:52:22.968 --> 07:52:22.978 align:start position:0%
Court general counsel for the Senate
 
07:52:25.910 --> 07:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
general counsel for this body the New
 
07:52:26.990 --> 07:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire House Representatives
 
07:52:29.990 --> 07:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
certainly when I was in ag I recall I
 
07:52:32.150 --> 07:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
represented certain members of this body
 
07:52:34.850 --> 07:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
in litigation individual members that
 
07:52:36.048 --> 07:52:36.058 align:start position:0%
were sued
 
07:52:38.030 --> 07:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
as an Assistant Attorney General and
 
07:52:39.288 --> 07:52:39.298 align:start position:0%
established the attorney-client
 
07:52:40.910 --> 07:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
privilege with each of those members
 
07:52:43.010 --> 07:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
that I represented
 
07:52:44.868 --> 07:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
I represented the Secretary of State's
 
07:52:47.810 --> 07:52:47.820 align:start position:0%
office in litigation I represented a
 
07:52:50.750 --> 07:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
number of entities throughout government
 
07:52:53.150 --> 07:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
and to eliminate the privilege not that
 
07:52:55.070 --> 07:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
this repealing this act would do that
 
07:52:59.270 --> 07:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
but repealing it creates a very uneven
 
07:53:02.510 --> 07:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
playing field it puts those that are
 
07:53:04.730 --> 07:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
suing government at an extreme Advantage
 
07:53:07.670 --> 07:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
if God forbid it was determined somehow
 
07:53:10.010 --> 07:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
that the attorney client privilege and
 
07:53:12.708 --> 07:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
warp product Doctrine was abolished
 
07:53:14.448 --> 07:53:14.458 align:start position:0%
for government lawyers
 
07:53:16.670 --> 07:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
gosh I go out into private practice the
 
07:53:18.468 --> 07:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
first thing I'm going to do when I sue a
 
07:53:20.750 --> 07:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
governmental entities demand to see the
 
07:53:22.430 --> 07:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
work product file of the attorney
 
07:53:25.070 --> 07:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
representing that governmental entity
 
07:53:28.010 --> 07:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
let's preserve this Doctrine and
 
07:53:29.510 --> 07:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
remember some of the things that we
 
07:53:32.150 --> 07:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
learned today about it is narrow it
 
07:53:34.010 --> 07:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
certainly is a narrow Doctrine the
 
07:53:36.410 --> 07:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
privilege is narrow the control group is
 
07:53:39.708 --> 07:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
what we practice here in New Hampshire
 
07:53:41.150 --> 07:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
and certainly
 
07:53:41.160 --> 07:53:45.350 align:start position:0%
and certainly
um

07:53:45.350 --> 07:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:47.628 --> 07:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
in any event let me just say that it is
 
07:53:50.930 --> 07:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
a doctrine that is rooted In fairness
 
07:53:53.330 --> 07:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's rooted in keeping the playing field
 
07:53:55.910 --> 07:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
level and it's something that we in New
 
07:53:59.750 --> 07:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should maintain in as a as a
 
07:54:01.310 --> 07:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
government lawyer and representing
 
07:54:03.230 --> 07:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
governmental entity it's something that
 
07:54:05.330 --> 07:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
I rely on every day
 
07:54:10.490 --> 07:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:13.610 --> 07:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia
 
07:54:15.048 --> 07:54:15.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
07:54:17.990 --> 07:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:20.810 --> 07:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
it's not a well-formed question
 
07:54:25.368 --> 07:54:25.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:28.548 --> 07:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
leaving this in place and having such
 
07:54:32.510 --> 07:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:35.448 --> 07:54:35.458 align:start position:0%
the attorney-client privilege with a a
 
07:54:38.930 --> 07:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:41.990 --> 07:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
seems to be at least slightly in
 
07:54:45.288 --> 07:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
conflict with transparency and in the
 
07:54:46.430 --> 07:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
case of
 
07:54:50.270 --> 07:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps the worst actors that is going
 
07:54:54.230 --> 07:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
to be a very possible Refuge
 
07:54:57.830 --> 07:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
to do bad things
 
07:55:00.410 --> 07:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
are you concerned that that
 
07:55:05.448 --> 07:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:07.788 --> 07:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
I think that the potential to do bad
 
07:55:10.968 --> 07:55:10.978 align:start position:0%
things always exists under the right to
 
07:55:12.590 --> 07:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
no law in general
 
07:55:15.288 --> 07:55:15.298 align:start position:0%
so because the right to no law dictates
 
07:55:17.570 --> 07:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
that a quorum is necessary to conduct a
 
07:55:19.430 --> 07:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
meeting and that the like right to no
 
07:55:21.910 --> 07:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
law doesn't require there doesn't
 
07:55:24.708 --> 07:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
encourage communication among members of
 
07:55:26.090 --> 07:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
a public body
 
07:55:27.888 --> 07:55:27.898 align:start position:0%
those are out there and those are
 
07:55:30.410 --> 07:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
protections that we have but could
 
07:55:33.948 --> 07:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
you know potential uh uh misgivings
 
07:55:36.530 --> 07:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
happen from time to time certainly uh
 
07:55:39.110 --> 07:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper said that they do
 
07:55:40.730 --> 07:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
but the attorney-client privilege is
 
07:55:42.650 --> 07:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
something that has been around
 
07:55:44.150 --> 07:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
for centuries
 
07:55:45.770 --> 07:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
the doctrine has been around for
 
07:55:45.780 --> 07:55:46.968 align:start position:0%
the doctrine has been around for
centuries

07:55:46.968 --> 07:55:46.978 align:start position:0%
centuries
 
07:55:48.708 --> 07:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that there are Bad
 
07:55:51.048 --> 07:55:51.058 align:start position:0%
actors out there
 
07:55:53.930 --> 07:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
I think that the good outweighs the bad
 
07:55:55.850 --> 07:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
07:55:55.860 --> 07:55:56.690 align:start position:0%
I think that
um

07:55:56.690 --> 07:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:56:00.110 --> 07:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
creating that unlevel playing field
 
07:56:03.230 --> 07:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
having a client and not providing that
 
07:56:04.490 --> 07:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
client the protection of the
 
07:56:05.990 --> 07:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege of the work
 
07:56:07.610 --> 07:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
product Doctrine
 
07:56:10.368 --> 07:56:10.378 align:start position:0%
is a disservice to that client is
 
07:56:13.490 --> 07:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
creating a disservice to government
 
07:56:14.990 --> 07:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
07:56:18.410 --> 07:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
you know is it against transparency well
 
07:56:20.030 --> 07:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
I guess that's the basis of the attorney
 
07:56:22.670 --> 07:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
client privilege if you hire a lawyer
 
07:56:26.090 --> 07:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
you're seeking counsel from that lawyer
 
07:56:28.788 --> 07:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
in confidence and that lawyer under the
 
07:56:31.250 --> 07:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
rules of professional conduct both in
 
07:56:33.048 --> 07:56:33.058 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and every state in the
 
07:56:35.150 --> 07:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
nation requires that that communication
 
07:56:36.830 --> 07:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
be held in confidence
 
07:56:40.730 --> 07:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
unless you as the client wave that
 
07:56:40.740 --> 07:56:42.110 align:start position:0%
unless you as the client wave that
privilege

07:56:42.110 --> 07:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
privilege
 
07:56:44.570 --> 07:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's appropriate to waive
 
07:56:46.430 --> 07:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
that privilege right I mean sometimes
 
07:56:48.110 --> 07:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
there could be something where the
 
07:56:50.208 --> 07:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
governmental body says let's waive that
 
07:56:52.490 --> 07:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
privilege and if you listen to me on the
 
07:56:54.288 --> 07:56:54.298 align:start position:0%
first Monday of every night you'll see
 
07:56:55.910 --> 07:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
that from time to time I'm providing
 
07:56:58.010 --> 07:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
legal counsel publicly
 
07:56:59.868 --> 07:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
and the council is asking those
 
07:57:01.788 --> 07:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
questions publicly knowing that they're
 
07:57:04.670 --> 07:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
waiving the privilege
 
07:57:07.070 --> 07:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
and so sometimes that does occur and
 
07:57:08.690 --> 07:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes there could be opinions out
 
07:57:11.150 --> 07:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
there that are waived
 
07:57:13.070 --> 07:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
but oftentimes there could be Decisions
 
07:57:15.530 --> 07:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
by the governmental body where the
 
07:57:17.208 --> 07:57:17.218 align:start position:0%
decision the public decision is
 
07:57:18.708 --> 07:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
reflected in the council that they were
 
07:57:18.718 --> 07:57:22.070 align:start position:0%
reflected in the council that they were
provided

07:57:22.070 --> 07:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:25.070 --> 07:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
I apologize representative page please I
 
07:57:26.510 --> 07:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
apologize for the late hour to my
 
07:57:28.368 --> 07:57:28.378 align:start position:0%
colleagues but if I'm a feeling like I'm
 
07:57:32.030 --> 07:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
an aggrieved citizen where my board may
 
07:57:34.010 --> 07:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
be used aboard in the town or city
 
07:57:35.990 --> 07:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
wherever is
 
07:57:38.690 --> 07:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
um abusing the work
 
07:57:40.610 --> 07:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
attorney-client work product Doctrine
 
07:57:42.650 --> 07:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
maybe just labeling things or I've read
 
07:57:44.810 --> 07:57:44.820 align:start position:0%
things where people will of course abuse
 
07:57:47.448 --> 07:57:47.458 align:start position:0%
that privilege and it's not really work
 
07:57:49.250 --> 07:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
product or maybe it is and it's just
 
07:57:50.868 --> 07:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
kind of becoming abusive what's my
 
07:57:50.878 --> 07:57:52.490 align:start position:0%
kind of becoming abusive what's my
remedy

07:57:52.490 --> 07:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
remedy
 
07:57:56.330 --> 07:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
if I'm a citizen from Exeter where I am
 
07:57:59.090 --> 07:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
if I feel like my town board is is
 
07:58:02.030 --> 07:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
abusing or refuse excessively using the
 
07:58:03.888 --> 07:58:03.898 align:start position:0%
right to know so I want to be careful
 
07:58:06.530 --> 07:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
not to provide legal advice as to
 
07:58:08.690 --> 07:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
provide counsel to you here
 
07:58:12.830 --> 07:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
as to how to how to uh file a lawsuit or
 
07:58:15.770 --> 07:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
as like if I could just add but many as
 
07:58:19.310 --> 07:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
a citizen but any document generally
 
07:58:21.888 --> 07:58:21.898 align:start position:0%
had you know has to be labeled as such
 
07:58:24.170 --> 07:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
and identified under the applicable
 
07:58:24.180 --> 07:58:25.250 align:start position:0%
and identified under the applicable
exemption

07:58:25.250 --> 07:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
07:58:28.070 --> 07:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
and when lawsuits are filed under the
 
07:58:30.350 --> 07:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
right to know law oftentimes there's a
 
07:58:32.448 --> 07:58:32.458 align:start position:0%
Von index created
 
07:58:34.850 --> 07:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
and it may identify well this document
 
07:58:37.310 --> 07:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
is not subject to disclosure because
 
07:58:39.650 --> 07:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
it's privacy or this document's not
 
07:58:41.388 --> 07:58:41.398 align:start position:0%
subject disclosure because it's
 
07:58:43.730 --> 07:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege and it may be
 
07:58:45.830 --> 07:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
that the court would have to determine
 
07:58:48.948 --> 07:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
what those documents are perhaps what's
 
07:58:50.810 --> 07:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
called in-camera
 
07:58:53.750 --> 07:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
behind the closed door of the court to
 
07:58:55.910 --> 07:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
to assess what those documents are and
 
07:58:58.430 --> 07:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
so there could be potentially a
 
07:59:00.110 --> 07:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
challenge well you're saying those are
 
07:59:02.270 --> 07:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege documents
 
07:59:04.368 --> 07:59:04.378 align:start position:0%
let's look at those and there have been
 
07:59:06.410 --> 07:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
courts that have actually done that have
 
07:59:09.110 --> 07:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
looked at the the the exemption and the
 
07:59:10.670 --> 07:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
scope of the attorney client privilege
 
07:59:13.490 --> 07:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
for instance billing records were once
 
07:59:15.128 --> 07:59:15.138 align:start position:0%
challenged and there's a certain
 
07:59:17.570 --> 07:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
threshold of what billing records of the
 
07:59:20.208 --> 07:59:20.218 align:start position:0%
attorney to the governmental entity have
 
07:59:23.810 --> 07:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
to be disclosed and so
 
07:59:26.270 --> 07:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
you could certainly uh make the inquiry
 
07:59:28.128 --> 07:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
of the body you know what it what is it
 
07:59:32.570 --> 07:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
that um is being uh withheld and why
 
07:59:35.270 --> 07:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh the bot the bodies required to
 
07:59:38.150 --> 07:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
identify the exemption as to what is
 
07:59:40.190 --> 07:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
being withheld
 
07:59:41.930 --> 07:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
um but certainly at the end of the day
 
07:59:43.730 --> 07:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
if there's litigation a court would be
 
07:59:46.010 --> 07:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
the ultimate determinant determination
 
07:59:47.570 --> 07:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
as to what whether or not that specific
 
07:59:51.650 --> 07:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:55.190 --> 07:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else any other questions
 
07:59:59.208 --> 07:59:59.218 align:start position:0%
yes representative dilorenzo
 
08:00:00.708 --> 08:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you if you take
 
08:00:00.718 --> 08:00:01.730 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you if you take
questions

08:00:01.730 --> 08:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
questions
 
08:00:01.740 --> 08:00:02.570 align:start position:0%
questions
um

08:00:02.570 --> 08:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:00:05.750 --> 08:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
attorney Kennedy could you just
 
08:00:09.170 --> 08:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
go back over what happened with the
 
08:00:11.030 --> 08:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
court case
 
08:00:14.448 --> 08:00:14.458 align:start position:0%
involved with SAU 55 you said that
 
08:00:15.948 --> 08:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
you've filed a motion for
 
08:00:19.010 --> 08:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
reconsideration and the decision was
 
08:00:21.410 --> 08:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
withdrawn that's correct okay I mean
 
08:00:22.670 --> 08:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of that before how does
 
08:00:25.128 --> 08:00:25.138 align:start position:0%
that work so it's no longer president
 
08:00:25.138 --> 08:00:25.788 align:start position:0%
that work so it's no longer president
um

08:00:25.788 --> 08:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:00:29.150 --> 08:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
it was a it it it I guess it's not
 
08:00:31.128 --> 08:00:31.138 align:start position:0%
unprecedented but
 
08:00:35.510 --> 08:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
um uh the municipal bar as well as the
 
08:00:37.128 --> 08:00:37.138 align:start position:0%
um Attorney General's office had
 
08:00:39.110 --> 08:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed the decision and made a
 
08:00:40.670 --> 08:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
decision that we would file what's
 
08:00:43.368 --> 08:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
called an amicus brief or an amicus
 
08:00:45.170 --> 08:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
memorandum of Law and file a motion for
 
08:00:45.180 --> 08:00:46.910 align:start position:0%
memorandum of Law and file a motion for
reconsideration

08:00:46.910 --> 08:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
08:00:49.388 --> 08:00:49.398 align:start position:0%
um in the court thereafter reviewed it
 
08:00:52.430 --> 08:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
there was never ultimately a decision on
 
08:00:55.610 --> 08:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
it but the parties because they had uh
 
08:00:55.620 --> 08:00:57.368 align:start position:0%
it but the parties because they had uh
uh

08:00:57.368 --> 08:00:57.378 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:01:00.170 --> 08:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
resolved the matter I believe amically
 
08:01:02.208 --> 08:01:02.218 align:start position:0%
outside a Judicial decision it was
 
08:01:04.310 --> 08:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately withdrawn the decision was
 
08:01:04.320 --> 08:01:08.150 align:start position:0%
ultimately withdrawn the decision was
