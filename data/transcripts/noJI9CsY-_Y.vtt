on the uh
 
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
credit limit that we were discussing
 
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 align:start position:0%

Finance Authority uh thank you for
 
00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
having me here today I understand there
 
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
was some brief discussion last week
 
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
about the section in hb2 to increase the
 
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
bfa's contingent credit limit from its
 
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
current limit of 115 million to 200
 
00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
million so I wanted to make myself
 
00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
available today both to talk a little
 
00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
bit about what the BFA what we do what
 
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
we don't a little bit about the request
 
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
and why it's important for us and then
 
00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
of course you know trying to answer any
 
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
um

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
so if I could I'd love to just explain
 
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
briefly who the BFA is
 
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
um and why this is important to us
 
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
um so the New Hampshire BFA is has been
 
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
around for a little over 30 years we
 
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
were created
 
00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
um on the tales of a banking crisis
 
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
um when Banks were going out of business
 
00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
were left and right in the state during
 
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
the Savings and Loan crisis late 80s
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
early 90s uh Governor Judd Greg created
 
00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
the BFA with the assistance of the
 
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 align:start position:0%
legislature at the time and our mission
 
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
really is to help ensure that companies
 
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who want to attract
 
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
financing and can afford to repay that
 
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
financing are able to get that financing
 
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
from their bank so they can grow and
 
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
they can make jobs
 
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.770 align:start position:0%
they can make jobs
couple

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 align:start position:0%
couple
 
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
interesting facts about the BFA
 
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
um is it has always designed to operate
 
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
as a fully self-funding state agency and
 
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
never use any state taxpayer dollars and
 
00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 align:start position:0%
that's been true the state has
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
occasionally used us as a conduit to
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
give grants to groups they want to give
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
and how to oversee those grants but
 
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 align:start position:0%
we've never
 
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
use State taxpayer dollars for our
 
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
lending our operations our activities
 
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
everything we do has to pay for itself
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
um we provide a couple of different
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
Services the thing we're known for the
 
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
most is our loan guarantee program it's
 
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
used when a company needs a little bit
 
00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 align:start position:0%
of help getting across the Finish Line
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
with their lender a very recent example
 
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
of that program is a company known as
 
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
Sperry tents Exeter rentals or the legal
 
00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
name they make and they do tents they
 
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
rent tents for outdoor events right
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
um there was a little something a couple
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
years ago you know called covid-19 and
 
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
you might remember people weren't
 
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
allowed to get together for a brief
 
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
um at all and then with certain numbers
 
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
and then Etc et cetera and you've got to
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
imagine if you're an event tent rental
 
00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
company this sort of it crushed you
 
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
right so that was very difficult for
 
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
that business in particular
 
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
restrictions were lifted later date
 
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
again to recover began to do well needed
 
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
some financing from their bank and their
 
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
Bank said as required by Federal
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
Regulation show me your last three years
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
financial statements
 
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
they didn't look so great they had all
 
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
the reasons in the world why they didn't
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
look so great but nonetheless the bank
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
was simply not allowed to make them
 
00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 align:start position:0%
alone without some type of credit
 
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
enhancement from somebody like the BFA
 
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
so we sat we analyzed the company good
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
company been around a long time went
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
through a clear
 
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
situation that really wasn't there
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
within their control and now needed help
 
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
to get across we helped provide a loan
 
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
guarantee for a loan for the company
 
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
they're doing great and everything's
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
going fine
 
00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 align:start position:0%
um you know they employ a lot a lot of
 
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
people here in New Hampshire so that's
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
sort of an example of some of what our
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
loan guarantee programs reviews you know
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
been used for
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
other situations we're known for we help
 
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 align:start position:0%
bring BAE Systems to Manchester
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
they have employed over 800 people now
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
in Manchester which is a Big Boon for
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
the city and really for the state and
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
recently we've done two transactions
 
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
with Sig Sauer that have caused them to
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
help have a facility to produce the new
 
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
next-gen machine gun that supports our
 
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
armed services so we work with big
 
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 align:start position:0%
employers we work with small employers
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
um and our products have been used we've
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
never had the state ever had to cover
 
00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
one of our guarantees we we require
 
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
collateral in every single transaction
 
00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
and we're required to establish reserves
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
to cover any loss to insulate the state
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
from paying on a guarantee if it were
 
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
ever to be required
 
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 align:start position:0%
um we've been very busy in the last
 
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
several years it's been eight years
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
since our limit has been increased it's
 
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
happened several times throughout the
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
history since the 90s
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
inflation has been very serious
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
um especially in the constructing of new
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
building I don't know if you've tried to
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
get a piece of plywood to replace your
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
garage recently but it's pretty wild or
 
00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
you know heck you know I think you know
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
steel beam
 
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
um but long story short you know a 10
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
million dollar building not that long
 
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
ago is a 20 million dollar building now
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
so it takes us more of our contingent
 
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 align:start position:0%
credit limit to do the same transactions
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
and at the same time we're also seeing
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
more requests than we've ever seen so
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
this is important to us we're actually
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
getting close to being out of our
 
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
contingent credit limit so the request
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
is Timely
 
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take questions
 
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
all right for those trying to follow
 
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
this it's on page 89 in House Bill 2
 
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
Section 281 representative McGuire has a
 
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
for coming so
 
00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
um let's use the temp company as an
 
00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:20.870 align:start position:0%
um let's use the temp company as an
example

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
let's say they fail right and and go
 
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
bankrupt what would happen you would get
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
position possession of the tents and
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
sell them and to pay yourself back or
 
00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
how does that work almost yes uh thank
 
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
you representative it would the bank
 
00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
actually would do that so you know we're
 
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
really working with the bank so the bank
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
can provide a loan to that company so
 
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
the bank's obligation is to First
 
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
liquidate any collateral that's
 
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.930 align:start position:0%
liquidate any collateral that's
available

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
um pursue all the personal guarantors of
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
the business which are required and then
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
we would look at what any deficiency
 
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
that remains if any at that point after
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
paying off as much of the loan as they
 
00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
can from the collateral which typically
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
covers all of it but if there were a
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
loss the BFA guarantee would pay a
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
portion of that remaining loss with the
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
bank bearing the difference and we would
 
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
use our reserves that we set up when we
 
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
originally backed the loan
 
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:23.300 align:start position:0%
to cover that difference
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
so do you get some kind of fee from the
 
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
tent company that builds up your
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
reserves yeah that's right um we
 
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
actually charge the banks a fee for our
 
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.230 align:start position:0%
actually charge the banks a fee for our
services

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
um and those fees build up a reserve
 
00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:41.459 align:start position:0%
um the banks typically charge the
 
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
customer that fee it's a service to that
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
customer it's a service to that bank
 
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:50.180 align:start position:0%
they're expected to pay for the usage
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
and they pay fee and that has
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
capitalized our reserves for for 30
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
years and they keep paying the fee every
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
year the guarantee is in place and so
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
the minute they don't need it anymore
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
we get the call to say you know hey we
 
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
don't want to keep paying this fee which
 
00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
we think is great because now the
 
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
liability is erased and the market has
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
done its thing
 
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
so so so the worst that could happen
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
would be there's sort of a major
 
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
recession lots of people
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
are out and and the value of their good
 
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
there's collateral is not very good and
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
therefore the state would have to come
 
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
up with whatever this number is is that
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
right yeah in a in a very
 
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
apocalyptic scenario if they all went
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
out of business at the same time and the
 
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
values weren't collateral value wasn't
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
worth it and the BFA couldn't make up
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
the difference then the state would be
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
asked to pay and that's
 
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
thankfully never happened we don't
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate that ever will
 
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.269 align:start position:0%
anticipate that ever will
um

00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
you know they do look at the likelihood
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
of that scenario when they look at our
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
debt affordability studying our bond
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
rating is to say is this you know what's
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
really going to happen here I spoke to
 
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
the treasurer on Friday she said she has
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
no concerns with this increase
 
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to confirm that with her
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
directly of course I have one more
 
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:14.060 align:start position:0%
one more okay thank you
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
so right now you're getting close to
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
your 115 million total is that right so
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
so when you're let's say you had
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
let's say you had 5 million left right
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
and and three five million projects came
 
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
in you would look for whichever one
 
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
seemed to be the best
 
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
the least risky presumably and fund that
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
one and say sorry to the other two or
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
something like that is that right yeah
 
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
we would operate on a first come first
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
serve basis so anyone who was eligible
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
was the would get the services first as
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
long as they were deemed to be of you
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
know low enough risk and a sufficient
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
public benefit to be eligible period we
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
don't you know pick it's
 
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
if you're eligible you get in line and
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
we take a look and go from there
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
oh so you don't sort of think the tent
 
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
company is is better than the balloon
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
company or something else that no uh I
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
mean I might have opinions on this
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
balloon company I don't know but
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
um you know we don't it doesn't it
 
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't work that way I assume yeah
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
for other questions from members of the
 
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.690 align:start position:0%
for other questions from members of the
division

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:31.700 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire does have an
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
amendment that he has passed out or you
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
like to discuss that sure so the very
 
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
copy of it sir I I would love a copy
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
okay oh it's got it it changes the
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
number so it changes the number from 200
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
million to 150 million and the the
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
reason for this change is I looked at
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
the hit the history of this number is
 
00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
actually in the law so you don't have to
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
look too far to see it but it started at
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
50 million and it went to 80
 
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
um in 1993 and then it went to 95 in
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
1994 and then
 
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.130 align:start position:0%
1994 and then
um

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
looks like 21 years later it went to 115
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
right so for a very long time they
 
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:23.339 align:start position:0%
didn't need any extra and then now
 
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
they're asking for 200 all right but
 
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
it's that's that's a much bigger
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
increase than it has ever been in the
 
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
past right that's that's uh I don't know
 
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:36.949 align:start position:0%
what it is
um

00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
close to 100 percent right that's 80 or
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
something increase right and only eight
 
00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:47.459 align:start position:0%
years later when the last increase took
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
21 years to happen so so the 150 million
 
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.490 align:start position:0%
21 years to happen so so the 150 million
is

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.470 align:start position:0%
is
what

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.449 align:start position:0%
what
um

00:12:55.449 --> 00:12:55.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
115 million was in 2015 in today's
 
00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
dollars so if you apply inflation to 115
 
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
million from 2015 you get 150 you
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
actually get 148 but that's what it is
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
so it kind of gives them back the same
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
Authority they had the last time this
 
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
was raised that's my my concept would
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
you like to comment Mr Wallace
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
um we'd be very appreciative of an
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
increase of 150 million you know a 200
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
million increase would prevent us from
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
coming back here again
 
00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
um you know representative McGuire is
 
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
correct inflation gets you right at that
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
figure we're I think also facing the
 
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
fact that we're just busier than we
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
historically have been
 
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.490 align:start position:0%
historically have been
um

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know an increase to 150 million I'd
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
still be a happy person with a
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
functioning state agency and uh
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know more is always better for us
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
but I'll just leave it at that
 
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
let's move by representative McGuire's
 
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
it's seconded
 
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney
 
00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative evil
 
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.150 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative evil
um

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
I guess I in in my experience with the
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
state treasurer I've found her to be
 
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
extremely conservative in her views and
 
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
in her estimates as we would want a
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
Treasurer to be and we haven't confirmed
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
this with her directly but you said
 
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
you've talked to her about the credit
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
limit and she expressed no concerns
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative that's that's
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
correct um I'd also note that the
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
treasurer is on our board of directors
 
00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
and is a voting member on every
 
00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:44.750 align:start position:0%
and is a voting member on every
transaction

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yeah having having
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh it's not it's not a question but it's
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
a comment having used this um this you
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
know their their services in the city of
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
Rochester to attract businesses there in
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
both the Sig situation and um and the
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
saffron situation previously and I was
 
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
intimately involved with the saffron
 
00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
situation you know as Things become more
 
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
competitive out there in fact cut group
 
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
Cutthroat when it comes to attracting
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
businesses to a state
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
the business Finance Authority has been
 
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
in a tremendous service to the
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
communities who have been trying to
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
attract businesses to the state of New
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and jobs the state of New
 
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.870 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and jobs the state of New
Hampshire

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
um you know I have no problem with 150
 
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
000 I'm sure they would they would love
 
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
the 150 million 150 million dollar limit
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
but the thing is is that are they going
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
to be back here in four years saying you
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
know we need it again and is there a
 
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
possibility that this could hamstring a
 
00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
community who has a major corporation
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
wants to come to New Hampshire
 
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.189 align:start position:0%
wants to come to New Hampshire
um the

00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
regardless even no matter if they're a
 
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
Fortune 500 company or not a lot of
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
times Banks look at it and say any type
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
of expansion is risky they're going to
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
be looking for guarantees and these
 
00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
these people here help the local
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
communities get these businesses this is
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
not impacting the taxpayers one bit this
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
is only the bond rating and these people
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous record I would be
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
opposed to this because I think we need
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
to give our communities here in the
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as much as many
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
tools as we can to compete with other
 
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
states because other states are doing
 
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
this and a lot more I'll tell you when
 
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
we were dealing with saffron I think I
 
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned this we were dealing with
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
North Carolina and they were it was very
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
aggressive and it went right down to the
 
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
last minute and one of the things that
 
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
we got was the business Finance
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
Authority to come in guaranteeing their
 
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
loans and when they did that that closed
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
the deal for the City of Rochester to
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
bring a major Aviation company to the
 
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
so let me ask
 
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
um do you have a maximum that you will
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
ever give any one project and and how
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
much would this extra 35 million how
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
many years would you project that would
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
last for you
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative there are
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
maximums in some programs and no
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
maximums in other programs
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
so one of our programs actually our most
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
frequently used program is known as cap
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
the way cap works is when a bank wants
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
to make a loan to a small business that
 
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:20.579 align:start position:0%
normally wouldn't otherwise be able to
 
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
access Credit they can enroll it in cap
 
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
the bank pays a fee into an account
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
the borrower pays a fee into an account
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
and we put some money into an account
 
00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
that account grows each time a new cap
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
deal is enrolled and it's used as a
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
pooled loan loss reserve for that bank
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
for that bank's caps customers there's a
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
loss they can recover from the account
 
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
to the Limit that's in the account those
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
loans are limited to five hundred
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars right that's been used
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
by over I think over 5 000 companies now
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
in the states very active right
 
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.909 align:start position:0%
in the states very active right
um

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
when we guarantee a line of credit for A
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
bank's loan to a company that has a
 
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
limit of two million dollars per
 
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.710 align:start position:0%
limit of two million dollars per
transaction

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
term loans for real estate and Equipment
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
have no statutory limit so it's a little
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to predict
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
um but I'll give you an example so the
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
six hour transaction the BFA approved
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
just a few weeks ago to really expand
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
that company they have a very new
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
exciting situation it's going to employ
 
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
a ton of people is a 33 million dollar
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
transaction right so if it's a line of
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
credit I would say this might last us
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
quite a while you know it could be a few
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
years before we're back if another big
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
opportunity comes it could use this
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
entire increase in one Transit and one
 
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
foul swoop and we'd be back here
 
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
you know as soon as I could convince
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
someone to schedule me and so
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
so it's a little hard to guess if you
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
had to pin me down representative I'd
 
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.250 align:start position:0%
had to pin me down representative I'd
say

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.150 align:start position:0%
say
um

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just two comments um
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
I believe that it's more than reasonable
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
to go to the 200 million because if you
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
look at it it's it's 2.5 x what it was
 
00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
in 1993 and things have gone way up more
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
than 2.5 x since then and the other
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is I believe that this
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
is an important uh function that keeps
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire advantage in getting
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
businesses here uh so I I personally
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
would would grant them the 200 million
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
from one Vernon
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
also uh more or less just a comment
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
I feel uh
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
I feel pretty good about leaving it at
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
the 200 particularly as the say
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
treasurers we all know was very
 
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.650 align:start position:0%
treasurers we all know was very
conservative

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
conservative
 
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
system aboard
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
and will have a voice in overlooking
 
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
things so I too am I I don't really see
 
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
the need to lower lower the limit
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
thanks representative griffiniti any
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.890 align:start position:0%
other comments
see

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
ing none are I'll I'll just comment I
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
did ask a question but I agree with um
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
representative cambrells and and Griffin
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
and uh grassy that they seem extremely
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
solid they seem extremely well managed
 
00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:28.220 align:start position:0%
they seem conservative and I think that
 
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
our state is in competition with our
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
area States and that this would really
 
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
continue to bolster our competitive
 
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
advantages in the state which we're very
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
interested in bolstering so I'll be
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
voting um
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
respectfully against the motion and
 
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
would support leaving the cap as it is
 
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:53.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions with the
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%

McGuire amendment that was handed out on
Friday

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%

does everybody have a copy of the
 
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.470 align:start position:0%
does everybody have a copy of the
amendment

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:23:14.409 --> 00:23:14.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
all right representative McGuire would
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
like to speak to his
 
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.970 align:start position:0%
like to speak to his
Amendment

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
this is something that used to be in the
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
budget until 12 years ago representative
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
Allen Court
 
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:35.990 align:start position:0%
Allen Court
um

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh talked us into getting rid of it I
 
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
guess it didn't take any talking into in
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
my mind but
 
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
um so it hasn't been in the budget for
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
for 12 years
 
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.470 align:start position:0%
for 12 years
um

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
and in my mind this is inappropriate use
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
of public funds
 
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.909 align:start position:0%
of public funds
um

00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
the way we get money from taxpayers is
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
by force we we take a certain amount of
 
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.330 align:start position:0%
by force we we take a certain amount of
money

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
and in a lot of ways we you know we use
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
it for very legitimate purposes in many
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
ways right courts prisons Etc we also
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
use it for uh effectively charitable
 
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
things elderly disabled education and so
 
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.850 align:start position:0%
things elderly disabled education and so
on

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
but here we're using it for creation of
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
of television
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
something that the the public is
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
perfectly capable of funding on their
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
own uh they don't they don't need our
 
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.909 align:start position:0%
own uh they don't they don't need our
help

00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
um the the amount of video and
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
television and programming and so on has
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
exploded and I think that other areas of
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
the budget are much more deserving than
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
this one we've been talking this morning
 
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
to division three and they're struggling
 
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
with rates for Medicaid and so on right
 
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.250 align:start position:0%
with rates for Medicaid and so on right
so

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
um so I just don't think this
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
expenditure is Justified it's as simple
 
00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:12.299 align:start position:0%
as that
 
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner Stewart
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
um so I am here today representing my
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
agency and this is funding that would go
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:27.419 align:start position:0%
um Council on the Arts account and then
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
the council on the Arts would pass the
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
funding over to public television so I
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that that that's
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
clear to everybody
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
um a couple of points that I'd like to
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
make number one is historically the New
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Council on the Arts has
 
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.850 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Council on the Arts has
to

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
um be very creative in finding a match
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
for their federal funds and I think we
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
discussed this a little bit the last not
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
last time at the time before that I was
 
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.310 align:start position:0%
last time at the time before that I was
here

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
um because the um the the national Arts
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
organization issues an amount of money
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
for each state and each state then has
 
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
to come up with a dollar for dollar
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
match for that fund and that often has
 
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
been a struggle for for the Arts to do
 
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
so they count they count my time towards
 
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
that and some other
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
um increment moose plate dollars for
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
example because they process a lot of
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
moose plate dollars to make the to make
 
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
the match work so just for a dollar for
 
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.070 align:start position:0%
the match work so just for a dollar for
dollar

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
exercise having some flexibility with
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
finding a match for the federal
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
allocation would be very nice for the
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
Arts to have
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
um we won't know what our budget is
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
until the end of this budget season for
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
the Arts so we don't know what we'll
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
need to come up with the match it's the
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
governor was very generous I think to
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
the Arts budget in his version of the
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
budget but as you know we won't know
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
until hopefully June uh what the what
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
the budget will be and then we'll have
 
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to match that for to
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
to achieve our federal allocation so
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
that's one piece of it
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
um the other piece I would say is that
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
uh the programming that is um
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
plant in in talks with public television
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
it was very important for me to
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
understand that there could be some uh
 
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
Synergy between the work that the
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
Council on the Arts is doing and the
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
programming that they could enhance with
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
this money and our Council on the Arts
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
is a staff of about seven people to
 
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:27.299 align:start position:0%
magnify some of the work that they do to
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
support the Arts throughout the state
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we see a direct benefit to
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
Showcase uh the the creative economy
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that is booming
 
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
and everywhere in every region of the
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
state so there is a strategic Alliance
 
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
if you look at it that way with the
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
programming at New Hampshire public
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
television I do not work for New
 
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public television Peter Fred
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
who's the head of the New Hampshire
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
public television is here if there are
 
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
specific programming questions that I
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
would defer to him
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
um but uh I I'm here to answer any other
 
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.930 align:start position:0%
um but uh I I'm here to answer any other
questions

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:01.940 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
questions of the commissioner
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
I I think uh this amendment
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's Amendment came
 
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.390 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's Amendment came
up

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
while we were discussing the State
 
00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:18.230 align:start position:0%
while we were discussing the State
Library

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
Library
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
and in my mind
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
the billion dollars is better spent
 
00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:27.539 align:start position:0%
from a State library and rescuing the
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the things that we have over
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
there before there before it's too late
 
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
to rescue them
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
so in my mind this is a
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's really a trade-off
 
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.930 align:start position:0%
it's really a trade-off
between

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
public television which I think is
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
pretty well funded by the federal
 
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
government to begin with
 
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
and protecting our own
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
local resources held in by a State
 
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.090 align:start position:0%
local resources held in by a State
Library

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
would you like to comment on that or uh
 
00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
I believe the um the final
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
amount that was voted on for the State
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
library was 750 000 that's correct
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
um which was slightly less than the 1
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
million so maybe we have some
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
flexibility with this allocation to make
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
representative grassy
 
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any how much I mean are
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
we missing out on federal funds because
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
we're not being able to provide the
 
00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:27.830 align:start position:0%
we're not being able to provide the
match

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
match
 
00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
and what is that number if you know have
 
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
fanned okay so we have we have not in re
 
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
since I've been here so I can only speak
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
to recent history we have not missed out
 
00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
on federal funds we have had but we've
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
had to
 
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.610 align:start position:0%
had to
um

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh stress over it
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
um and and kind of
 
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:52.220 align:start position:0%
you know have a very uh cumbersome
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet to to prove to the Feds that
 
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
we are matching it with
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
um you know the hours that the staff
 
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
spends and other uh funding so no to be
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
honest we have not we have not had to
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
turn away Federal funding but it's
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's an honor
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
representative Kimbrell's no
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions on the
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.029 align:start position:0%
 
representable

00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
representable
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
having made the motion to put 750
 
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
000 plus a tour into HB 2 for purposes
 
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
of the library
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
um and following up on representative
 
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
Griffin's comment
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
would there be any interest or could I
 
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
persuade the division to maybe give if
 
00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
this is if if if the public TV funding
 
00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
is not going to be supported could we
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
put some more money into the library
 
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.169 align:start position:0%
put some more money into the library
effort

00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
I certainly would be supportive to put
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
the library amount back to a million
 
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
dollars if if this passes
 
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:18.380 align:start position:0%
would you want to add more than that
 
00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.250 align:start position:0%
would you want to add more than that
[Laughter]

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:21.260 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:24.419 align:start position:0%
we'll have two tours yeah whatever I'm
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire are you willing
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
to modify your Amendment
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
to add 250 total for the biennium back
 
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
to the library yeah all right sure
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
and that would be with the
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
reviso that this is supported well you
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
can add it to the segment right
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
all right is there a second to that
 
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions if the
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
okay I want to get this straight motion
 
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:10.460 align:start position:0%
to add
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
I think it's fun well this is uh this
 
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:24.620 align:start position:0%
would be one
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
moving the five hundred thousand dollars
 
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:30.140 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
it's a million overall but 500 000 per
 
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
year so a million
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
in hb1 I believe this is a budget line
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
is that right Melissa
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
I thought they were both HP one
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
guys no that's not a problem so when the
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
cleric is ready if she'll please call
 
00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
the roll we all clearance to support the
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
McGuire initial request to removing one
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars from New Hampshire
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
public television and restoring 250
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
000 to the library bringing that amount
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
to one million dollars
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
all right representative McGuire yes
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yes
 
00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:23.779 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney yes
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative cambrose yes
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
feel the same okay representative Hewitt
 
00:33:33.899 --> 00:33:36.110 align:start position:0%
feel the same okay representative Hewitt
yes

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.769 --> 00:33:44.779 align:start position:0%
representation yes chair I mean
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
who should I coordinate the tour with
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative Ebel after we get done
 
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:01.460 align:start position:0%
with the budget you got it
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
can't uh move on to two items that have
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
been hanging back here for a while we
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
have uh House Bill 436 relative to group
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
two retirement under transition
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
Provisions uh representative Maguire is
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
prepared an amendment maybe you will
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
speak to I'm wondering if we should take
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
them in the other order since
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
maybe we should save some money before
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
we spend it or
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
what do you think well it's up to you
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
you're offering to a different Amendment
 
00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
so if you'd like to take up 571 you're
 
00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
welcome to do that yeah I think of that
 
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:55.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
this is 4 37.
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
we actually don't have that Amendment
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
back problem oh well yeah okay there's
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
um yeah sure yeah okay so if as you
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
recall House Bill 571 was a cola
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it added to group two
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
um retirement so it was for those who
 
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
are retired at least 10 years already so
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and and it was a five percent Cola
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
for those retired 10 through 19 years
 
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
and then a 10 Cola for those retired 20
 
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
plus years right and it was a permanent
 
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
Cola so that that would be added to
 
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.170 align:start position:0%
Cola so that that would be added to
ongoing

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
um their ongoing retirement so
 
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm proposing I actually have two
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
versions of an amendment for you
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
um both of them are one-time payments
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're not ongoing permanent payments
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and they're both for the same group
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
um so the the overall cost is we asked
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
them what's the cost of one year's worth
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
of this bill of House Bill 571 the
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
answer was 8.8 million so it's it's
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
roughly in that picture in that ballpark
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and what what it what the two
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
amendments are slightly different in the
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
sense that
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
um one amendment is uh two thousand
 
00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
dollars I think this is right two
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the first group The
 
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
the 10 to 19 year group three thousand
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
dollars for the 20 plus group right
 
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and the other amendment is a ramp so
 
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
it starts it's a ramp that starts at one
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for those retired ten
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
years it's like twelve hundred dollars
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
for those 11 years fourteen hundred
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
dollars for those
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
Etc up to the three thousand dollars and
 
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
then it's the three thousand dollars for
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
those that are 20 plus years if you see
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
what I mean so there's there's no step
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
there's no big step in the in the Second
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment but
 
00:37:30.599 --> 00:37:32.810 align:start position:0%
Amendment but
um

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and and the other thing we add that
 
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
we added to it is
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
um an overall cap of a hundred thousand
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
dollars so if it's someone is already
 
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
has a has a pension of a hundred
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or more they would not
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
be getting these this one-time payment
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
could I just clarify it so we only have
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
one of the Amendments at this point I
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
mean I have I have zero eight nine
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
oh that's 436 okay so we don't know
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
sorry so we don't have
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
571. we don't we sent that to them
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
Saturday at six o'clock at night ish and
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
they informed me this morning they were
 
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
still working on it
 
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so it may be a little
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
premature yeah all right too far into
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
this okay unfortunately we don't have it
 
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
we hope that we would have it
 
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
all right all right well let's switch
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for doing it yeah all right so
 
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for doing it yeah all right so
um

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
but the concept is that right now on our
 
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
on our total our grand total
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 571 is 84 million this
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
would make it more like 10 you know
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
eight nine or ten something like that so
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
so that helps us balance the budget
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
significantly all right house bill 436.
 
00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:00.470 align:start position:0%
significantly all right house bill 436.
so

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
um this was a bill very strongly passed
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
the house and it you know this is a
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
truly bipartisan bill in the sense that
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
a majority of both the Democrats and the
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
majority of the Republicans voted for
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
this right obviously stronger on one
 
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
side than the other but but it was but
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
it you know it wasn't bipartisan in the
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
sense that you know it got all of this
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
and two of these or something like that
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
it it was a real bipartisan you know I
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
think that's the way the word should be
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
defined but anyways
 
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.589 align:start position:0%
defined but anyways
um

00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
but it's very expensive this is a very
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
expensive bill and we got this analysis
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
from the um
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
from from the retirement system
 
00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
that says so so the way the bill is
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
planned to spend is 25 million in in 10
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
years each each year for 10 years so
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
starting in fiscal year 25 so the second
 
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:06.740 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium
 
00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.329 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium
and

00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
um it has some other changes that add
 
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.390 align:start position:0%
um it has some other changes that add
um

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
so so it's a little bit confusing but it
 
00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:20.099 align:start position:0%
it adds uh this one point if you see the
 
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.099 align:start position:0%
paper here one essentially 1.7 percent
 
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
to the employer rates for police and
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
fire but the 25 million over time is
 
00:40:31.619 --> 00:40:32.710 align:start position:0%
fire but the 25 million over time is
like

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
22.7 million too much right so it it
 
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
lowers the unfunded liability by 22.7
 
00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:43.460 align:start position:0%
million but it does raise employer rates
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
by one point something
 
00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.109 align:start position:0%
by one point something
um

00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
per year
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
um so I've
 
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm proposing that we amend it that
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
we add it to house bill 2. but we amend
 
00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.710 align:start position:0%
we add it to house bill 2. but we amend
it

00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
slightly to make it a little bit less
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
expensive and that's by doing three
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
things so one of them was the amendment
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
we we agreed to last week right if you
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
remember the original Bill had a the
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
original bill has a hundred and twenty
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollar cap on
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
um the pensions for this group and it
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
and it had an accelerator for that cap
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
so so it would go up by one and a
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
quarter percent per year so we we took
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
off that change so so it's just flat
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's a flat cap
 
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.390 align:start position:0%
it's a flat cap
okay

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.890 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's that's in section five of
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
actually I thought that was five they
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
changed it so it's now
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
three is four I guess
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
yeah oh okay so it's that's in section
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
three of this bill
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
of this amendment the other thing that I
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
did was remove sections two and three of
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
the original bill so sections two and
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
three had to do with
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
what is
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
compensation all right so
 
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.630 align:start position:0%
compensation all right so
um

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
back in 2011
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
um compensation for this this group of
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
people was the average of the top three
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
years of of uh pay and it was changed to
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
the top five years and it also included
 
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
um special special duty pay things like
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
um if a police officer does uh
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
it helps out with a like a like an arena
 
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
event or something and gets extra pay I
 
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
think that was used to be counted and
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's no longer as counted so
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
by removing sections two and three we
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
keep the modern definition of what pay
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
is for this group
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
which is what it is now in law and we do
 
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
not revert it to the definition that was
 
00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:19.460 align:start position:0%
existing in 2011. okay
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
but this bill does keep the the main
 
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
expensive part of the part of the of the
 
00:43:27.609 --> 00:43:27.619 align:start position:0%
cost which is
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
that in 2011 this group
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
um the way their pension was calculated
 
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
was average final average compensation
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
times number of years of service times
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
two and a half percent
 
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
and what it was changed in 2011 so that
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
for some of this group it was now 2.4
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
percent and for some it was 2.3 percent
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
and some was 2.2 percent and so on
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
and so this Bill gets rid of that it
 
00:43:59.690 --> 00:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
puts all these people back at two and a
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
half percent but does it over time in a
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
way that encourages them to stay working
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
for another couple years beyond their
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
normal uh retirement
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:17.579 align:start position:0%
um it's phased in over time
 
00:44:17.579 --> 00:44:18.950 align:start position:0%
um it's phased in over time
and

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
um so all that's that part is is
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
unchanged from the original bill in this
 
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.770 align:start position:0%
unchanged from the original bill in this
amendment

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.329 align:start position:0%
amendment
so

00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's clear so so again
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
compared to the original Bill we kept
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
the definition of of
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
earned income
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
all right and we kept the cap changes
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
that we did last week but otherwise this
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
is the original Bill okay
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin would you like to
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair for the record uh
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin from the New Hampshire
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
retirement system who just saw this
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
amendment a minute ago oh okay it was
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
so you really haven't had a chance to
 
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
really go through it obviously no no
 
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
um I just off the top of my head the
 
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
changes to the definition of variable
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
compensation and the inclusion of unused
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
sick and vacation time are a significant
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
change to the bill and would uh lower
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
the cost significantly but again I
 
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
actually would have to tell us exactly
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
you know that that's that's a major
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
change in of a original bill
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
um the 125 uh raising the cab from 125
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
to 120 and not having that escalator in
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
it that was an amendment brought forth
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
at the committee accepted last week and
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
we provided the information LBA which
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
you have received over the weekend about
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
the cost decrease for that this would
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of the bill by an
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
indeterminate amount at this point
 
00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
um you know there's others who may want
 
00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
to speak about the policy implications
 
00:46:08.569 --> 00:46:08.579 align:start position:0%
but I you know that's really not our
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
place to
 
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
get into that
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
well seeing none I guess you get off the
 
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:20.579 align:start position:0%
book a little bit easier today I'll be
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
around is it possible that you could get
 
00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:25.460 align:start position:0%
us an analysis of the
 
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to have everything done
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
as you know by tomorrow
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative Griffin
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary necessarily a comment
 
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
I mean a question
 
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.210 align:start position:0%
I mean a question
but

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.710 align:start position:0%
but
I think

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
looking at this it's progress
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
but I think the reason we originally
 
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
they think we did
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh was it still needs a lot of work
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of money
 
00:47:05.339 --> 00:47:07.430 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of money
and

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we're gonna save it in
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
a day
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
and if we do we're probably going to
 
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
make Samaras
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
in the process of doing it well that's
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney I I agree that
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is a lot of money as originally
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
proposed but as representative McGuire
 
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
said it was a bill that bipartisan
 
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
support for the policy changes when it
 
00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
first came to the house as we craft the
 
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
budget looking to build a budget that we
 
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.670 align:start position:0%
budget looking to build a budget that we
can

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
can
pass

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.550 align:start position:0%
pass
um

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
we should be mindful of the costs and
 
00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're at least putting
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
away the money if we have to keep
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
working on the policy we keep working on
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
the policy but making sure we have a
 
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
home to fund it when we can get to a
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
conclusion again I don't know if we can
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
do that by tomorrow's deadline of
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
getting the our section of the budget
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
out of this division but we should be
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
mindful of this this large moving piece
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
and making sure that we find a home for
 
00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.990 align:start position:0%
and making sure that we find a home for
it

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
um whatever we can however we can do
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Sweeney uh
 
00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you have anything
 
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
else to add or
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
well I maybe I should say the motivation
 
00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
for taking out sections two and three
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
so sections two and three are what we
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
would call we used to call spiking right
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
so the idea is that because pensions are
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
based on the the highest three earning
 
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
years of compensation or well now five
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
but at the time three
 
00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:52.250 align:start position:0%
but at the time three
um

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
what employees were able to do and you
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
know what it's not there there's any
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
blame involved I mean it's just it is
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
what it is is by working lots of
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
overtime or extra Duty or whatever in
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
their final few years they were able to
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
make a much higher pension than they
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
would have had otherwise
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
and the problem is the money to pay for
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
those higher pensions wasn't being saved
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
over their working career right the
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
money being saved over their working
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
career to pay for pensions is based on
 
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
their current salaries and then the
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
amount of overtime they work and all
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
that other stuff but but to have a
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
mechanism that allows employees to to
 
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
sort of artificially boost their final
 
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:40.250 align:start position:0%
sort of artificially boost their final
pay

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
is problematic for the retirement system
 
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.990 align:start position:0%
is problematic for the retirement system
because

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:47.099 align:start position:0%
there's no money in it to cover those
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
things right so that was the reason that
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
those changes were made and they were
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
made not just for group two but for all
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
the groups right for the entire system
 
00:49:59.690 --> 00:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
so the entire system uses a fairly
 
00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.670 align:start position:0%
so the entire system uses a fairly
consistent

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:05.579 align:start position:0%
um since 2011 definition of final pay of
 
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
average final compensation so so that's
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
why I think it's it you know asking to
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
change that particular part is not
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
really reasonable in my in my opinion
 
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
but the other parts are more reasonable
 
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
so the division we want to look at this
 
00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:30.140 align:start position:0%
for another couple of hours another day
 
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
I see nodding heads
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know we only have a day we have to
 
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
have everything done as you know
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow representative evil
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
well I would just say in the meantime
 
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
we'd also get the 571 and then
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
discussions and um I think all of that
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
would filter into our brains when we
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
make a final decision
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
all right I think we should also look at
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
oh the uh communication communication
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
delete interest and yeah okay interest
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
in dividends that's kind of connected
 
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.970 align:start position:0%
in dividends that's kind of connected
too

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
all right so hopefully we'll have some
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
information uh the language for both of
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
these amendments uh maybe by this
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon Melissa can we kind of I know
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
it's hard to push them across the street
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
but I will reach out to them again and
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully be able to get you something
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
by this afternoon because representative
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
McGuire and I spoke of some significant
 
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
changes over the weekend uh that I think
 
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
the division needs to hear about too and
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
at the same time we have those
 
00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
amendments do you have the tax related
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
changes yeah oh you do have those okay
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so why don't we pass those out the
 
00:51:46.809 --> 00:51:46.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.819 --> 00:51:48.770 align:start position:0%
 
laughs

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
so for the folks that came to hear the
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on these two retirement bills
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like we'll be hearing
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
anything directly as far as until we get
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
the Amendments from OLS the other one is
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 250.
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
we should probably talk about that yeah
 
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
because we're going to be conducting
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
that today so right I'm hoping we can
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
like at 11 o'clock get to the other
 
00:52:20.819 --> 00:52:27.250 align:start position:0%
like at 11 o'clock get to the other
issues

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:27.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:46.609 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:52:46.609 --> 00:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
if we pass House Bill 436 whether the
 
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
way I said in this amendment or some
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
other way
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
it means we're going to need a revenue
 
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.510 align:start position:0%
it means we're going to need a revenue
source

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
source
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
to pay for it over a long period of time
 
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
right because it spends money for 10
 
00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.089 align:start position:0%
right because it spends money for 10
years

00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
and so the obvious place to look there
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
is the communication Services tax right
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax in the budget
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
goes away
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
um this this biennium and it's 58
 
00:53:29.329 --> 00:53:29.339 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry a year 58 million 56 million
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
the biennium right right all right sorry
 
00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
you're right 28 million a year 29.
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436 25 a year right rough up
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
rough balance there and so and it's an
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing a possible ongoing source of
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue so
 
00:53:58.329 --> 00:53:58.339 align:start position:0%
um so what this bill does
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
is restore the communication Services
 
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
tax that's line one
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
but as a kind of compensation
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
for the part of the committee myself
 
00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
included who like tax cuts
 
00:54:13.859 --> 00:54:15.670 align:start position:0%
included who like tax cuts
it

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
sunsets the interest in dividends tax
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
two years earlier than it otherwise
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
would in current law so in current law
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax is being
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
said and set on January 1st 2027 this
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
would make it January 1st 2025.
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the way it's written in this
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
amendment is actually a net plus for
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
this particular budget so for this
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
particular biennium it's roughly I think
 
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
we've decided a 24 million dollar
 
00:54:58.790 --> 00:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
plus it will be a negative to the next
 
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.130 align:start position:0%
plus it will be a negative to the next
biennium

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:00.140 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
by I estimate roughly 40 million dollars
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
but ongoing for future bienniums it's a
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
net plus of of uh 50 something billion
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
for the bienniums right so so enough to
 
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
cover effectively enough to cover the
 
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
house bill 436 costs
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and I think that you know that should
 
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
appeal to those who want House Bill 436
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
and it should appeal to those who would
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
like to see the interest in dividends
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
tax sunset
 
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
comments representative Sweeney thank
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:55:49.609 --> 00:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
um I support moving up the phase out of
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends
 
00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I like the idea that we're
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
restoring the communications tax to find
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
the home for 436 and sort of
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
incorporating it there with based on my
 
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
my brain
 
00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
um the uh I mean I haven't yeah so the
 
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
the revenue from the Communication
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
Service acts would fund would bring in
 
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
more than the cost of 436 as we amended
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
it on Friday correct
 
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
so that would even out there a little
 
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
bit and then it's the the 436 is the
 
00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
10-year increase so can we
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
would we also be able to based on the
 
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard from uh the tax
 
00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
office the service tax continues to go
 
00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:37.849 align:start position:0%
office the service tax continues to go
down

00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
so maybe even in in this bill in this
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
budget include that in 10 years once 436
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
is funded the Communication Service tax
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
is abolished is the returns for that 10
 
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
years from now when we're 90 using data
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
for phone calls anyways is going to be
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
minimal so that's just my but I think we
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
can find through this find the home for
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
436 as we mentioned on Friday
 
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
and and move forward with with a tax cut
 
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
that a portion of the house uh would
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
like to say represent McGuire thank you
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I'm willing to let
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
whoever's sitting in this chair it will
 
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
not be me
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
representative camber house thank you
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I also like this
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
plan because I I want to do what's right
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
with 436 but we have to we must fund it
 
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
and I think that the communications tax
 
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
is a great way to go about it as long as
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
we can you know appease Everyone by also
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
pulling in the dividend and interest tax
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
um my question would be to
 
00:57:50.089 --> 00:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
um your other Amendment so we know that
 
00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
the initial bill is 25 million dollars a
 
00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
year what would the your other Amendment
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
do to that 25 is it bring it down a
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
little because that's what I like to
 
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.049 align:start position:0%
little because that's what I like to
know

00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
the I think
 
00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:08.579 align:start position:0%
um I don't know specific yes it makes it
 
00:58:08.579 --> 00:58:09.589 align:start position:0%
um I don't know specific yes it makes it
less

00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
the amount less is is unknown presumably
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
um it won't be known by the when the
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
house it won't necessarily be known when
 
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
the house has to act on on the budget
 
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day I mean when it
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
gets to the Senate and and when we get
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
to the committee of conference then we
 
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
will have a much clearer picture but it
 
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
is less yeah okay Paul so my opinion on
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
that then is that everybody has to give
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
a little here and I believe that they
 
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get the whole ball
 
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
of wax but they're going to get most of
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
it and I do believe everyone has to give
 
00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
into this in order to kind of make
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
everybody happy and so I like your plan
 
00:58:56.569 --> 00:58:56.579 align:start position:0%
and I think also what you did was fair
 
00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
because like you said when you talked
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
about the spiking that is a known issue
 
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
and uh and and I think it's it's right
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
for everyone to give into this for the
 
00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the HR 17 from house
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
ways and means that they presented and
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
we tabled and what it says for the
 
00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
interests and dividends and tax for 2024
 
00:59:32.359 --> 00:59:34.630 align:start position:0%
interests and dividends and tax for 2024
is

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
112.8 million and for 2025 it's 89.4
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
and the CST
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
is 28
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
0.9 and 28.9 so there's a radical
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
difference between the two numbers
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
so I know I mean we don't have like the
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
the analysis yes we do actually you do
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if you have it to hand
 
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
out but we did get a kind of breakdown
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
from dra year by year of what the
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax collects
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
sure I don't have it I don't have it to
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
hand out at this moment this moment can
 
01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:17.579 align:start position:0%
get ready it is based it's based on the
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
um they're 22 collections so it wasn't
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
updated with the HR 17 yet
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
so I can explain so
 
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
under this proposal
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
only the last six months of the interest
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
and dividends tax from this biennium the
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
current biennium will go away so we
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
would have the hundred and whatever the
 
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
the first years fiscal year 24's value
 
01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:47.900 align:start position:0%
unchanged fiscal year 25's value
 
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
would go down but
 
01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.030 align:start position:0%
would go down but
it's

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
not by half of that value so that that
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
value is 89 million right but it would
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
go down by roughly a third of that value
 
01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.809 align:start position:0%
go down by roughly a third of that value
because

01:01:04.809 --> 01:01:04.819 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's the the interest in dividends tax
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
is charged on that on a calendar year
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
basis so so this the six months you're
 
01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.849 align:start position:0%
basis so so this the six months you're
missing

01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
missing
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
it's the rate is already programmed to
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
go down if you see what I mean like it's
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
three percent the first six months and
 
01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
and two percent the second six months of
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
25 okay so so it isn't very much this is
 
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
the point okay thank you um
 
01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.530 align:start position:0%
the point okay thank you um
so

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself I would be in favor
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
of restoring the CST but I really don't
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
see why there has to be a trade-off here
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know why we can't just restore
 
01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
the CST to help fund
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
hb436 and leave everything the way it is
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
I mean like all of you I sat through the
 
01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:05.900 align:start position:0%
hearing last week I listened to the
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
unbelievable needs of folks that have
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
developed mentally disabled children
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
that have disabled children there's
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
nursing home issues there's so many many
 
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
things and while I support doing the
 
01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:24.980 align:start position:0%
right thing on 4 36 I couldn't support
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
trading off IND for CST I would rather
 
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
it would appear that we're heading for
 
01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:41.180 align:start position:0%
an impasse which I hope we can avoid
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative grassy
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
first of all I'd just like to make one
 
01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
comment is having served on the
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
Rochester city council for many years
 
01:02:50.049 --> 01:02:50.059 align:start position:0%
the spiking Clause is something that
 
01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
spiking issue is certainly something
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
that I 100 support you on because I
 
01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
think it's something that needs to be
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed and it was
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
something that we all anguished over
 
01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
every year when we saw our payments come
 
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
through but
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
um I think that as far and I support it
 
01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
it's great to see that you've you know
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
decide that you know we need to keep the
 
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
communications tax because we and and to
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
fund this this you know the particular
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
things that we have to do in the
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
retirement system and that's that's good
 
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
but I think that you know representative
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
evil did mention that after the public
 
01:03:26.089 --> 01:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
hearing that we had the other day and
 
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
some of the reimbursement rates that are
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
far inadequate that we have for services
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
that are out there right now to make a
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
judgment on this now uh for the interest
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax
 
01:03:41.809 --> 01:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
um would would not be a responsible
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
thing to do at the end
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
when we can see what we have funded and
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
what we are unable to fund or what we
 
01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
decide not to fund then that may be a
 
01:03:53.809 --> 01:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
better time to look at it because if the
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
budget comes out and we have more money
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
than we need
 
01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.370 align:start position:0%
than we need
then

01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
but if we don't have more money we need
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
and we see that there are important
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
things that the citizens of our state
 
01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:05.150 align:start position:0%
things that the citizens of our state
need

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
then you know we may want to look at
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
this as a way to fund some of those
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
programs that we unfortunately because
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
of a cut like this we may be maybe
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
having to cut
 
01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
and I would instead of having to cut
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
particularly like reimbursement rates
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
which should be higher and other
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
programs I mean we don't we still don't
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
know what the other divisions are
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
bringing in uh and until we do I think
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
we uh it would be responsible to to take
 
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
this action
 
01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
representable hi I just had I just had
 
01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
one other comment I actually went back
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
and I looked at the live stream uh on
 
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
ways and means when they were assessing
 
01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:52.220 align:start position:0%
uh bills that related to the CST repeal
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
that they looked at bills that were
 
01:04:59.690 --> 01:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
accelerating the phase out of IND there
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
was discussion at that point about
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about revenue and they felt
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
that none of those decisions should be
 
01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
made at this time and they retained all
 
01:05:13.569 --> 01:05:13.579 align:start position:0%
the bills and
 
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
I would argue that we're interposing the
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
Judgment of ways and means who are the
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
experts on this
 
01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
um for our own in making a decision like
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
this and again they actually did retain
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
a bill on the basis of concern about
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
revenues that would be repeal the CST I
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
think at some point we thought maybe
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
they were leaving the decision to us and
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
maybe they kind of were but that is not
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
what was stated on during the retain
 
01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.890 align:start position:0%
what was stated on during the retain
hearing

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:50.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
Melissa and Mr Hoffman would you reach
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
out to commissioner stepp and get
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
something fairly quickly from her as far
 
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
as accelerating the repeal
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
and with the impact it would have
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
because we we have a lot of numbers in
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
the air and as far as ways and means we
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
accepted their recommendations but we
 
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:13.700 align:start position:0%
have to as we all know make a decision
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't be nice to have the
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
Commissioners weigh in on that
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
chairman speaking to
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
seek consensus and compromise which can
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a bad word if we are
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
smart about it there's a coalition of
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
the of the Full House and within this
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
Division and within our overall
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
committee that wants to see
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
that that likes the idea of getting rid
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
of the Communication Service tax there's
 
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
a coalition along very similar lines
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
that would like to speed up the phase
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
out of interest and dividends that we
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
started in the last budget and and make
 
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
that work so that it phases out sooner
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a coalition it's pretty
 
01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
broad that wants 436 and likes the
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
amendment from Friday that we discussed
 
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
and had we don't have the analysis fully
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
yet of the amendment that was brought
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
forward today in my head it does seem
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
clear that we can trade
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
the Communication Service tax repeal
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
that was proposed in the governor's
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
budget speed up the interest in
 
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
dividends tax cut and phase out to give
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
those that want to reduce taxes
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
something to cheer on in this budget and
 
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
incorporate and settle for the 436 as
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
amended on Friday
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
and and that should be something that
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
the numbers in my head seem to work and
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
that could be something that this
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
division can get behind unanimously sell
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
it to the full finance and and let's
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
just do a Voice vote for the budget and
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
three that last part was a joke that was
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
a joke yeah but I I think with all these
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
elements all these all the balls were
 
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
juggling in the air right now we can
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
catch them all and we can make it work
 
01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
where everybody's not getting everything
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
they want but we're all getting
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
something that we can go home and be
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
proud of and we can talk to our groups
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
and our people that we're here to
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
represent and say hey I went in fighting
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
for this we got this and that's still a
 
01:08:17.329 --> 01:08:17.339 align:start position:0%
good thing that we can say we accomplish
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
for the people of New Hampshire
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
obviously there's going to be other
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
parts of the budget where we're going to
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
fight tooth and nail on I think in our
 
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
division with these being kind of the
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
the home stretch for where our budget's
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
going to end up we can
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
436 from Friday
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
restore the Communication Service tax
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
and the idea that it will fund 436 from
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
Friday for the next 10 years and speed
 
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
up the interest in dividends tax for a
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
minimal budget impact this budget in
 
01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
order to just show people that we all
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
gave up a little but we're all in the
 
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:51.799 align:start position:0%
end getting pretty substantially a lot
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
so that's my two cents that's my way of
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
thinking before seeing fiscal notes on
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
on any various thing I think that's
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
where we can come together as a division
 
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully as a finance
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
committee on those areas so that's what
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
I would advocate for and be supportive
 
01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
of in this uh final stretch
 
01:09:14.169 --> 01:09:14.179 align:start position:0%
well said representative Sweeney
 
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and I met with Mr
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
Kane this morning and some other folks
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
from the different divisions and our
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
division is in very good shape right now
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
we actually could based on some of the
 
01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:29.060 align:start position:0%
decisions we make today
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
pass some money over to uh division
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
three for Home Care bring that
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
percentage up from 3.1 to maybe more is
 
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
another way of bringing people to the
 
01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.390 align:start position:0%
another way of bringing people to the
table

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
um and this division has worked very
 
01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:48.299 align:start position:0%
well you'll find representative grassy
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
being new but we've worked very well in
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
reaching many good compromises I think
 
01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
and to get a budget through we need to
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
compromise we cannot go to the house
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
floor without a budget that is passed
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
because we've been there before I think
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin and maybe McGuire
 
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
and I and representative evil have
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
witnessed what happens when a budget
 
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
goes down the house is no position with
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate so we need to get somewhere
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
in representative cambrell's yes thank
 
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair again representative
 
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
Sweeney said it all I think it was
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
perfect and I I think that
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
um it's incumbent upon us to be one of
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
those divisions that sends
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations with you know good solid
 
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
numbers behind them because this this is
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
that critical and uh and I think that
 
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
this compromise that we've discussed
 
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win for everyone I mean
 
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
everybody maybe doesn't get 100 but
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
everybody gets 90 95 percent out of this
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's a great compromise
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
thank you did you get any indication
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
Melissa or Mike when we might get any
 
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
response from OLS as far as the
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
um for the 571 I just got an email
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
saying they were just about done with
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment and they're working
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
on the Second Amendment and they'll hope
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
to have it back to me today
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
all right and able to send an email to
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner Steph's office or I sent
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
her an email while we were sitting here
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
asking for that perfect practical impact
 
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
of the IND repeal using HR 17 data all
 
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
right representative McGuire no
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
representation oh I'm sorry
 
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as this latest Amendment
 
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.890 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as this latest Amendment
uh

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
I think it's my problem all along with
 
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.930 align:start position:0%
I think it's my problem all along with
4436

01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
4436
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
has been that we were encumbering
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
future legislators
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we should do
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I think this amendment
 
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.550 align:start position:0%
and I think this amendment
by

01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
salvaging the communications tax to pay
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
what we doing 436
 
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
and as a trade-off speed up the
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
interests and dividends thing it seems
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
to me like it's a workable solution
 
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
um we don't encumber a future a future
 
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.390 align:start position:0%
um we don't encumber a future a future
legislator

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
legislature and uh
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
from my viewpoint that's very important
 
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of the problems that we're
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
come from the past and I think we have
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
to be careful not to leave
 
01:12:44.649 --> 01:12:44.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
appreciate

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
far and I too want a bipartisan solution
 
01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I'd say is that one
 
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that the governor gave
 
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
for getting rid of the CST is that he
 
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
thought it was a decreasing Revenue
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
source so even though we can argue that
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
this will pay for um
 
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
436 going forward there is not
 
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
necessarily a guarantee of that
 
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
um because again it was already a
 
01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.270 align:start position:0%
um because again it was already a
declining

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
declining
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
resource so and as far as you know
 
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh satisfy some folks on the on having a
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
tax cut in this budget I would say that
 
01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
the IND is already being phased out on a
 
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
schedule that is a tax cut and I'm not
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
sure that we need to
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
accelerate it even more to to have
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
another tax cut so that would be I I
 
01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:00.020 align:start position:0%
think for my caucus it would be very
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
difficult to make this agreement
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
let me talk about why the interest and
 
01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
dividends tax is
 
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
um problem is important
 
01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:19.130 align:start position:0%
um problem is important
um

01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
so in my mind
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
this tax is is economically the most
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
destructive one we have
 
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.930 align:start position:0%
destructive one we have
um

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
in general in order in order to improve
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
the economy
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
the we need to have savings savings is
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
how savings is what makes tomorrow
 
01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
better than today
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
right and and in general in economic
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
terms that's happiness right if you're
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
cons if tomorrow is better than today
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
um you you feel good right you things
 
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
are better so things are improving
 
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
improving over time
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
but in economic terms in order to make
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow better than today you can't
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
consume everything you create today you
 
01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
have to save
 
01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
and the interest in dividends tax is a
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
direct tax on savings
 
01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
right so it's something we actually want
 
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
to encourage not discourage when you tax
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
something you get less of it and we do
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
that explicitly in many ways right we
 
01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
tax cigarettes we tax liquor we tax
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
things with that we deliberately want to
 
01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.050 align:start position:0%
things with that we deliberately want to
discourage

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
discourage
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
um the communication tax is a
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
consumption type tax it's a it's a it's
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
it discourages a little bit
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
talking on the phone all right but it
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have broader Economic
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
Consequences in the way that the
 
01:15:56.209 --> 01:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax does because
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividends tax is a tax
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
on Capital formation and its attacks on
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
savings and savings is what makes the
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
economy get better over time so it's
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
important to to Really Sunset it and and
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment is saying to both sides
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
let's take the bird in the hand
 
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
for the two in the bush right so that
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
sorry represent grassy if I could just
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
ask a question representative McGuire
 
01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
how much savings do you have to have in
 
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
the bank before you have to start paying
 
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax because if
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken there is an exemption
 
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
that you only stop paying after a
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
certain amount I mean how much money
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
would you have to have in the bank
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
before you stop paying that tax
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
if you're asking about the details yeah
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
it does have a I think it's
 
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
twenty four hundred dollars if you're
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
you're asking about
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
of there's a minimum right so you have
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
to have it's it's charging you five
 
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
percent of your interest and dividends
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
once it's over I think it's 2400 it's
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
different for a couple and for a single
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing yeah but I don't know
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
the details what's the and by the way
 
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
that you would have to have in the bank
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
is what I'm interested in
 
01:17:17.159 --> 01:17:18.290 align:start position:0%
is what I'm interested in
oh

01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
well that just depends on how you invest
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.410 align:start position:0%
right so
um

01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it depends on what kind of
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
stocks you have what kind of portfolio
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
and it basically affects the retirees
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
who the uh one of their biggest sources
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
of income in retirement is their
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
dividends and their interests on their
 
01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
Investments so
 
01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:44.900 align:start position:0%
we're moving a little off topic
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
we need to uh get back to uh where we
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
were a little earlier once we get the
 
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
information from the commissioner and
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
the draft amendments which we're waiting
 
01:17:59.330 --> 01:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
on will get back into this deeper but I
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate everybody's comments uh
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
as you all know we have a number of
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
bills most the bills being exact this
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon are ours except one and at
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
some point probably at 11 30 I want to
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
just go over everything so everybody
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
knows where they are and what they have
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
to speak to if they have forgotten uh
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
Janet's working on that sheet as soon as
 
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
she has that we'll have that in front of
 
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
us but
 
01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
maybe if we could move to um
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
areas that we have to button up and
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's the uh additional requests there
 
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
are a number we have a sheet given to us
 
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
on Friday
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
and as you recall we acted on the
 
01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
and addressed three out of six items
 
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
but as you'll see below that sheet if
 
01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:53.540 align:start position:0%
you have it in front of you that's dated
 
01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.430 align:start position:0%
you have it in front of you that's dated
316

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
316
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
there are a number of items that uh it
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
says sheet here okay
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
so moving if anyone doesn't have it
 
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.130 align:start position:0%
so moving if anyone doesn't have it
um

01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman's got a brand new sheet for
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
us with the updates
 
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be perfect that would be
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
perfect save everyone from trying to dig
 
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:22.739 align:start position:0%
so the new one will show the changes
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
we've already done so it makes it a
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
little easier to follow we didn't do
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
many last week but it gives you a better
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
so you see there's a significant amount
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it adds up when you start telling
 
01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
people that give us your want was uh
 
01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
so agriculture marketing and food see
 
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
additional position is there are there
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.450 --> 01:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative McGuire is giving me a
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
muffled yes
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's a muffled no no
 
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
they should have yeah I don't remember
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
them making a strong case
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
all right did they make a strong case
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
for this I don't really remember I don't
 
01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
recall to be honest did you just
 
01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:49.669 align:start position:0%
recall to be honest did you just
um

01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
aren't we recommending passage of a bill
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
to help with their I.T we did do that
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
yeah we did do that
 
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
so that's a no is everybody okay with
 
01:21:01.729 --> 01:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
that but if I may I I wasn't here for
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
the presentation it was before me but uh
 
01:21:05.689 --> 01:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
the thing is having worked with the soil
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
conservation services in the past as a
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
town planner I found that they were very
 
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
very uh supportive I don't know what
 
01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
this position does uh but the thing is
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
is that towns and municipalities uh when
 
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
there's construction going on in their
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
communities or plans being presented
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
these people have been tremendously
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
helpful to us and I don't know what
 
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
again I don't know what this position is
 
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
but if it's one that services and
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
provides technical support to the
 
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.890 align:start position:0%
provides technical support to the
communities

01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
um I would think it would be of
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
tremendous value with the development
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's going on and conservation
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
situations Mr Hoffman any recollection
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh I know they've already got folks
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
embedded doing this this is an
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
additional yes this was a request in the
 
01:21:47.219 --> 01:21:48.229 align:start position:0%
additional yes this was a request in the
um

01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
to the governor's budget phase to be
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
generally funded position but when the
 
01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner came into division one
 
01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
he said that they would be able to fund
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
it from this fund so it wouldn't be
 
01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to change your yeah if it's
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
other funds it's not right yeah all
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
right uh then we're okay with that
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
moving down to board of texts and land
 
01:22:15.719 --> 01:22:18.470 align:start position:0%
moving down to board of texts and land
Appeals

01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
it's a small amount of money it's a
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
case management database 19
 
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
000. yeah I mean I totally support this
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
yeah they seem kind of struggling so
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:40.699 align:start position:0%
it is kind of double County
 
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
in my uh you're smiling so I know you
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
want to explain how it is done two
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
different funds yeah
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's one amount of money that is counted
 
01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
twice the way they budget the transfers
 
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.270 align:start position:0%
twice the way they budget the transfers
so

01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
in the office of information
 
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
technology they have an expense but the
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
source of the money for that expense is
 
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
a transfer from the other department
 
01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
at the end of house bill one there's a
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
netting out of that so you can see the
 
01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
the gross minus the interagency
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
transfers to give you a net number
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
so you're right it's coming from General
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
but then it will show up on doit as
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
other but it's really General funds but
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
they show it as others coming from the
 
01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
agency but it's it's rather confusing
 
01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
how it's done but so we're okay with
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay we have uh the request from the
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
Small Business Development Center for
 
01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.729 --> 01:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
again I'm a kind of a loss anybody
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
recall it was a hundred and ten thousand
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
Representatives I I remember it I think
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
they had uh 390
 
01:24:01.729 --> 01:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
000 and when we talked about it during
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
the hearing and um uh commissioner
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
Caswell was definitely supportive of the
 
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
increase we had a fairly convincing
 
01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
document letter that outlined for us why
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
the increase was worthwhile they really
 
01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
helped support small businesses and I
 
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
was uh quite struck by uh maybe you guys
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
got the email this week I think it went
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
to all legislators from the SBA and
 
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
their small business of the year was
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
from Mont Vernon and they quoted them
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
with in very glowing terms about how
 
01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
great this fund is
 
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
um I mean if people didn't want to go
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
the full 110 maybe we could at least get
 
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
get them up to 450 from 390 I think
 
01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.850 align:start position:0%
 
further

01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative McGuire yeah I'm
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
looking at the grand total and Page four
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
11 million dollars yeah so I'm worried
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have this kind of money so well
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
the more we spend in general we'll find
 
01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:09.830 align:start position:0%
the more we spend in general we'll find
soon

01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
soon
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.890 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I to me this would be a low
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
I don't mind just putting it on hold and
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
then we'll just wander our way through
 
01:25:59.530 --> 01:25:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
well I'm just like so the big hunk here
 
01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:05.219 align:start position:0%
is the case management system I don't I
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
don't remember very well the discussion
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:24.500 align:start position:0%
Bots well they kind of need
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
again this is
 
01:26:33.169 --> 01:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
these are all things that were presented
 
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
to the governor
 
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
and he did not include in his budget
 
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
and so unless unless in their
 
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
presentation before us
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
they made a very strong case
 
01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.189 align:start position:0%
they made a very strong case
uh

01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
I would think we'd go along with the
 
01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
executive department
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.129 --> 01:27:07.139 align:start position:0%
wild Advocate obviously has its hands
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
full so you know
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
this is really hard because none of us
 
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
remember what's ahead of us here to make
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
judgments along the way so I mean this
 
01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
is another one there are some of these
 
01:27:22.729 --> 01:27:22.739 align:start position:0%
numbers are so small maybe we could help
 
01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
them out after we look at what the the
 
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
other things are we could just come back
 
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
to it I mean I'd argue the same thing
 
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
from the Human Rights Commission I mean
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
they made they really sounded like they
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
were stressed to the max
 
01:27:38.159 --> 01:27:39.470 align:start position:0%
were stressed to the max
um

01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:42.169 --> 01:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know what
 
01:27:42.179 --> 01:27:43.610 align:start position:0%
I don't know what
could

01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
we have to be cautious
 
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
not much we hold here because again I
 
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
know well I'm just looking the D.O.T
 
01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
stuff is a lot of just text well the
 
01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
doit stuff is off mostly all other I
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
believe and it's just a double
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
accounting to put it easy yes
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative yes Mr chair I would be
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
inclined to maybe give them the obvious
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
little things that they would need like
 
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
additional training and then State and
 
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
out of state travel and kill the rest
 
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
so they get the basic stuff that they
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
need the those three things are obvious
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
and then again I don't recall the case
 
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
management system you know being some
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know I listen pretty attentively
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
to all the presentations and I don't
 
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
really recall a great case for that
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
being made so and the LBA has ranked
 
01:28:36.169 --> 01:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
he's based on what they suggest you'll
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
see the Bold numbers that was there I
 
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
believe ranking
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
yeah actually we took where the agencies
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
gave us rankings we used their
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
priorities yeah
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
so kill one five through seven and keep
 
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
two three and four would be my
 
01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.990 align:start position:0%
two three and four would be my
recommendation

01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:58.450 --> 01:28:58.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
it's a two three and four is that
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
correct representative cameras that's
 
01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:08.270 align:start position:0%
correct representative cameras that's
correct

01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
can't have it it's a big number
 
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you I just
 
01:29:16.129 --> 01:29:16.139 align:start position:0%
want clarify so PR representative is
 
01:29:18.890 --> 01:29:18.900 align:start position:0%
press relations public relations or
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
something or training and training
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
there's not like another acronym in the
 
01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
child advocate
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
dichotomy then Melissa PR it's a public
 
01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
all right it would appear that we're
 
01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
pretty close to two three and four
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
Mike and Melissa add those three items
 
01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.030 align:start position:0%
Mike and Melissa add those three items
please

01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
again that was another we heard they
 
01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
were struggling as far as um
 
01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
their workload and behind and I think
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
they also told us as they closed cases
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
and somebody can correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
that they get some federal matching
 
01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
money is that correct Melissa or Mike am
 
01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.179 --> 01:30:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
they do receive some federal
 
01:30:09.719 --> 01:30:11.810 align:start position:0%
they do receive some federal
participation

01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of case they're
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
working on I guess some of those cases
 
01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
are available to be covered by federal
 
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
all right thoughts from
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
this is representative cameras well yeah
 
01:30:33.649 --> 01:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
my recollection was that they weren't
 
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
very good with the math and they were
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
showing that they were closing more
 
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
cases every year and yet the caseload
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
they were getting new cases but they
 
01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
were closing more cases and they were
 
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
getting new and yet their total raw
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
caseload just stayed steady so they
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%
didn't make a great presentation my
 
01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
opinion in terms of knowing their
 
01:30:59.090 --> 01:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
numbers and they seem to I wouldn't I
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
would not vote for any of these
 
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.330 align:start position:0%
would not vote for any of these
positions

01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:05.780 align:start position:0%
further comments represents Sweden yeah
 
01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cameras for
 
01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
jogging me I remember I think in one
 
01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
column they had the average of each
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
month versus the actual for the last
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
year and that kind of made the the chart
 
01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
didn't make sense so I do recall what
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're referencing all right let's
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin I'll just add
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
that I had a constituent who had a
 
01:31:29.639 --> 01:31:30.770 align:start position:0%
that I had a constituent who had a
problem

01:31:30.770 --> 01:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
his problem became my problem I had
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
great difficulty getting a hold of them
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
and getting satisfactory and
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
representative evil I mean that that
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
could be a staffing issue I don't know
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
they seemed like they were really
 
01:31:50.689 --> 01:31:50.699 align:start position:0%
strained but these are also large
 
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
numbers so
 
01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:53.689 align:start position:0%
numbers so
I'm

01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
if the division prefers not to fund it
 
01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
if the division prefers not to fund it
right

01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
okay it seems a consensus that we will
 
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
not uh go with these extra priorities
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm sorry to go back to the
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
child advocate but I did have a question
 
01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
on this where it says case management
 
01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
system two hundred thousand dollars and
 
01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
then for fiscal 2024 it shows 700 are
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
they planning on spending it in 2020
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
I just wondered because 700 is a really
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
low number that's probably just the
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:32.930 align:start position:0%
 
yeah that's

01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead no I was just gonna well
 
01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:43.139 align:start position:0%
they're looking but I'd hate
 
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:45.500 align:start position:0%
I think they have just an unbelievable
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
responsibility and they have all these
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
issues and if giving them a little more
 
01:32:53.090 --> 01:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
money for their
 
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:56.699 align:start position:0%
case management system would help them I
 
01:32:59.090 --> 01:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
still I don't know so I just wanted to
 
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
go back to that and understand the
 
01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:03.050 align:start position:0%
go back to that and understand the
spending

01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
spending
 
01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
well I put a yes Melissa
 
01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
just reading their notes really quickly
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
and I think they got most of the
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
spending already in 2022 to implement
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
this and this was just the last bit that
 
01:33:16.129 --> 01:33:16.139 align:start position:0%
they needed to finish off their system
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
but it's a 200 000 or is it 700 it's 200
 
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
000 with the last bit I mean 500 000 in
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
the next uh in fiscal year 2025.
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
of 700 in 20 25 minutes correct I I
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.169 --> 01:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll but listen to Mr
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
chairman so they've got a system which
 
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
they've been working on and spending
 
01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
money on but they haven't completed and
 
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
if we don't fund it it's going to be
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
sitting there uncompleted
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that doesn't make sense right
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.970 --> 01:33:57.980 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at their handout and
 
01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
they talk about the system improvements
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
will allow for better ability to track
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
state agency child and child serving
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
agencies compliance with contracts laws
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
policies procedures without this
 
01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
enhancement the office will have delayed
 
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
or insufficient data capture
 
01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:19.739 align:start position:0%
and less timely investigations related
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
directly to Children's current safety
 
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
and well-being
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
the office will also have decreased
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
capacity measure outcomes provide timely
 
01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
relevant recommendations for system
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I guess my concern hearing that is if
 
01:34:40.490 --> 01:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's so important why wasn't it Priority
 
01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin and I fall back
 
01:34:51.649 --> 01:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
on why didn't the governor put it in the
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
budget if it was so important if it was
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
a half done project or something
 
01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:00.260 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll continue to move on
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
and if you get any more information
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
Melissa and Mike on that or I'm sure
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
people are watching you might hear
 
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
something more but
 
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
next we have
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
the department of Information Technology
 
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
and again this is uh
 
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
all other funds but they're not really
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
other funds because they come from
 
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
either general or federal or other other
 
01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:26.990 align:start position:0%
either general or federal or other other
funds

01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
so any thoughts um
 
01:35:31.129 --> 01:35:31.139 align:start position:0%
we heard all these representative
 
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
McGuire yeah I kind of like one through
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
five in this category
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
um and especially three and four so the
 
01:35:42.129 --> 01:35:42.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.139 --> 01:35:43.850 align:start position:0%
 
those

01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
those seem seemed very important right
 
01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.649 align:start position:0%
those seem seemed very important right
because

01:35:48.649 --> 01:35:48.659 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:35:50.290 --> 01:35:50.300 align:start position:0%
um they're they're starting
 
01:35:54.169 --> 01:35:54.179 align:start position:0%
they're completely redoing their
 
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
um system and this these two uh
 
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
positions lets them
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
hire fewer Consultants right so so if we
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't put these in they're going to be
 
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
spending on Consultants who are even
 
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
more expensive
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
from the from the uh this next-gen
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
company whereas putting in these two
 
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:17.699 align:start position:0%
positions lets them take over from the
 
01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
Consultants quicker so to me that these
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
are three and four are smart and if
 
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
three and four are good well then one
 
01:36:27.709 --> 01:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
and two presumably these are about
 
01:36:30.610 --> 01:36:30.620 align:start position:0%
privacy right I mean that's an important
 
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
aspect of
 
01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:33.770 align:start position:0%
aspect of
um

01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
I.T right so I I think
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
and then number five if I remember right
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
is a similar thing as the liquor ones
 
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
right with it they're
 
01:36:49.729 --> 01:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
um they again remember that this is the
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
one where they're spending four hundred
 
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour or something to get
 
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
support and if they can do the support
 
01:36:58.129 --> 01:36:58.139 align:start position:0%
in-house it's going to be much cheaper
 
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
so so we so I like one through five I
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
guess so we all could one through five
 
01:37:05.689 --> 01:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
so I have a question
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
where's the other side of these numbers
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
are they already in the budget or we
 
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
have to add them to the budget or
 
01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
they're they're all in the budget
 
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
somewhere else like the one we had Board
 
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
of tax and land appeals where they had
 
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
the nineteen thousand General going to
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
doit so somewhere probably in here
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a reference to the
 
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
board of tax and land appeals so these
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
are in the budget somewhere else and the
 
01:37:34.729 --> 01:37:34.739 align:start position:0%
next one you'll see is safety I don't
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
think we should act on that until we
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
know what division two is done but
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
they're elsewhere in the budget is a
 
01:37:40.679 --> 01:37:41.390 align:start position:0%
they're elsewhere in the budget is a
spent

01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
so it could be general for instance the
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration I
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
would assume that's General funds
 
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
because that's where they get them
 
01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.970 align:start position:0%
because that's where they get them
already

01:37:51.970 --> 01:37:51.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
because it's the department of
 
01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.169 align:start position:0%
because it's the department of
it's

01:37:56.169 --> 01:37:56.179 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
d-o-i-t-o-i-t so they're getting it from
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
some other they're getting it from
 
01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
revenue so if we go into this book
 
01:38:04.729 --> 01:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
they're somewhere there is that right Mr
 
01:38:04.739 --> 01:38:06.350 align:start position:0%
they're somewhere there is that right Mr
Hoffman

01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
Hoffman
 
01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
just to clarify if you approve these
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
we would add them in doat's budget and
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
we go to the sending agency and add them
 
01:38:15.659 --> 01:38:16.729 align:start position:0%
we go to the sending agency and add them
there

01:38:16.729 --> 01:38:16.739 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:38:16.739 --> 01:38:20.530 align:start position:0%
there
yeah

01:38:20.530 --> 01:38:20.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
the liquor Position will be a charge to
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
liquor fund but show up in this doat
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
budget as other funds yeah
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
so liquor is all liquor but the
 
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue is all General so
 
01:38:37.129 --> 01:38:37.139 align:start position:0%
somewhere there'd be a line for General
 
01:38:39.410 --> 01:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
to support this yeah so we we're
 
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
actually increasing so we're going to
 
01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
well seven was another rims related
 
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.149 align:start position:0%
well seven was another rims related
position

01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
all right representative McGuire you
 
01:38:57.649 --> 01:38:57.659 align:start position:0%
want to yeah so but but we're giving
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
them part part there I guess right
 
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:02.629 align:start position:0%
them part part there I guess right
yeah

01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
new position to support the next phase
 
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
so again it's
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
so it's very clear if we approve this
 
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
it's got to be paid for
 
01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:16.860 align:start position:0%
by probably in this particular case
 
01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
General funds because it's coming out of
 
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.649 align:start position:0%
General funds because it's coming out of
Revenue

01:39:21.649 --> 01:39:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
except for three and four which is
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
liquor which are liquor funds
 
01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.410 align:start position:0%
liquor which are liquor funds
hopefully

01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
well it says on each one right number
 
01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:31.139 align:start position:0%
one and number two are forty percent
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
General funds yeah
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
one through five
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
so okay so just going back though the
 
01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
hb2 request number one there I don't
 
01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
mean the money one I mean the doit thing
 
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
we didn't actually decide on this right
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
I thought we had but I'm not sure I
 
01:39:58.729 --> 01:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
thought I remember we talked about it in
 
01:40:00.530 --> 01:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
negative terms but I don't know whether
 
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
we actually decided on it that's the one
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
without their priority on the top it
 
01:40:08.209 --> 01:40:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
the information Technology Council any
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
I I have I have thoughts
 
01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm on the I'm on the I.T Council and
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
I know that the commissioner
 
01:40:23.689 --> 01:40:23.699 align:start position:0%
wants more legislative representation
 
01:40:26.209 --> 01:40:26.219 align:start position:0%
but on the other side of that I know
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
that the speaker is really concerned
 
01:40:31.129 --> 01:40:31.139 align:start position:0%
about the ballooning of of these
 
01:40:34.090 --> 01:40:34.100 align:start position:0%
commissions and increasing legislative
 
01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh time commitments that they can't
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
fulfill so I personally
 
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
um would not recommend this I think it
 
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
all right so you're suggesting leaving
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
it as two Representatives
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
any more thoughts on that we okay with
 
01:40:59.090 --> 01:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
that okay so we're we will not support
 
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
s

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:05.450 align:start position:0%
s
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:06.970 align:start position:0%
s
[Laughter]

01:41:06.970 --> 01:41:06.980 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
the one without a priority one without a
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
much question
 
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
I just have a question so for the
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
positions one and two it says 40 General
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
funds so would it be forty percent of
 
01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
that number or is that the or is that
 
01:41:34.689 --> 01:41:34.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:38.219 align:start position:0%
those two positions they charge all
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
other state agencies so it's allocated
 
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
and what we probably do to implement
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
that is put together a uh section in
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and get the funding detail
 
01:41:55.010 --> 01:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so that would make me
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
inclined to say yes on those two if it's
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
only 40 from General yep
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
okay and again we'll get a sheet similar
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
to this represent a camera as it will
 
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
look just like this and it'll have all
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
the numbers like the corresponding
 
01:42:11.639 --> 01:42:13.010 align:start position:0%
the numbers like the corresponding
transfers

01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
and it's why they'd hope we have
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
everything done by tomorrow so they can
 
01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
work the rest of the week and have
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
everything prepared for next week for us
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
so skipping down I guess to seven
 
01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:31.139 align:start position:0%
again that's all General funds that we
 
01:42:34.570 --> 01:42:34.580 align:start position:0%
were okay with that I think
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
eight priority eight is Department of
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
Safety we should probably wait to hear
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
from division two
 
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
nine is uh division two that's Fish and
 
01:42:43.739 --> 01:42:46.010 align:start position:0%
nine is uh division two that's Fish and
Game

01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
then we have the
 
01:42:50.810 --> 01:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative service and
 
01:42:53.570 --> 01:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr K I mean Mr Hoffman can you
 
01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:03.649 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr K I mean Mr Hoffman can you
recall

01:43:03.649 --> 01:43:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
this particular request
 
01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
we're at the bottom of page two is that
 
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
what's your
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
num it's marked as priority 11 whether I
 
01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:14.270 align:start position:0%
num it's marked as priority 11 whether I
guess

01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
oh priority 11. I'm just like that would
 
01:43:18.169 --> 01:43:18.179 align:start position:0%
be a shared
 
01:43:18.179 --> 01:43:18.770 align:start position:0%
be a shared
um

01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:20.090 align:start position:0%
um
person

01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
that would be probably General funds
 
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
because of those two apartments are
 
01:43:28.729 --> 01:43:28.739 align:start position:0%
mostly mostly General funds but it would
 
01:43:31.129 --> 01:43:31.139 align:start position:0%
one person will be shared for I.T
 
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
support between administrative services
 
01:43:35.930 --> 01:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
and justice
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
thoughts again both of those agencies
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
are primarily funded with General funds
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
so that would be a general fund impact
 
01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
I tend to think we should skip these
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
lower priority things especially because
 
01:43:51.609 --> 01:43:51.619 align:start position:0%
you know it has trouble enough hiring
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
you know you you dump us a huge number
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
of positions on them they already have
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
open positions
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't seem to gain much
 
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
sounds fair we okay with that
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
so 11 priority marked 11 that will be
 
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
off Melissa and like then we go jump
 
01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:13.139 align:start position:0%
down to uh
 
01:44:13.139 --> 01:44:16.070 align:start position:0%
down to uh
liquor

01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
again these would be all liquor funds
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
most likely and that's not guaranteed
 
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
because sometimes the liquor does get
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
General funds it's not a lot but
 
01:44:28.129 --> 01:44:28.139 align:start position:0%
any issues with
 
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
both those two items uh Liquor
 
01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.030 align:start position:0%
both those two items uh Liquor
Commission

01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously they're needed but I I
 
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
would have liked to seen the note on
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
there that says that it would be liquor
 
01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
functions yeah because that makes the
 
01:44:42.010 --> 01:44:42.020 align:start position:0%
most sense and they're self you know
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
self uh funded so yes these will both be
 
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
liquor funds
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
then the next three with the Department
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
of Information Technology on page three
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
those are liquor
 
01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
uh commission again Mr Hoffman or
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
Melissa are we pretty confident those
 
01:45:10.129 --> 01:45:10.139 align:start position:0%
are all liquor funds yes okay so we okay
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
judicial Council
 
01:45:18.169 --> 01:45:18.179 align:start position:0%
as you probably that's uh there's no
 
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
priority there but four million dollars
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
as you know that the judicial Council
 
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
can come to
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal for additional help if necessary
 
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
probably a terrible thing to do but
 
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in the budget we don't
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
completely fund this we because we know
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
they can go to physical but Mr Hoffman
 
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
or Melissa any comments
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
they had a proposal in their agency
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
request to the governor for a secondary
 
01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
public defender program
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
and that was not included in the
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
governor's budget so they described it
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
when they were in for their presentation
 
01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
okay representative Sweeney
 
01:46:01.609 --> 01:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
thank you for sure I would just say with
 
01:46:05.209 --> 01:46:05.219 align:start position:0%
their unique ability to go to fiscal to
 
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
get the funding if needed I I would be
 
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to put this in the
 
01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.290 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to put this in the
budget

01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
is my field four million in general
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
funds is a is a big price tag when not
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
all the other agencies have the same
 
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so when the judicial Council
 
01:46:29.209 --> 01:46:29.219 align:start position:0%
goes to fiscal do they get the money
 
01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
they need
 
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
just the ability to go doesn't I don't
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
think in life
 
01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
several terms they've ever been denied
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
but they do have to make a request that
 
01:46:41.450 --> 01:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
has to be approved and this is generally
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
for outside counsel and
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weiler nice to see
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
you sir see you since they don't know at
 
01:46:53.090 --> 01:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
the beginning of how many cases they're
 
01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
going to have and they hire the lawyers
 
01:46:58.609 --> 01:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
as needed so they they start out with
 
01:47:00.770 --> 01:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
very little money in their budget then
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
they come to fiscal on a regular basis
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
it's not a not a lot of money that we
 
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
don't have something to spare but the
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
idea is they they really start off with
 
01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
a big big amount of money and then they
 
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal after they see what the
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
number of cases they'll have to deal
 
01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.850 align:start position:0%
number of cases they'll have to deal
with

01:47:18.850 --> 01:47:18.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah as I recall there's
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
already something like a 10 million
 
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
dollar increase from the previous
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
biennium in this particular area it's
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
substantial it's very substantial but
 
01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
the one thing you know now that we're
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
talking about this particular budget
 
01:47:36.770 --> 01:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
they had kind of three categories of
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys there was the kind that are
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
employees there's the kind that are have
 
01:47:46.129 --> 01:47:46.139 align:start position:0%
contracts and then there's the kind that
 
01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
are hired
 
01:47:51.169 --> 01:47:51.179 align:start position:0%
just on a for a particular case right
 
01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to me that the contract
 
01:47:57.290 --> 01:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
ones were the most cost effective and
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
and if it was me I would but they're
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
having trouble finding them because
 
01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
their cost effective right and so I
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
would move money into the contract area
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
maybe from the the one-time area and and
 
01:48:14.209 --> 01:48:14.219 align:start position:0%
have them raise rates that they offer
 
01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
for contracts to maybe attract more
 
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
people into the contract area so that
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
was how I was gonna propose we changed
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
that particular area of the budget move
 
01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
some into the contract area but you know
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's time or whatever
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
to do that and as representative
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
Wireless said they can come to fiscal
 
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
should they get in a jam
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
not that that's great budgeting but
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.139 --> 01:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.709 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
so we'll remove the four million dollars
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
from that request
 
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
so we had a presentation by the
 
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and I recalled was
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
wasn't there something other than the
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
witness specialist program position
 
01:49:04.129 --> 01:49:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
Easter they had two requests one for the
 
01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
witness Specialists and then a
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
transportation attorney that would be
 
01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
funded by do
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
T I almost said I thought there was
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
something else but anyway
 
01:49:22.209 --> 01:49:22.219 align:start position:0%
all right thoughts on those two items
 
01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative evil no I was just going
 
01:49:28.010 --> 01:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
to say on the victim I think it it was
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
the elderly who were the victim victims
 
01:49:33.169 --> 01:49:33.179 align:start position:0%
yeah they said that there had they had
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
seen a great increase in the scamming
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
attempts on the elderly and they really
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
thought that they needed more help with
 
01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:44.810 align:start position:0%
thought that they needed more help with
that

01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.310 align:start position:0%
that
okay

01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
to me it seems like a reasonable request
 
01:49:50.209 --> 01:49:50.219 align:start position:0%
especially since they identify the
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
problem with the elderly
 
01:49:57.649 --> 01:49:57.659 align:start position:0%
being taken advantage of thoughts
 
01:50:00.290 --> 01:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
okay with checking those both of those
 
01:50:02.810 --> 01:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
off Transportation dot which would
 
01:50:04.250 --> 01:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
probably be
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
federal funds dot as far as that
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
line of funding Highway funds
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
then we move down to liquor that there's
 
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
no particular priority
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
it's all other is that all liquor funds
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
it should be Mr Hoffman Melissa
 
01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
yes that'll be liquor funds
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
Annie represent Maguire so these are the
 
01:50:30.530 --> 01:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
matching ones for the previous numbers
 
01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
you see how the numbers are the same
 
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
for the other thing is that we so we
 
01:50:38.930 --> 01:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
sort of already approved these yeah oh
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll check off all those
 
01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
oh this could be a good place the next
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
one office of professional licensure
 
01:51:01.129 --> 01:51:01.139 align:start position:0%
we could jump to your Amendment
 
01:51:02.810 --> 01:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative of wire and close
 
01:51:05.689 --> 01:51:05.699 align:start position:0%
something out on a good note
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
you want to offer that now as as far as
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
oplc yeah well notice that these are
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
savings right so yeah so they certainly
 
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
seem like a good idea
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
well I don't know if if we don't go with
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
all those sections whether this actually
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
they had some positions in the hospital
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
one that were previously full-time
 
01:51:34.609 --> 01:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
temporary positions that were converted
 
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
to full time
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
so they had the funds budget in two
 
01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:40.550 align:start position:0%
so they had the funds budget in two
places

01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
places
 
01:51:44.570 --> 01:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
in case the full-time conversions were
 
01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
not approved when they came in they
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
identified this and said if we
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
if we're successful getting full-time
 
01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
positions we can reduce this money from
 
01:51:56.570 --> 01:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
01:51:58.490 --> 01:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
you know whether like six or something
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
yeah five or six five or six yeah
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
all right so is that okay yeah it's okay
 
01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
but it notice it's all other because
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
they're now off budgets right right yeah
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
so I guess we can say
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
okay for that but just because we're
 
01:52:16.729 --> 01:52:16.739 align:start position:0%
like near that office of professional
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
licensure I thought you'd like to maybe
 
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
jump with but I mean we're all we're
 
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
going to talk about this
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:33.649 --> 01:52:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:35.689 --> 01:52:35.699 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of discussion on that Rim
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's not sure again well this is again
 
01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
yeah these are matching yeah these are
 
01:52:42.050 --> 01:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
magically so we're good with those
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
or just do whatever a lot of money
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
the last row is the Consultants you know
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't think you've acted on that
 
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
what's that the last one the last row on
 
01:52:59.090 --> 01:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
page three
 
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
yeah we didn't talk
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's expensive
 
01:53:16.609 --> 01:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
yeah it's all
 
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
it's all General funds
 
01:53:23.570 --> 01:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
we give them one give them one yeah for
 
01:53:26.689 --> 01:53:26.699 align:start position:0%
the consultant yeah
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
one additional consultant Melissa Mike
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
so however that breaks down that eight
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand and one point three
 
01:53:36.119 --> 01:53:37.189 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand and one point three
million

01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
and again that's General funds that's a
 
01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:40.729 align:start position:0%
and again that's General funds that's a
significant

01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:53:40.739 --> 01:53:43.669 align:start position:0%
significant
ask

01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:46.570 --> 01:53:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:49.129 --> 01:53:49.139 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt that that wouldn't
 
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh have anything to do with the rims
 
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
that we improved the equipment
 
01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:56.209 align:start position:0%
that we improved the equipment
what

01:53:56.209 --> 01:53:56.219 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it would
 
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
it's a maintenance
 
01:54:04.609 --> 01:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
I believe represented I mean I'm sorry
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
we'd have to go back and look at their
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh presentation but I believe the
 
01:54:21.050 --> 01:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner said that uh they use these
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
Consultants with the rim system and they
 
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
hope to
 
01:54:28.609 --> 01:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
bring their own staff up to speed but
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
they need them for
 
01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
in in the interim period
 
01:54:35.629 --> 01:54:35.639 align:start position:0%
seems to be coming back yeah I mean
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's my recollection as well they
 
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
really wanted to get their own people
 
01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime they had to use the
 
01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:45.609 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime they had to use the
Consultants

01:54:45.609 --> 01:54:45.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
very expensive hopefully the one
 
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
consultant can help bring the people up
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
to where they should be
 
01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:56.030 align:start position:0%
to where they should be
hmm

01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner you're still here what are
 
01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
oh well tomorrow represent Maguire when
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
I guess would like to hold his Amendment
 
01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
until tomorrow I think very likely
 
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
um no change no it'll come out of the
 
01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:15.229 align:start position:0%
um no change no it'll come out of the
budget

01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
the foresterlights if that's what you're
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
so you got everybody on edge now so I
 
01:55:25.609 --> 01:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
might as well go break the news you know
 
01:55:25.619 --> 01:55:26.750 align:start position:0%
might as well go break the news you know
so

01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
the division will be looking at an
 
01:55:30.530 --> 01:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
amendment that's offered by
 
01:55:32.689 --> 01:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you know
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
apparently a lot of you are sitting here
 
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
waiting for no
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
all sections will be removed
 
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
and then the division will go back and
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
look at an amendment that was offered on
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
Friday for 6.55
 
01:55:51.290 --> 01:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
and include that perhaps but I think
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
that was yeah pretty much the unanimous
 
01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:54.890 align:start position:0%
that was yeah pretty much the unanimous
foot

01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
foot
 
01:55:57.709 --> 01:55:57.719 align:start position:0%
um as far as the Edna committee and
 
01:55:59.330 --> 01:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
those of us listening
 
01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
but then we're going to go back and look
 
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
at some of the others there were
 
01:56:04.189 --> 01:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations by the Secretary of
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
State's office to move three I believe
 
01:56:08.930 --> 01:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
agencies there
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple others like Hawker
 
01:56:13.070 --> 01:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
and Peddlers I think representative
 
01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
cabrals was interested in seeing that
 
01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:16.550 align:start position:0%
cabrals was interested in seeing that
removed

01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
removed
 
01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
all right as far as a requirement but
 
01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
all the others that have generated a
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
great deal of angst
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
will probably be left out but that's not
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
to say that someone may want to see
 
01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
something brought in but I think
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and you know
 
01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
worked very hard over the weekend with
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
the chair of the committee or the chair
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
of the Edna committee yeah and we spoke
 
01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
and I think some good suggestions coming
 
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
on it we've listened to you know the
 
01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
folks that have reached out to us and
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
I'm so when we're not gonna
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.330 --> 01:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm gonna change that yeah that I
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
think that remains out but again I I'm
 
01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
not going to speak the division is going
 
01:57:20.209 --> 01:57:20.219 align:start position:0%
to discuss this but just to let you know
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're taking everything out we're going
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at the specific
 
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
pieces but where there's no controversy
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
I think will be okay but we've heard
 
01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
from you know hundreds of people over
 
01:57:36.129 --> 01:57:36.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
pardon yeah it'll be yeah it'll be
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
pretty small it will you know be very
 
01:57:48.290 --> 01:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
small it changes that we put it back the
 
01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
things we put back it'll it'll be a
 
01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's 20 of the pages or something
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
so the division heard loud and clear
 
01:58:00.169 --> 01:58:00.179 align:start position:0%
that there were some concerns we I think
 
01:58:02.810 --> 01:58:02.820 align:start position:0%
I can say all of us agree that there
 
01:58:04.729 --> 01:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
needs to be more participation by those
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
affected before it moves forward
 
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
so but thanks for hanging around I guess
 
01:58:11.209 --> 01:58:11.219 align:start position:0%
now you
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh I was a concern when I saw the
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
Timberland owner there sitting back
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
there what trouble we were in again but
 
01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I I know he carries a
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
big ax
 
01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:24.770 align:start position:0%
big ax
thanks

01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
all right one more time so I want to
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
thank representative McGuire for all his
 
01:58:32.689 --> 01:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
work and over the weekend and yes thank
 
01:58:34.850 --> 01:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
you so much done a lot of listening and
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
 
01:58:40.729 --> 01:58:40.739 align:start position:0%
so going to the last page page four the
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:58:49.209 --> 01:58:49.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
what's the condition of the ones you're
 
01:58:53.229 --> 01:58:53.239 align:start position:0%
driving now
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
you're aging I'm not sure how old they
 
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
are but they're aging yeah
 
01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean again the government they
 
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
did make a
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
it didn't like as representative McGuire
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
just said the governor didn't include it
 
01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
in his budget but the commissioner
 
01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
didn't make a case that
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
um maybe we can cut it down a little
 
01:59:10.679 --> 01:59:11.810 align:start position:0%
um maybe we can cut it down a little
better

01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I would say we all try to
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
hold on to our vehicles 15 to 20 years
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
now so I don't know how old theirs are
 
01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:21.530 align:start position:0%
now so I don't know how old theirs are
but

01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
so we looked maybe 75
 
01:59:26.649 --> 01:59:26.659 align:start position:0%
000 or if it was it
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine with that yeah as long as
 
01:59:31.490 --> 01:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
they don't buy EVS I'd only buy them one
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
01:59:35.689 --> 01:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
classic cars they could probably
 
01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
probably buy two with that but that's a
 
01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:38.750 align:start position:0%
probably buy two with that but that's a
start

01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh temporary staffing 20 000 we heard
 
01:59:57.169 --> 01:59:57.179 align:start position:0%
like Commissioners say that during the
 
01:59:58.970 --> 01:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
busy season they really need people to
 
02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
open envelopes and that sort of thing so
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
how about for fiscal year 24 only
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
because when we get rid of the interest
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
and dividends taxes there'll be much
 
02:00:12.050 --> 02:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
fewer envelopes
 
02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:15.109 align:start position:0%
fewer envelopes
yes

02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
you're as tight
 
02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:18.050 align:start position:0%
you're as tight
[Laughter]

02:00:18.050 --> 02:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:00:25.010 --> 02:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
I've often said to representative
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
Maguire's as tight as bark on a tree so
 
02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:32.209 align:start position:0%
Maguire's as tight as bark on a tree so
anyway

02:00:32.209 --> 02:00:32.219 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay so are we okay with the 20 000
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative of life okay
 
02:00:41.570 --> 02:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
I think we have to do the next one
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
so treasury doit funds of
 
02:00:50.089 --> 02:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so that's okay yeah it was
 
02:00:54.649 --> 02:00:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
and then was this next one just a
 
02:01:00.050 --> 02:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:01.930 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:01:01.930 --> 02:01:01.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:01:05.209 --> 02:01:05.219 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman Treasurer came in and asked
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
for this debt service line to be moved
 
02:01:11.810 --> 02:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
to Department of Revenue and uh
 
02:01:13.729 --> 02:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
the Commission of Revenue came in and
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
said they don't agree with it but after
 
02:01:19.250 --> 02:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
that they have had a meeting and they
 
02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:22.679 align:start position:0%
agreed with the move as long as they can
 
02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.139 align:start position:0%
have the um
 
02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'll spill two language listed here
 
02:01:28.199 --> 02:01:31.550 align:start position:0%
I'll spill two language listed here
added

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.570 --> 02:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
so it being 11 30 I'll run over and see
 
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
if Janet's got the list ready for the
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
exact session and we can talk about that
 
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
and we should realize that we just spent
 
02:01:54.850 --> 02:01:54.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
three million yeah six maybe between the
 
02:02:02.209 --> 02:02:02.219 align:start position:0%
two years right you know so it's got to
 
02:02:04.370 --> 02:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
come from somewhere
 
02:02:07.810 --> 02:02:07.820 align:start position:0%
so we won't repeal either
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
taxes that proposal adds money it
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
oh okay good all right
 
02:02:41.089 --> 02:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so but do we have to um
 
02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 250
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 250 has to be exact this
 
02:02:51.709 --> 02:02:51.719 align:start position:0%
afternoon so I think we should talk
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
about it now since we sort of left it
 
02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:57.470 align:start position:0%
about it now since we sort of left it
hanging

02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
full Finance so but we should give them
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
like Finance was the division one show
 
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
yeah right it is yeah
 
02:03:17.209 --> 02:03:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.410 --> 02:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:22.729 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:03:22.729 --> 02:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:03:22.739 --> 02:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
good
yeah

02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 250 if you recall this is
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
the one about accidental death benefits
 
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
and when we looked into it we discovered
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
that so this was to raise it from 50 to
 
02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
100 percent
 
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
but and only for group twos originally
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
and but what we discovered is of the 19
 
02:03:52.189 --> 02:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
we'll just say widows who are getting
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
benefits right now
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
because of the way the calculation is
 
02:03:59.089 --> 02:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
done there are two of them that are
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
currently getting about 125 000 a year
 
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
so so if we change it to a hundred those
 
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
would have been 250 000. now now the
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
bill itself will not affect anyone
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
currently getting benefits right because
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
because the way the retirement system
 
02:04:20.089 --> 02:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
works as soon as your your benefits are
 
02:04:22.609 --> 02:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
set as soon as you retire that's it
 
02:04:26.089 --> 02:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
unless there are colas but but but
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
future changes in methods of calculating
 
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
only affect future people they don't
 
02:04:34.609 --> 02:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
affect past right so so
 
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
and then the second thing about the bill
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
was it seemed a little bit unfair to be
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
only group two when it's possible for
 
02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
group one people especially in D.O.T to
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be killed on the job right you know
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
so uh so so my proposal is as follows so
 
02:04:56.089 --> 02:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
um have it apply both to group one and
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.410 --> 02:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
um but put a cap
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
right of 85 000 on the total payment
 
02:05:10.729 --> 02:05:10.739 align:start position:0%
now the reason 85 000 I thought a
 
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand would be a reasonable
 
02:05:15.890 --> 02:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
cap and this money is not taxable
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
so so a hundred thousand
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
with taxes is something like 85 000
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
without taxes so so that's that
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
and the other change here though
 
02:05:31.450 --> 02:05:31.460 align:start position:0%
is no is that
 
02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
originally group two is earnable
 
02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:36.950 align:start position:0%
originally group two is earnable
compensation

02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
and not average final compensation
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
there's a weird difference between what
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
group ones our average final
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
compensation and group twos are earnable
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
compensation and and it seemed like
 
02:05:52.850 --> 02:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
average final compensation is the right
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
thing to use because that will
 
02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.310 align:start position:0%
thing to use because that will
that

02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:00.890 --> 02:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
it makes it more like regular salary
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
sort of and a little less like
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
um something
 
02:06:08.209 --> 02:06:08.219 align:start position:0%
out of bounds
 
02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay so the the average final
 
02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
compensation means that five-year
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
average of your five highest uh years
 
02:06:18.649 --> 02:06:18.659 align:start position:0%
rather than exactly what you got this
 
02:06:22.370 --> 02:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
last year sort of thing so so I think
 
02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
this is a very reasonable
 
02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:25.729 align:start position:0%
this is a very reasonable
um

02:06:25.729 --> 02:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment it does do the basics which
 
02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
is change fifty percent to a hundred
 
02:06:35.089 --> 02:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
percent but it but it has some caps and
 
02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
it has some you know other thing to make
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
it make it more reasonable so
 
02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:47.570 align:start position:0%
it make it more reasonable so
that's

02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
what oh and and so I would move
 
02:06:52.970 --> 02:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I guess ought to pass with Amendment
 
02:06:56.330 --> 02:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
on this because this this doesn't affect
 
02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
the current budget
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
unless in case you know someone someone
 
02:07:03.410 --> 02:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
is killed during this season you know
 
02:07:05.810 --> 02:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
they it would affect them but but it but
 
02:07:07.609 --> 02:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
02:07:10.129 --> 02:07:10.139 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note in that that
 
02:07:10.139 --> 02:07:13.790 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note in that that
sense

02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.649 --> 02:07:15.659 align:start position:0%
I I would just say as the as the member
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
that was going to move to retain 250
 
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
this afternoon I'm happy to pass it on
 
02:07:23.209 --> 02:07:23.219 align:start position:0%
to you to amend it
 
02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
oh I would suck in the motion to adopt
 
02:07:34.129 --> 02:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:36.290 --> 02:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
yes all right show of hands on the
 
02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:38.089 align:start position:0%
yes all right show of hands on the
amendment

02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:07:43.129 --> 02:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
yeah but I wasn't here so oh okay so I
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
guess uh seven to zero and then ought to
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment the clerk want to
 
02:07:55.850 --> 02:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:56.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:07:56.930 --> 02:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:56.940 --> 02:07:58.550 align:start position:0%
okay
otpa

02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
02:08:01.129 --> 02:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
um moved so I'm gonna have it moved by
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
McGuire could somebody second his okay
 
02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:08.930 align:start position:0%
McGuire could somebody second his okay
cambrose

02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
okay representative McGuire
 
02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative Griffin
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative Sweeney yes
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative camberells yes
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
um representative grassy yes
 
02:08:26.570 --> 02:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt yes
 
02:08:29.930 --> 02:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes chair Leachman and I
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't here so okay so you'll okay okay
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
so one two three four five
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
five seven seven zero
 
02:08:37.679 --> 02:08:39.229 align:start position:0%
five seven seven zero
unanimous

02:08:39.229 --> 02:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
unanimous
 
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:43.920 --> 02:10:00.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:02.930 align:start position:0%
 
74.

02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
74.
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
the ambrell's moved itl five to three
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
that looks correct
 
02:10:13.550 --> 02:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
um I had an idea about this one actually
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
um this one and 234
 
02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:18.470 align:start position:0%
um this one and 234
so

02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
234 I guess we could for neither one of
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
these had a fiscal note right neither
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
one really we decided that there's
 
02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:27.709 align:start position:0%
one really we decided that there's
anything

02:10:27.709 --> 02:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:10:30.050 --> 02:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
about Finance here it's just a matter of
 
02:10:31.970 --> 02:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
sending it back and having another vote
 
02:10:34.609 --> 02:10:34.619 align:start position:0%
on it right yeah and
 
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
um so I was thinking we should send them
 
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
back without recommendation
 
02:10:41.089 --> 02:10:41.099 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:10:44.089 --> 02:10:44.099 align:start position:0%
with some like this one it's itl just
 
02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
because five of us don't like it and
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
three of us do right but but we could
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
actually send it back to the floor
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
without recommendation and the way we
 
02:10:56.209 --> 02:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
can do that is in the big room if we
 
02:10:59.450 --> 02:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
propose itl and vote it down and we
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
propose OTP and vote it down then
 
02:11:04.729 --> 02:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
there's no recommendation right so
 
02:11:06.649 --> 02:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'm thinking is right
 
02:11:12.169 --> 02:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
with 74 and 234. I I would agree with
 
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
that I mean having written the committee
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
report for 234 the bottom line was there
 
02:11:21.410 --> 02:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
was no fiscal effect and um you know I
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
don't see why we can't go in you just
 
02:11:25.070 --> 02:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
say there's no recommendation and that
 
02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
the because that maybe supports us but
 
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's not a vote you can't vote on no
 
02:11:35.149 --> 02:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:39.250 --> 02:11:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we can make a
 
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
OTP itl and just say I recommend you
 
02:11:48.050 --> 02:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
vote no on this you know it sounds like
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
can you change that since we've already
 
02:11:53.689 --> 02:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
taken a vote can you no can you just
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
take yeah I will make or you will make
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
because it could go to the floor and say
 
02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
that the financing like in your report
 
02:12:05.570 --> 02:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
is no Financial impact and
 
02:12:07.609 --> 02:12:07.619 align:start position:0%
Let It Go with that but to have like two
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
votes like and then hope it's a we can't
 
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
really have a tie because we've got 25
 
02:12:16.669 --> 02:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
but they could be IDL loses and OTP
 
02:12:16.679 --> 02:12:19.790 align:start position:0%
but they could be IDL loses and OTP
moves

02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
exactly it just looks kind of
 
02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
yes right well my opinion is that yeah
 
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
granted they didn't have fiscal notes
 
02:12:31.129 --> 02:12:31.139 align:start position:0%
but they came here we took the time on
 
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
this and we took the time to to take a
 
02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
vote on it and if sometimes they stick
 
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
us for policy issues we're still a
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I believe it's our job
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
to make recommendations where where at
 
02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
all possible so I agree with
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell say because we
 
02:12:50.209 --> 02:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
did discuss it and
 
02:12:50.219 --> 02:12:51.589 align:start position:0%
did discuss it and
in

02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
I represented Campbell's blur but I
 
02:12:56.290 --> 02:12:56.300 align:start position:0%
think it was pretty clear on
 
02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:58.010 align:start position:0%
think it was pretty clear on
74.

02:12:58.010 --> 02:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
74.
 
02:12:58.020 --> 02:12:59.270 align:start position:0%
74.
but

02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
I just think it makes it kind of
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
complicated to go out and have a vote
 
02:13:04.189 --> 02:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
everybody votes no and then everyone
 
02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
votes yes and we can say in the blurb
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
there was no Financial impact like you
 
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
both said
 
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
on General funding finances
 
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
I just don't want to complicate things
 
02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:19.250 align:start position:0%
I just don't want to complicate things
think

02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:13:25.370 --> 02:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
so in 212 it's a e-fas
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
were you gonna have something well yeah
 
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
we we do
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
we remember I forwarded to you uh rep
 
02:13:36.649 --> 02:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
yes we have a house bill 2 Amendment
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
right with that and it uh do we have it
 
02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
back took the cost out and used it right
 
02:13:44.330 --> 02:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
I can explain it we don't have the text
 
02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I have the text I didn't know if
 
02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
you wanted to get that out or just work
 
02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
on these bills because that's really a
 
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
houseboat too yeah so this is a retain
 
02:13:54.050 --> 02:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a house bill too I can
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
here money the request request was two
 
02:14:03.890 --> 02:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
million dollars what
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
um what the amendment is is that they uh
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
they just say that up to ten percent of
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
the fund can be used for investigation
 
02:14:18.109 --> 02:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
and and there were textural changes to
 
02:14:20.089 --> 02:14:20.099 align:start position:0%
the use of the fund
 
02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
so they did what we asked them I mean
 
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
what we discussed
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
all right so um
 
02:14:29.930 --> 02:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
2 30 we actually kind of went over that
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
a little while ago as far as the money
 
02:14:38.050 --> 02:14:38.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:40.669 --> 02:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
234 this is where your no recommendation
 
02:14:43.069 --> 02:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
will come in representative McGuire
 
02:14:46.729 --> 02:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
right but we have an odd number so oh I
 
02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
know so the only way to have no
 
02:14:51.050 --> 02:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
recommendation is if somebody said for
 
02:14:54.050 --> 02:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
everybody to vote no on everything yeah
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
exactly so that's what I plan to do
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
all right well so 250 while I was out
 
02:15:02.810 --> 02:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
you took that up and that you'll speak
 
02:15:05.209 --> 02:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
to that representative McGuire yes and
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
the vote was six to zero seven
 
02:15:11.330 --> 02:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
oh that's right Wyler was here right
 
02:15:17.089 --> 02:15:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:21.530 --> 02:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:26.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:15:26.330 --> 02:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
but he didn't wait I'm just our chair
 
02:15:32.930 --> 02:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
didn't well I didn't vote yeah three
 
02:15:36.890 --> 02:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
yeah seven zero seven is seven right you
 
02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:37.940 align:start position:0%
do good
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
he's a numbers guy
 
02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:43.129 align:start position:0%
he's a numbers guy
yeah

02:15:43.129 --> 02:15:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
so uh the next one is division two
 
02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:48.890 align:start position:0%
so uh the next one is division two
um

02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
02:15:54.129 --> 02:15:54.139 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria yeah
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
because we need to study that's a real
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.930 --> 02:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
food away sets going into the budget
 
02:16:07.550 --> 02:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
right representative in that vote
 
02:16:10.930 --> 02:16:10.940 align:start position:0%
apparently was unanimous there
 
02:16:13.609 --> 02:16:13.619 align:start position:0%
seven zero
 
02:16:16.970 --> 02:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
two six one Well Carrie recalls it was
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
unanimous but if I did a triple back
 
02:16:22.729 --> 02:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:25.729 --> 02:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
National Guard recruiting are you rep
 
02:16:27.890 --> 02:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
represent why are you all set with this
 
02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:31.010 align:start position:0%
represent why are you all set with this
okay

02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:40.509 --> 02:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:40.519 --> 02:16:42.169 align:start position:0%
 
337.

02:16:42.169 --> 02:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
337.
 
02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
that was just like a notice oh yeah
 
02:16:47.330 --> 02:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
notice of hearings yeah it was a minor
 
02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
thing yeah so you're all set with that
 
02:16:51.169 --> 02:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I think I still
 
02:16:54.589 --> 02:16:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.049 --> 02:16:57.059 align:start position:0%
nothing he's he's actually got them all
 
02:16:59.330 --> 02:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
done he's really good about them I don't
 
02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
think I do I don't think you have this
 
02:17:02.810 --> 02:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
one though but anyway retain on the next
 
02:17:09.770 --> 02:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:13.330 --> 02:17:13.340 align:start position:0%
okay the tenants
 
02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
that was again unnoticed it was just a
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management this is in the
 
02:17:24.359 --> 02:17:26.570 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management this is in the
budget

02:17:26.570 --> 02:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:17:30.049 --> 02:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
representative evil you're good
 
02:17:33.290 --> 02:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
Adult Parole Board representative Hewitt
 
02:17:39.849 --> 02:17:39.859 align:start position:0%
you're all set with this speak
 
02:17:43.690 --> 02:17:43.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:47.330 --> 02:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh Chief Information officer that I
 
02:17:50.330 --> 02:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
think this was just Edward's Bill you'll
 
02:17:51.770 --> 02:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
I'll sit with this representative
 
02:17:54.589 --> 02:17:54.599 align:start position:0%
McGuire did this one did we put it in
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill too or not
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
you'll have to remind us Mr Hoffman it
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
sounds similar to the language in House
 
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
Bill too but this one had no cost and
 
02:18:06.290 --> 02:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
this just aligned with
 
02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:07.129 align:start position:0%
this just aligned with
um

02:18:07.129 --> 02:18:07.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
their current practices so it brings the
 
02:18:12.169 --> 02:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
definitions into align with what they
 
02:18:14.690 --> 02:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
have the one in the other one in
 
02:18:17.209 --> 02:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
hospital 2 is privacy so we've got
 
02:18:19.310 --> 02:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
security and privacy so we're not
 
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
affecting the same line two different
 
02:18:24.169 --> 02:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
things okay nice okay all right so this
 
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
is Scandal yeah this is very exciting
 
02:18:30.610 --> 02:18:30.620 align:start position:0%
this one uh represents McGuire this was
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
this was okay
 
02:18:33.479 --> 02:18:34.450 align:start position:0%
this was okay
um

02:18:34.450 --> 02:18:34.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney we've got you
 
02:18:38.330 --> 02:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
down the next one that was you worked
 
02:18:40.610 --> 02:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
with representative manager Puti and the
 
02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:48.359 --> 02:18:49.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
because Janet sent the notice for our
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
work session tomorrow did not make it in
 
02:18:57.889 --> 02:18:57.899 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
02:18:59.570 --> 02:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
I have to say that we're going to
 
02:19:03.129 --> 02:19:03.139 align:start position:0%
reconvene tomorrow at 9 30 right now so
 
02:19:06.530 --> 02:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
we are reconvening our work session for
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at 9 30 at which time will take
 
02:19:10.730 --> 02:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
up all the oplc
 
02:19:13.129 --> 02:19:13.139 align:start position:0%
and the retirement bills that we're
 
02:19:14.889 --> 02:19:14.899 align:start position:0%
still waiting for some information on
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
and other than that we're pretty close
 
02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:17.990 align:start position:0%
and other than that we're pretty close
to

02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:19:21.049 --> 02:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
done and appreciate everyone's efforts
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have all new sheets tomorrow
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
morning as well as far as everything
 
02:19:26.570 --> 02:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's been shaded out
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to
 
02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:31.139 align:start position:0%
again thank you all there's a lot going
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
on here
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
I think we've made some good progress
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
and again I would Echo what
 
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney said is trying to
 
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
get together on a couple of things which
 
02:19:45.049 --> 02:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.650 --> 02:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
all right so we're in full committee for
 
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
exec session and all these bills at one
 
02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:52.550 align:start position:0%
exec session and all these bills at one
o'clock

02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
02:20:01.130 --> 02:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
oh there we go so we get some more
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
information on that okay that's this one
 
02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
oh yeah this here we go now we gotta
 
02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:17.330 align:start position:0%
oh yeah this here we go now we gotta
read

02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
thanks Mike and Melissa for getting us
 
02:20:19.439 --> 02:20:28.010 align:start position:0%
thanks Mike and Melissa for getting us
this

02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand in the and the I mean
 
02:20:33.050 --> 02:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
we have more information here I mean PR
 
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have a great connotation
 
02:20:37.690 --> 02:20:37.700 align:start position:0%
in some ways but it really is like
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
sharing information about the about what
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
they do and trying to get the word out
 
02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
to affected people it's less expensive
 
02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
than case management so I mean I don't
 
02:20:48.660 --> 02:20:50.210 align:start position:0%
than case management so I mean I don't
know

02:20:50.210 --> 02:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:20:58.670 --> 02:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
so representative Sweeney thank you Mr I
 
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
would say the for it might not be their
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
top priority but for me I'd rather spend
