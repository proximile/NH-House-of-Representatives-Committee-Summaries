00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
for specified costs uh to be
 
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
administered as we understand through
 
00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor I and we've
 
00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit about some of the
 
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
rationale uh as to why um in part as I
 
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
understand because of the Department's
 
00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
um connection with with Workforce so I
 
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
do just want to take a moment to kind of
 
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
maybe explain a little bit about what
 
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor does primarily
 
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
do and we are called the Department of
 
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
Labor the majority of our uh role uh
 
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
really the sole role that the department
 
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
has is in the context of regulation of
 
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.589 align:start position:0%
has is in the context of regulation of
employers

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh and insurance carriers as it relates
 
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
to workers compensation the workers
 
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
compensation scheme uh for employers
 
00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
across the state uh and Employers in
 
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
certain compliance with uh primarily
 
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
wage W what we would call wage laws are
 
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
employees working are they getting paid
 
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
in time recordkeeping related to that is
 
00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 align:start position:0%
minimum wage being paid when appropriate
 
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
over time um those types of issues and
 
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
then also some occupational safety um
 
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
area so this this program would be
 
00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 align:start position:0%
somewhat different than the types of
 
00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
program uh really we don't have any
 
00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
programs this would be um a very
 
00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
different type of program uh to for the
 
00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
Department one that we we don't have
 
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
something similar to currently um we
 
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't administer any other types of
 
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
Grant programs we don't uh have grants
 
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
that funnel uh through our agency
 
00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
currently um kind of as some technical
 
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
points and just sort of looking at the
 
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
structure of the bill itself number one
 
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
were this language to go into effect we
 
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
would really recommend uh creating a
 
00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 align:start position:0%
whole new section um right now it's
 
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
placed within
 
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
27584 which is uh relative to protective
 
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
legislation outlining certain
 
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for employers as it relates
 
00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
to recordkeeping and and hours worked
 
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature this probably
 
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
would um more likely than not would uh
 
00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
be more appropriately placed perhaps as
 
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
a 275 DJ um as its own section separate
 
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
from protective legislation um in
 
00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
addition the department would note that
 
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
there is nothing uh within the proposed
 
00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
language giving it rule making Authority
 
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
and it would be our it is our
 
00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
understanding from the proposed language
 
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
that given that this grant program would
 
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
be funneling through the department we
 
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 align:start position:0%
would be having some form of oversight
 
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
in relation to it and we believe in
 
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
order to do that adequately we would
 
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
need the ability to make rules um as to
 
00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 align:start position:0%
the language itself that's been proposed
 
00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 align:start position:0%
a couple of um areas that we would note
 
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
um you know number one if we look at
 
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
provision two at line 13 it's uh having
 
00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 align:start position:0%
the department in consultation with the
 
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
advisory Council on Child Care um work
 
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
on designating an entity to uh
 
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
administer the Recruitment and Retention
 
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
of the grants that are associated with
 
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
this program um we're a little bit
 
00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
unclear as to what that would look like
 
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
um or sort of how that would be uh
 
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
facilitated as well as how it would be
 
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
funded there's not a funding mechanism
 
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's outlined within the proposed
 
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
legislation as to how this entity is
 
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to get um paid for the services uh
 
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
that it's making um or that it's going
 
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
to be uh providing um and we're not
 
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
really certain how the designation would
 
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
work it we would assume it would go
 
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
through the um or it seems like it could
 
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
go through the routine procurement
 
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
processes but we don't know if the
 
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
intent uh you know what the intent there
 
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
um necessarily uh is um so we think
 
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
those are are some pieces to be um to be
 
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 align:start position:0%
aware of um and then as it relates to
 
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
the to the funding itself that's going
 
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
to be going into the grant program um
 
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's our understanding that the funding
 
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
can come from several different points
 
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
as as drafted in the proposed language
 
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
private state or federal monies um but
 
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
it's not really specified currently so
 
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
that seems
 
00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
somewhat uh somewhat broad so we do
 
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
understand from talking with Early
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
Learning New Hampshire that there is an
 
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
idea or an intent there that within the
 
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
first year or so of the program that the
 
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
funding sources are going to be be
 
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
explored um but we're not really certain
 
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
what the Department's role would then be
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
and reaching you know securing grants or
 
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
anything of that matter and and we don't
 
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
as I noted we don't have Grant programs
 
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
that we currently administer it's really
 
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
not an area that we have uh expertise or
 
00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
staff already working on um we didn't
 
00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to do a fiscal note
 
00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
we weren't asked to do a fiscal note on
 
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill we've not really
 
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 align:start position:0%
had the chance to look at what kind of
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
costs would be Associated for the
 
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
Department in relation to administering
 
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 align:start position:0%
this program we do think that's
 
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
something that the department would need
 
00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
to look at and explore especially given
 
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a current uh similar
 
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
program that we're administering uh in
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
which we could relate it to um but I am
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if you have
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
any um and I'm more than happy to
 
00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
continue working with the committee and
 
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
and with the
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
sponsors if the um in looking towards
 
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
what could be workable again we do
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
understand that there's an expressed um
 
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
need here for this type of of program
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
and we do understand that so we're happy
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
to work going forward on any of
 
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
that questions from the committee yeses
 
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
question how much lead time would you
 
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
need to be able to set up the criteria
 
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to be accepting These funds if
 
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's what happens I think that's an
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
excellent question and I'm not sure that
 
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
the department is really in a spot right
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
now to make even a ballpark assessment
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
of that I mean I I would
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
imagine doing it off the C six months if
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
not a little bit more again this would
 
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
be a completely new area for us and
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
we've only just had a chance to look at
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
this language um as of yesterday um so I
 
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 align:start position:0%
do think that is something that the
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
department would need to explore in
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
order to even get you a a really good
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
time frame as to how long would we need
 
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
determine what we would need to
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
administer it um it is very outside this
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
um very different than anything that
 
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now just followup of
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
course follow up thank you for the
 
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
followup just so is it fair to say that
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
you would need at least six or more
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
months lead time at least if not more
 
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
but yes thank you again hard to nail
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
down a specific time frame at this
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
juncture I think um further questions
 
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
crean thank you chair thank you for
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that you're the best
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
person to answer this question but so
 
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
given that the Department of Labor
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the expertise are you aware
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
of another department in the state that
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
you think would be better suited or um
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%
do you think it's something that would
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
be appropriate here but just would
 
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
require a stretch I mean I think
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately at the thank you for the
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
question and I think at the end of the
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
day you know the it it really is on the
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
committee to determine where the
 
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate department is I mean there
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
are other departments within the state
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
system that have involvement um not just
 
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
with child care regulation I I believe
 
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
DHHS has some programs in relation to
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know licensing of child care
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
facilities there are other state
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
agencies that do Workforce Development
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor does not engage
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
in Workforce Development we don't engage
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
with employees in that way um the Bureau
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
of economic Affairs does a lot of
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development um New Hampshire
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
employment security does um some form
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
forms of work work uh placement with
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
individuals through their unemployment
 
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
program although I would defer to un uh
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
Unemployment Security on the mechanics
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
behind that I believe they also May
 
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
administer certain types of Grant
 
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
programs um whereas the department the
 
00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor currently does not
 
00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:17.790 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor currently does not
you're

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
welcome further questions uh I
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
definitely have some um I I know you
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
just saw this yesterday um is there any
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
insight as to why do was chosen for this
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
and not
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sure somebody will answer that
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
question and not not normally DHHS is
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
what trial centers deal with um was
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
there any any insight given to you on
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah yes thank you for the question
 
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
so we did have the opportunity to speak
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
with learning um Early Learning New
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our understanding is that
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh labor was chosen because we are the
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and have a
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
connection to the workforce um we you
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
know we do have um some laws that we
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over as it relates to
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
to apprenticeship programs I would note
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
the Department's role within those
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
programs is
 
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
relatively um slim as the US Department
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
of Labor so on the federal side um
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
handles more of the apprenticeship uh
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
pieces um so very little involvement
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
from the State Department of Labor in
 
00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:20.919 align:start position:0%
that context but that's our our general
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
understanding that it seemed to um to
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
the to those involved to be a good fit
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
because of that connection and I'm sure
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
they could speak to that probably a lot
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
more eloquently
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
I I can almost assure you someone will
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
um uh so this bill doesn't establish the
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
actual monetary money that goes into the
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
fund that's my understanding um so and I
 
00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:44.519 align:start position:0%
know you haven't had a chance to prepare
 
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note but
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
obviously let's say we pass this thing
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
it becomes law there's no fiscal
 
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
apportionment to it we're outside of the
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
budget time so there's no money until
 
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
next year at the earliest but would the
 
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
department then incur a cost regardless
 
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
of whether or not the the program is
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
funded or not just to try to set it up
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I IM it's
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
possible that we could again we've not
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
really had a chance to look at it um but
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
as I noted it's our understanding that
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
while you know that if the intent is for
 
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:17.959 align:start position:0%
this grant program to pass through us
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
and again it's our understanding that
 
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
the idea or intent is this designated
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
entity is going to be doing the primary
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
Administration but number one we would
 
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
have to make rules and regulations in
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
relation to that um you know we would
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
have ad administrative as well as
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
Financial oversight I mean I think the
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
LBA is going to you know require the
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
department to be able to go in and do
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
some forms of financial audit as well as
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
administrative oversight of how this is
 
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
being administered um so you know one we
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
would have to set that up it would take
 
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
some time in order for us to get rules
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
going so um and as I said we don't have
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
Grant programs currently um I think
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
there would be some staffing costs in
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
relation to that Financial oversight um
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that we I don't know at
 
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959 align:start position:0%
this point whether or not additional
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
staff would be needed but it may be
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
possible um I think we would really have
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
to look at that in order to determine
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
what that one what would that cost be
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
what would it look like how would that
 
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
impact you know what would that impact
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
be but I think it we would have to to
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
look at that I think it's fair to say
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
that there could
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
be okay um I may bring you back up here
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
just at some point just by so you could
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
hang around um I think there's going to
 
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
be more questions thank you so much
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
sorry there's no other questions in the
 
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
committee right I I was okay all right
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
Lorden good morning um to start I'd like

people um so my name is Lanna Lorden and
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief operating officer at White
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
birge Center in hener for the past 13
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
years I've been directly involved with
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
the management of two child care
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
programs these programs serve children
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
ages 9 months to 14 years of age with a
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
combined license capacity of 160 over my
 
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
time with white birch I've been able to
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
see the industry EB and flow um one
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
example I'd like to share with you is
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
from 5 years ago our agency hosted a
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
focus group um following our greatest
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
bout of turnover to date with 40% of our
 
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
while it's okay take your time you're
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
um while participating in this Focus
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
group um it was one of the hardest days
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
on the job for me um it was incredibly
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
eye openening um because it really
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
highlighted that our agency and the
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
industry needed to put forth um more
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
efforts in the area of Recruitment and
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
Retention and again this was five years
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
ago um for our employees our clients
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
families and
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
children um by addressing these
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
challenges the outcomes for children
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
families and the workforce were improve
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
approved but they need continual
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
attention and investment and we're
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
currently still doing so this is this
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
was very challenging and still is today
 
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
for small businesses nonprofit
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
organizations who must compete with
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
larger businesses and budgets for top
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
talent and
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
programs and additionally while the
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic reinforced and deepened public
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of the essential role of
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
Early Child Care and education working
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
families and the economy it didn't
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
address the systemic shortcomings that
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
have plagued um the above entities for
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
years and ultimately A system that has
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
been deeply underfunded and undervalued
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
another example um in 2019 the median
 
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
wage for childcare workers in New
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
$11.69 for preschool teachers the median
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
wage um was
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
$14.43 and in New Hampshire early
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
Educators with a bachelor's degree are
 
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
paid 22 and a half% less than their
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues in a K through 8 public
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
school system
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
that last statistic really resonated
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
with me and still does today as I hold a
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in elementary
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
education and a current teaching
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
certificate for K through 8 in public
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
school and I've experienced those lower
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
wages compared to my colleagues even
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
more so when I began in this field back
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
in 2010 it was solely because there
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
weren't any District positions um I left
 
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
teaching fifth grade because again there
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't any District positions so I had
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
to settle or so I thought um for a
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
toddler classroom teaching position at
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
White Birch where I am today that
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity however had a incredibly
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
Silver Lining um leading me straight to
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
where I am today um so little tead
 
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:13.480 align:start position:0%

enrollment of 69 children um and um I am
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
Council um this is a passion it's my
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
career um and so um I for a great
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
example of what happens yesterday
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
morning I was hit with hi I need to give
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
you my notice I'm going to teach in
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because I can make more
 
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
money and I'm giving you one week um I
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
have six babies who are going to lose
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
their teacher in one
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
week um I will make it work my families
 
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.590 align:start position:0%
week um I will make it work my families
come

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
first and it's really important that we
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
find a way to pay these teachers a
 
00:15:58.269 --> 00:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
livable decent wage so that they don't
 
00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
look it somewhere else and go oh I can
 
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
make more money there um and to top that
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
off that classroom is only half full
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
because we have been searching for a
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
teacher for eight
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
months um those children in that
 
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
classroom also have siblings in my
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
school and I will tell you my waiting
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
list doubles my enrollment at this time
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and that is phone call after phone
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
call week after week do you have
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
anything is something available did you
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
hire a staff and I'm pretty honest with
 
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.189 align:start position:0%
hire a staff and I'm pretty honest with
people

00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
um we have raised our staff um pay as
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
high as we possibly can without having
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
to raise our prices so that parents
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
can't afford them um and I think it's
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
really important that we look at this
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
field as a career as
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
education and we need to make sure that
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
these people these the staff this
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce who supports the workforce for
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
every other business in the
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
state is is given an opportunity to make
 
00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
a livable wage and have benefits to
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
support them so that they can they don't
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
have to worry about can I afford my rent
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
this month um and I hear that from my
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
staff we actually have a fund setup to
 
00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:16.039 align:start position:0%
try to help people when they're in an
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
emergency um you know they're important
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
to us um and our children deserve the
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
best in consistency and when we can't
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
pay people well and they move over to
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
Target because they can make $20 an hour
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
our kids are not our children are are
 
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.029 align:start position:0%
our kids are not our children are are
lacking

00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:32.039 align:start position:0%
lacking
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
consistency and in all honesty that
 
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
affects our Workforce because a mom who
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
goes to work and doesn't know who her
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
child is going to have for a teacher
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
because the teacher called out or we're
 
00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:46.039 align:start position:0%
looking for a new staff member can't
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
focus on their work to do their job well
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
um so we do our best to make sure that
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
we are consistent um I can tell you in
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
the 41 years I've done this I have spent
 
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0%
more time was a director in a
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
classroom um than I did when I was a
 
00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
teacher probably um and I I will not
 
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
argue with you I love every last minute
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
of it but we need to make sure that our
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
youngest children and our families are
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
getting the best we possibly can do and
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that our child care
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
Workforce is really important not just
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
to our parents and our families but also
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%

to housing a very close second you know
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire and also what do
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
you like and you know I'm struck by a
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
comment uh Jackie cow from Early
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
Learning New Hampshire has heard me say
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
this uh a number of times um but by a
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
comment that we heard in the Upper
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
Valley that it was specific to the Upper
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
Valley but I think is it applies to New
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RIT large and this young woman
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
said she said the Upper Valley is a
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
wonderful place to raise a family but
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
it's a very very very challenging place
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
to start one and I think that you know
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
really speaks uh in large measure you
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
know to you know how great New Hampshire
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
really is you know for young people to
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
have a career to be able to raise a
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
family um but it's incredibly difficult
 
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799 align:start position:0%
to do so to get that tow hold here and
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
child care costs we hear it you know
 
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
both we see it in the data and we hear
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
it anecdotally in all the conversations
 
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559 align:start position:0%
we have all across the state um so for
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
that reason you know we are looking at
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
any and all you know possible measures
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
you know to help make child care more
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
affordable for our families you know so
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
that not only the businesses that we
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
have here have the employees they need
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
to do the jobs but they communities have
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
the people they need to step up and
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer at our state and local boards
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
and that um you know that our our kids
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
our children you know have the uh you
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
know the the oversight and um that they
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
need so I'm happy to answer any
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
have are there questions from the
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%

primarily around childcare and um both
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
membership services for child care
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
programs um uh and advocacy for both the
 
00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
families they serve as well as the pro
 
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
you know the programs and their
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
Workforce and we also do some public
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
awareness raising around the importance
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
of the early years so um um also just
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
want to thank you um for all the work
 
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
you did last year as well to really
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
delve into the issue and to hear what
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
the issues were and I and I'm glad we're
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
here again um coming up with some of the
 
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
solutions um we um are in support of um
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1611 we think it's um it's
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's based on what we tried to do last
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
year as you might remember there was a
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
237 that was um there and it um did a
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
lot of terrific um Family Access uh
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
policy changes that are really going to
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
be very helpful to the hardworking um
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
parents here in New Hampshire to afford
 
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
childcare we're very pleased that that
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
was there in that bill as well which
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
ended up been hb2 but in that bill as
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
well was um asking for an ongoing
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
allocation to support the retention and
 
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
recruitment of the childcare Workforce
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
in the form of Grants ongoing grants
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
every year the main reason for that is
 
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
again to raise the earnings the
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
compensation the benefits of the
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce to keep them there
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
and attract them without going back
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
simply to the families they serve
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
because right now that's where it's
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
coming from they don't have it you know
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
at and and sometimes I'm asked the
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
question which which is more important
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
act affordability for families and um or
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
you know a strong stable Workforce and
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's a hard question right
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
like which which do you pay attention to
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
which do you invest in well frankly if
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
you don't have that strong stable
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce you know affording an empty
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
classroom does you no good and so that's
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
really what we're trying to prioritize
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
here and so when thinking about this
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
year so they did do a one-time
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
allocation of 15 million from General
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
funds um but they did not establish a
 
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce fund because it was
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
a one-time allocation and thinking about
 
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
what we needed to do this year in
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
preparation for next budget year um
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
speaking with many other um folks
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
including Senator Jeb Bradley who asked
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know this is a good year to
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
establish the workforce fund work on
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
getting it together get that
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place and then ask for
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
some funding to go into it in a budget
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
year so that is the plan um and then but
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
it does allow any bud any items to go
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
into it in talking with um commissioner
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
marfield Deputy Commissioner Albert and
 
00:24:08.909 --> 00:24:08.919 align:start position:0%
her team their team we did actually go
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
to many different Commissioners to talk
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
fund DHHS has a lot on their plate they
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
are really working hard to get the
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
family affordability policies in place
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work to be done they
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
have not they do not do grants directly
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
to employees they do it to employers and
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
the childcare community did say with the
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
payroll tax and all the other things you
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
know it would be a benef benefit if the
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
grants go directly to the employee
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
that's how this is set up that was a
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
direct request from the Child Care
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
community and we did talk to
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner Taylor Caswell um about
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
this and he was great and he applauds it
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
but thought you know actually he thought
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
Bea was not necessarily the best place
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
and talking to other Commissioners we
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
did talk to commissioner katus and
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner labors we did talk
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
to commissioner um marfield and frankly
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
I felt knowing what the childcare
 
00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:02.919 align:start position:0%
Community needs and and wants Department
 
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
of Labor and commissioner maryel as a
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
partner just seems so logical yes I
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
understand that they don't do a grant
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
program the idea for this though is
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
there the regulatory Agency on the side
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
of workers right you know so so it seems
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
so logical for us to really partner with
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
them and also to make that strong
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
statement about how Child Care supports
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
the labor forces all labor forces not
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
just so that was the primary reason we
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
started those conversations with the
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor are eager to look at
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
how this is unprecedented to having a
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
grant go out to the employee like this
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
for this essential Workforce so
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
yeah will we be taking questions I
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
assume so yes represent
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
Phillips my apologies for being late
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so I
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just joining in and I'm reviewing
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment too but I'm interested in
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
if you would support or maybe this
 
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
sponsors have considered like a sunset
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
on this so say we actually solve this
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
miracle crisis of child care and we have
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
an abundance all of a sudden of child
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
care workers who are being paid and we
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
now have too many people who want to
 
00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
work in this so I just so as a as a
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal conservative right this the the
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
angle is that is there is there some
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
sort of metric where you would say 5
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
years from now if we can frontload all
 
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
of these good workers getting young kids
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
out of high school to come and want to
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
work in childcare um is there a a a year
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
or anount years or some sort of place
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
where we could put a sunset on this and
 
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
then dismiss this I think that's a
 
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
terrific discussion to have I mean you
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't want it there if you don't need it
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
at the same time what we do know is that
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
a person working in childcare child care
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
professional earns less than half a um
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
per year than a public school teacher
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
for instance and has no retirement
 
00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
benefits and has no blah blah blah blah
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
right so but I would be certainly
 
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
willing to to think about what that
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
could look like you know if you get to
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
this point is the fund needed because
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
again what we're trying to do is again
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
have the the state investment saying why
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
they're investing and you know why this
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce as we mentioned um we might
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
not have mentioned it yet but for every
 
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
one childcare teacher it supports about
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
eight different um children in the you
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
know to be able to be there who then
 
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
have maybe you know maybe you know 10 to
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
16 parents so it's really like all
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
Industries it's having trouble but this
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
one is a little different because it
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
allows the other Industries to go to
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
work so I think that's a conversation we
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
could have what does it look like that
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
it's enough right so yeah thank you
 
00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:33.669 align:start position:0%
it's enough right so yeah thank you
representative

00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so just thinking
 
00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:39.799 align:start position:0%
about where this sits
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
administratively I appreciate you kind
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
of helping us through your process
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
understanding sort of the process of
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
elimination you went through that landed
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
you at the Department of Labor y um can
 
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
you tell me a little bit more
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
about the conversations you had with the
 
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
other Commissioners um their concerns
 
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
about having it sit with them that
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
eventually LED you to labor because we
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
hearing from Lab the department of labor
 
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
today it's you know we're trying to
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
figure out what the right place to house
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
it is and it's helpful like excellent if
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
T if commissioner Caswell had concerns
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
why doesn't it live with ba Etc and to
 
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
be honest I don't think he had concerns
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
about the grants or the workforce fund
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
just felt maybe a different agency it
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
was as simple as that it wasn't anything
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
in depth about that we don't do this or
 
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
we won't do this or we have enough work
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was really
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
um when we mentioned who we were else
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
who were talking said oh yeah that
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
sounds logical honestly and to be frank
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
it was it was commissioner marold and
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
our and our conversation with it felt
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
like such a strong partnership
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
possibility here in the way that he he's
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
got a strong team over there even though
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know they haven't done this before I
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
know this can be crafted in a way that's
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
really again it's the first time doing
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
it this way so it does have to be built
 
00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:51.549 align:start position:0%
it this way so it does have to be built
together

00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah okay uh further questions from the
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%

Midstate Health Center uh we have uh
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
four locations in uh four different
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
communities we serve 29 communities um
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
in central uh New Hampshire um my core
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
business of course is primary care
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health dental

00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
Specialty Services I'm here today take a
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
a few moments out of my schedule to talk
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
about uh child care one of the gems in
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
our Crown at Midstate is that we have a
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
we have 60 Children daycare center
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
called little antlers I've been on
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
Channel 9 a couple of times touting that
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
um and we get great reviews from our
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
federal delegation as well as our uh
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
local delegation as well um we have some
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
advantages that some of the other
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
daycare centers don't have which is that
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh we do give our staff a pension we do
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
give them health insurance and we do
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
give them uh free tuition if they have a
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
child uh in our daycare center however
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
we pay around 17 or maybe $18 an hour
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
and over the past uh three or four
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
months out of a staff of 15 full-time
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
and part-time we had it uh we lost four
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
staff members which really um impacts
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
our ability to staff the U uh the
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
agency um so
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
use me as an example I have some of the
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
stuff that's written in this in this
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and it's still not enough
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
there are times when I could testify and
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
say money doesn't solve a problem here's
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
an instance where money does solve the
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
problem it's $17 an hour $18 an hour
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
many of these folks are single single
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
parents or they they don't have another
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
source of income one of my assistant
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
directors works at Mar
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
to augment her her income now a lot of
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
us do Moonlight and but the fact of the
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
matter is they have to work a second job
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
to make things to make things work
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
irrespective of what agency finally
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
handles this what a shame to lose at
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
least this first step in the opportunity
 
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
to make things better and remember this
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is just the first step it
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
creates the pot there's no money in it
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
it just creates the pot and um I can't
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
tell you firmly enough and I've
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
testified uh Jackie knows I've been at
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
some of her things here um please this
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
is so vitally important you know when we
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
we thought about opening this I talked
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
to the local hospital they didn't want
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
to do anything with us I talked to
 
00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:22.039 align:start position:0%
businesses they didn't want to do
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
anything with us and every year that we
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
have this open it costs us us Midstate
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
$100,000 plus a year to subsidize this
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
and that's at a wage of $17 an
 
00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:39.559 align:start position:0%
hour and we have 60 kids now we're
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
licensed for a 100 I'll never see it
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
because we'll never have enough staff
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
because we don't pay enough in there's
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
too much competition elsewhere and
 
00:32:51.149 --> 00:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
what's really troubling about this uh
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee members is that this trickles
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
all the way through the community people
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
can't find uh employeers can't find
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
people to do their jobs because they
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
have to take care of their children and
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
and to me this is an this is the first
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
step of a greater opportunity to make a
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
difference without a huge impact on the
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
state budget so I humbly say please
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
consider this let this legislation pass
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
figure out who the agency that's going
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
to handle it don't let that stand in the
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
way get this thing done I strongly
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%

the New Hampshire state director for the
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
campaign for a familyfriendly economy we
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
are uh based here in New Hampshire
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
working to advance policies and and
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
build support for um efforts that can
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
help families to make ends meet and be
 
00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:33.079 align:start position:0%
there for their families when they need
 
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
to be and so Child Care is of course a
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
central part of what we work to advance
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank you for um
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
considering this bill and I also want to
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I didn't look up your voting
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
history but I bet many of you voted for
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
the budget um last year that included um
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
the 15 million dollar that some people
 
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
before me have spoken about to um to
 
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
help with a one-time expenditure um in
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce Workforce support what I think
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
is really um helpful about this bill is
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
that in a non-budget year it gives an
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to think about we do we do
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
still need this kind of resource and
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of support but where does it
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
really belong and how do we get it to um
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
be structured in such a way that it can
 
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
work that the most efficiently and best
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
that it can I really appreciate the
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
for working to get these this money out
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
the door I think that it is still in
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
process there they have a lot you know
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's an enormous department they have a
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
lot on their plate and I think it's sat
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
with them because they do so much else
 
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
on child care with the child care
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and Licensing but
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
this is really a business and economic
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
development program this Workforce fund
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's not like the other child care
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
programs that they run which are you
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
know about scholarships to families that
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
need assistance Etc this is looking to
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
solve a problem that businesses have now
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
and that is our Workforce crisis I am
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
sure that when each and every one of you
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
is talking to people in your your
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
districts you are hearing about the
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
workforce crisis from Employers in your
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
districts um everybody is struggling to
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
find workers the reason to invest in the
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
child care sector um when everybody is
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
looking for workers is because the
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
single largest factor keeping people who
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
are outside of the workforce from
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
working right now is access to care um
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
and so we could have additional people
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
entering our Workforce if they could get
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
off of the weight list that you've heard
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
about from some of the child care
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
centers here and had care for their um
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
for their little ones
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
and so this is a um way to get more
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
people not only working in the child
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
care sector but working in all of our
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
sectors and so that's why it's really a
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
business and economic development
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
program so I do hope that as you're
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
considering this bill what you're
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
considering is what the right home for
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
it is not whether we need it so I I
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
appreciated um you know representative
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
your comment that you know that's part
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
of what you're thinking about and
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
deliberating is is what is the right
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
home because I think that's really the
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
question and so I hope that um and I
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
think that you know I know you don't
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
have a lot of time but in an in a
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
non-budget year you have a little bit
 
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
more time to consider that piece so that
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
then next year when it's another budget
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
year you're able to consider and what
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
can we put toward that you know and and
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
think about what the right amount of
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
resources are within the context of the
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
funding plan for the whole state and and
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
the resources um that you're considering
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
as part of the budget so thank you and
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions okay questions
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%

concerns um I do not like the Department
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
of Labor for this um I know that's not
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
going to be the most popular statement
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
in the world and I I I was telling my
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues I can't believe I'd ever say
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
these words I actually think DHHS should
 
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
handle this and that you should write
 
00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:26.839 align:start position:0%
this day down um cuz we haven't always
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
haven't always gotten along with them
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
and that's okay um but I do believe they
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
are actually the proper Agency for it um
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is when you go down
 
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
and you start looking at these
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
benefits uh with the exception of um the
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
student loan repayment these are all
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
benefits that normally flow from the
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
employer um the purpose of putting it in
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
the department of labor was to have it
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
flow directly to the employee um I am
 
00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
not a huge fan fan of that um I'm happy
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
to Aline about why I'm not a huge fan of
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
that but in my in my mind it effectively
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
makes them kind of Quasi state employees
 
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
to an extent um I would rather if we are
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to do something like this have the
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
the the student loan repayment like just
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
an FYI like from the Republican side of
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
the cogress that's going to have to come
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
off like we're not going to be in the
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
business of having the government repay
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
student loans it's a whole thing I'm
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
sorry everything else is actually very
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
common employer benefit
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
so what I would rather see is some sort
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
of system where this fund is established
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
right and then the employers can emplo
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
the employers which you define in the
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
backs side of your amendment can then
 
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
apply for direct reimbursement of proven
 
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
costs right um so right now they fill
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
out you know we fill out the CCO Grant
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
and all sort of stuff at the end of the
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
year um we could find a way for the DHHS
 
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:49.039 align:start position:0%
to set up this system where it's like
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
all right we have a certain amount of
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
funds allocated you know certain amount
 
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
and you prove these costs and then has
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
to be direct repayment of those proven
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
costs not what you think the costs will
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
be but what the costs actually are um
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we we by by we I
 
00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:08.039 align:start position:0%
mean the Republican side of the aisle um
 
00:56:11.029 --> 00:56:11.039 align:start position:0%
we are not going to start preferencing
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
certain Child Care Centers over others
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
um I know that there is a desire to pick
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
child care centers that take the state
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
scholarship over ones that don't we're
 
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
not our side's not going to get on board
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
with that we treat everybody the same
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of Child Care Center that
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't take the child care center
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
scholarship um I'm sure there are some
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
um but the overwhelming vast majority do
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm defin for the record mine does
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
um but I I do not want to get into the
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
business of effectively picking winners
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
and losers because they do something we
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
like or something we don't like so that
 
00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
is kind of my um opening Salvo of my
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this um and and those things
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
which I think keeps the underlying
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill there it keeps
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
probably for being honest 90% of the
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
bill there um but makes it um I think
 
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
Much More pwle Much More functioning um
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have child private Child
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
Care employees going to the state of New
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor for
 
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of a benefit that I don't
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
know how they would like how would they
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
prove they got PTO or they didn't get
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
PTO you you can see like these questions
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
arising it's these are all employer
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
benefits just have them flow through the
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
employer have it come from DHHS there's
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
no reason to have the CH the child care
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
center uh child care provider work with
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
a new Department um and that's that's
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
kind of my thoughts on it so definitely
 
00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
that was a lot so representative MC
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
Williams uh thank you very much for
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
outlining your concerns with the bill
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
chair Barry um I think that regardless
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
of who the agency is I'm pretty agnostic
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
about that specific thing I'll let my
 
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
other colleagues speak if they have
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
strong thoughts about it but I think
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
having a good administrator is more
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
important than having it be a specific
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
administrator um so that being said I
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
think that that's okay um I understand
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
your concerns about most of these being
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
things that flow through the employer
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
except for student loan repayment and so
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
I would raise you instead of student
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
loan repayment can we talk about um
 
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for related Education
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
costs because there's always continuing
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
ad each year um so any any of those that
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
can be proven with a receipt right
 
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
because you had said that you wanted to
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
have proven costs after the fact so I
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
would say education um with related
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
education with receipt obviously you
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
can't go become a plumber while you're
 
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
working for a child care center and get
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
your education reimbursed there but um I
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
think that that at least it's in the
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
spirit of you spent some money on
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
education and we'd like to make sure
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
that you can stay uh in the career that
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
you've chosen with the education costs
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
that you've incurred um and then finally
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
you said you don't want them enrolled in
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
Services child care scholarship program
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how important that is
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
Mis interpreting I don't want so there's
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
a clause in in the B that uh as the
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
funds get exhausted they're preferenced
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
I don't want I don't want any preference
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay um because because it's it's you
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
actually because when I first read it I
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
I misunderstood it but you basically
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
giving this to every child care center
 
00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
in the state effectively cuz you have
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
number two is a catchall nonprofit and
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
privately owned Center based and family
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
based childcare programs right y um
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
which you probably actually could
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
probably just be number two number that
 
00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:36.039 align:start position:0%
could be it on its own um what we don't
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
want is the preference it's it's uh so
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
just remove b b on second page just take
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
out B um take out B I think the rest of
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
it's fine okay um that's fine and then I
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
actually like your proposition on the
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
student loan because as I've said before
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
in our hearings you know getting these
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
teachers into Lead Teacher positions
 
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
requires a CDA that's roughly about
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
$500 um that's right in line with what
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do um so and that's
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
again it's a proven cost after the fact
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
um as a a something that very well
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
easily could once again flow through the
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
employer we could we call that related
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
education expenses yeah sure yeah yeah
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
Prov yeah proven continuing education
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
costs or something like
 
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
that representative crean thank you um I
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
will just throw out there as someone
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
who's kind of tangentially involved in
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
HR and recruiting and things in my uh
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
day job uh student loan repayment is
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
definitely something that is becoming
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
more popular as um something that's
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
offered and um through employers as as
 
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
you mentioned so um I don't necessarily
 
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
have strong opinions about taking it out
 
01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:41.559 align:start position:0%
or leaving it in but uh I just did want
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
to throw that out there and then my
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
other question was um if we get rid of
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
42b um do we need to replace it with any
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
other language about uh what to do if
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
requests succeed of available funding
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
like make it first come first served or
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's definitely a good point
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
um because I think the other thing is is
 
01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
how is
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
this there's there's an imaginative pot
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
pot of money right we don't know what
 
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
the pot of money is um that was a
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
concern that my cus was willing to
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
overlook just FYI um but there's this
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
magic there's this imaginary pot of
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
money that doesn't yet exist and might
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
might not ever exist who knows um the
 
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
question is is how is it allocated right
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
so does it if we don't set up some sort
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
of structure we don't allow DHS to set
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
up some sort of regulated structure
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
there's going to be this massive Jan one
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
go to the well as quickly as you can um
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
versus you know kind of what they do
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
effectively with the other grants that
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
they Dole out um which is it's usually
 
01:01:44.349 --> 01:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
based on like um not well one of is not
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
even based on act R one's based on alloc
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
um capacity um but that would be
 
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
something that the HH like I would be in
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
favor of some structure where it was
 
01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
based on in enrollment um I really don't
 
01:01:57.069 --> 01:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
like doing it based on capacity I
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
actually like doing it based on
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
enrollment um and then um and just have
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
it be divvied up proportionally um and
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
then some clause about what to do with
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
unexpended funds in the back in the last
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
quarter of the year now we're getting
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
really into the fiscal weeds um but
 
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
you'd have to figure out something to do
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
with unexpended funds at the end of the
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
year or you just leave it in there and
 
01:02:16.589 --> 01:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
let it be invested and and the interest
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
rolls back into the accounts but that's
 
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
a question for our good friends at
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal yes representative wner some of
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
those things I think would be inter
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
um if we in we do need to include in
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
here that the department no matter what
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
department it is can promate rules so a
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
lot of the things that you just
 
01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:38.039 align:start position:0%
mentioned would be in the promation of
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
the rules um that whoever whichever
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
Department it is um has
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
it I guess I know that I'm trying to
 
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:53.559 align:start position:0%
imagine the kind of administrative
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
structure we're going going to need if
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
we're having every child care provider
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
in the state giving receipts to someone
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
to be reimbursed it is going to be I
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
think an enormous administrative
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
structure and I'm not sure that anyone
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
is ready for that um I think the idea
 
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
behind this was that there would be that
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
Tri care providers would be eligible for
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
a grant and then these are the ways they
 
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
could use it and that they wouldn't be
 
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
sending in individual receipts because I
 
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
administratively very difficult for
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
anyone um any department or any entity
 
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
to really manage that kind of that kind
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
of system um so I do have a question
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
that I might want to ask somebody in the
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
audience if you would allow that yeah my
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
first let me respond to that um if you
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't have some sort of system about
 
01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
proven cost then you're just giving them
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
money right and and and can raise their
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
hand and say I I swear I'm using this
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
for student loan repayment or talk where
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
discount um they can you know but the
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
reality is is like I know how money
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
works and if you give somebody a check
 
01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
and you don't say show me the receipts
 
01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
they may or may not do with that money
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
what you want them to do and that's just
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
human like that's just human nature like
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry um you know I that's that's
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I want I think it's
 
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
actually more appropriate to go through
 
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
the employer um is it's just you're just
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
I mean at that point from effectively
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
you're saying like why don't we just
 
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839 align:start position:0%
give child providers Child Care actual
 
01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
workers money um it would be a lot
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
easier just to be like here's you know
 
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
here's five grand have a great day you
 
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
know see you next January um and I I
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
that's something that we were we're
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
never getting on board with that so um
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
but anyways yeah who do you want to hear
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
from the audience representative War
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
well I'm not I'm not really sure I'm
 
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
looking out there in the audience I just
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
want to know if anyone has any
 
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
information about this I know that there
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
have been many states in the United
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
States have already set up Grant
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
programs for child care providers and I
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
just wondered if someone might say
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
something about what what departments if
 
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
you know what departments are running
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
those and to if they are direct grants
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
or if they're doing a receipt kind of
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
process and hi again I'm Jackie cow from
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
Early Learning New Hampshire um I think
 
01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
part of what we as a as a field as a
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
group of um Co ition members here
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
talking directly with the field both to
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
employers and to employees was really
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do something that we thought
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
would be most effective and that was
 
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
again the employers were saying they've
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
got enough on their plate they don't you
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
know some some again you know studying
 
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
retention it's it can be very particular
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
to what this particular employee needs
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
they may or may not need health
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
insurance they may or may not once you
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
start having the employer doing all
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
these benefits um this isn't actually
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
affecting their operating supports right
 
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
this is a grant to really raise the
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
earnings of individual childcare
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
employees to keep them there and the
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
intent you know again designing it with
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know Department of Labor and others
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
is there's there are studies that show
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
if there's a couple of Grants a year
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's better than the $5,000 in the
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year thank you very
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
much good luck you know it's you know it
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
really is that if you do if you do again
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
if you have certain amount of money and
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
you figure out um what it would be per
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
employee those employees can apply for
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
that Grant perhap probably three times a
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
year that tends to keep retention
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
knowing they're going to be able to
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
access money in this month and then that
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
month and that month then you would you
 
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
know you could also have some states
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
have done things why you know you have
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
to stay in the job or you have pay them
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
because they did stay in the job for the
 
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
last four months right you verify that
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
you've been in the job for the last four
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
months you've been doing this you're a
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
full-time employee this is the stip and
 
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
you're earning how are you planning on
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
do on using that money for what your
 
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
need is now figuring out you know again
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out the best way for
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
accountability without having it Stacks
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
and stacks and stacks and receipts and
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
receipts but the idea really was again
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
to to administer these grants on an
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis is in a very simple way to
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
really really good ta really having
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
we've learned with a lot of the grants
 
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
that have gone out and you know
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
representative Barry better than anyone
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
else at this table too how tough it can
 
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
be to understand what the what the
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
grants are about some people are not
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
even applying because they're not sure
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
we really don't want that to happen to
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
the workforce and you add that extra
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
layer of employer and I understand the
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
reasoning of that but I really think you
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
know we we really felt based on the on
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
the information from the field
 
01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
that if these could be employee grants
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
other states have done it in different
 
01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
ways um Maryann behind me knows a little
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
bit more Washington DC did a stipend of
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
$10,000 a year from a fund that they
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
were able to access there's different
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
ways of doing it main did $200 a month
 
01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know um but it really was for the
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
employees some of them I think did go to
 
01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:17.789 align:start position:0%
employees some of them I think did go to
the

01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:17.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
employer so but yeah thank you um yeah
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
you know so going back to this like I
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
think it's like if you give people PTO
 
01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
well that's a tax liability now because
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
PTO is a PTO is a a pay it's money so
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know how how are we accounting you
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
know or is this you can see all these
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
questions that get opened up right is
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
the state going to withhold the seven
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
the state going to withhold the employer
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
side and the employee side on the PTO
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
benefit that's being dled out right like
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
that's why like I get the idea of going
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
to the employee um but you are you're
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
you're dealing out benefits that
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
traditionally come from employers and
 
01:08:59.070 --> 01:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with people who may not
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
understand the tax implications of
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
getting of getting PTO um and not
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
understanding like I'm self-employed so
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
I know that when somebody hands me a
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
check for $100 I have to put $25 aside
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
and I get to spend $75 like I know that
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
because I have to pay the IRS every year
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
um childcare employees are not used to
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
that they come to me in January 31
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
where's my W2 I want my refund um that's
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
not you're not setting that system up
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're setting them up for actually kind
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
of a system uh where they may be in in
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
some trouble um uh kind of just a
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
administratively by the way can we throw
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
G like we throw J into F like tele
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
medicine is mostly covered by Insurance
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
anyways so just like can we just toss
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
that oh yeah if I may there actually is
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
an option to do and a lot of childcare
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
um employees are doing it now that they
 
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
many of them have health insurance but
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
they have very high deductibles and a
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
lot of them do not have teleah health
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
and if they do it's not 247 there are
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
some options out there that are very
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
affordable for tella Health that New
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire folks are using now and it'd
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
be great if they could be
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
supported I'm not talking about getting
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
rid of it I'm just talking about I'm
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
just talking about for the purpose of
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
concisus you're dealing with health
 
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
benefits put l why not just put the why
 
01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
not put the other health benefit in the
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
line with the health benefit that's just
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
purely I'm not talking about getting rid
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
of it I'm talking about administratively
 
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
just St it up there um yeah just yeah
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
like less is trust me cuz Finance is
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
going to have a field day with it too um
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know Sor go ahead yeses yes thank
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
listening um I've I've applied for
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
Grants there's criteria that shall be
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
met when you apply for a grant these
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
receipts can be part of that criteria so
 
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
if we have an employee
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
who is eligible and the employer is
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
going going to apply the employer gives
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
the employee this incentive to say bring
 
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
me your receipts I'm applying for a
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
grant I believe you should benefit from
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
that Grant bring me your receipt so it
 
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
can be included in the Grant
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
application and it helps the
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
employer because there are hopefully
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
many employees who are going to to be
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
eligible right so it helps the employer
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
with his or her grant
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
writing to include that so that's why I
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually I I agree that it should be the
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
employer and as far as the receipts are
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that can be handled in that
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
manner yeah and and remember like the
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
whole point of this is retention right
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
so you know if you're if you're filing
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
for expenses after the fact right well
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know that the expenses you know that
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
the benefit was dled out right you know
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
it was given right and the whole point
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
is to give it to retention um and you
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
know like giving things for in the
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
future always concerns me because it's
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
like you don't know what's going to
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
happen like once they have the money you
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to happen um but
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
like you know I I always and I've said
 
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
this before I always look at things to
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
the lens of um you know my own center
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
right so like we just did our entire
 
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
Center just did our reup on CPR I paid
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
for it we stayed after they all got uh
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
they all got time and a half because we
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
were on OT right I just ate that as the
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
employer right um because my teachers
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
have to have CPR like it's just one of
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
the deals so you know it's you're
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with things
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
that um I I I really am Adam about this
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with the exception of the
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
student loan repayment which I am
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
totally cool to move to the CTE yeah the
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
CTE continuing education um you know cuz
 
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about like Pro Solutions
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that um I'm totally cool
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
to go there I think that's actually way
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
more agreeable um but I I really am like
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
I am stuck on it it needs to flow
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
through the employer it needs to be for
 
01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
appr proven costs because the the idea
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
is is if you tell the employer hey we're
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
going to start um the States you know
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
you tell them you know all right we've
 
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
gotten this much money in the pot you
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
know you're going to get this much to do
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
over these benefits prove that you're
 
01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
doing it um now the employer is going to
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
be able to offer these benefits right
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
they're not going to not do it I mean
 
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
why would anybody why would any
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
employer not give I'm using air quotes
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
here cuz I don't believe I
 
01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
philosophically I have trouble saying
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
this free um benefits um why would any
 
01:13:33.149 --> 01:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
employer not do that it would be
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
ludicrous not to do that um it would be
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
you would be run out of business your
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
your competition alone would put you
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
under the ground
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
um if it's coming from the state the
 
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
state has never not paid me I'll say
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
not yeah and like
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah uh go ahead yes thank you
 
01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
chair Barry um I just wanted to mention
 
01:13:59.229 --> 01:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
you know in hearing this we're all
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
sitting here because we're acknowledging
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
that there's a child care crisis and
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
what it makes me think back to is during
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
covid and I know um chair Barry you're a
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
small business owner I am as well and
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is a bit of a political landmine
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
but what happened when covid shut us all
 
01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
down as small business owners is we
 
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
recognized we need to get money in the
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
hands of these businesses right away
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
with you know removing some of these
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
rails and so what it makes me think of
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
is to address these issues we have the
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
the quickest way to get the the extra
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
sort of funds to our our Workforce but
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
what if we looked at it where we said
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an annual audit that
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
takes place and people get pulled
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
randomly to be ensured that it's you
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
know being spent the way that we wanted
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
to be spent a random I I still don't
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
like it being a random audit of the
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
employee um because it's just it's just
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
not I just I I know it's just not going
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
to end well it's just I'm just telling
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
you it is not going to end well um the
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
employer has accounting mechanisms
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
already in place right the teacher does
 
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
not have the teacher likely does not
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
have the same account like the teacher
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a QuickBooks account right
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
every every dollarin and every dollar
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
out of my Center goes through a
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
QuickBooks account right you ask me how
 
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
much profit I made last month I can tell
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
you in 10 seconds um because I have to
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
account for every dollar because I have
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
to give it to the IRS I have to give it
 
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
to our friends at Dr right um you're
 
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
you're involving people you're giving
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
money to people who directly you I I
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
actually think you will be causing them
 
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
more harm by giving it to them directly
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
than just allowing the benefit to flow
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
through the employer which it every
 
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
single one of these is e everything that
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
like I'll go back to my own Center I pay
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
the $28 fee for background check if you
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
come and you work for my center and you
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
don't have your background check I give
 
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
I give you $28 check to the Department
 
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
of Safety you go on down to Haz and
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
drive like I do that right um so you
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
could actually see like centers like
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
mine you might see cost shifting right I
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
might say ah you know I don't need to
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
pay your $28 you can reimburse yourself
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
state right you might see cost shifting
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
so it is I'm telling you it is a much
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
better system to just run it through the
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
employer run it through DHHS um and not
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
try to do a direct Dole a direct payment
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
to a person a a person who doesn't you
 
01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
know doesn't understand account like I'm
 
01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
not trying I I love our teachers they're
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
some of the best people in the world
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
right they're not accountants right um
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
they didn't that's not they didn't raise
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
their hand to be accountants they raise
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
their hand to be teachers God bless them
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
I can't do it I was in a classroom two
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
days ago and six hours in I was like oh
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
my god um but you know I like handling
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
money like I I'm that I'm good at um
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
you're you're asking you're you're going
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
to give them something that I don't
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's a way to give them the benefit
 
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't involve them assuming the
 
01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:53.990 align:start position:0%
that doesn't involve them assuming the
liability

01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
right yes so R Barry just to to respond
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
to what you said and and um I certainly
 
01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from but
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
again thinking back during covid I'm a
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
lawyer and not an accountant U there's a
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
reason I have a bookkeeper but I know
 
01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
when my business needed those funds
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
there were very clear categories you
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
could spend those funds on and this is a
 
01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
to me this is a pretty small pool of
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
different categories and um you know it
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
just wasn't very difficult to keep a
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
fold and a record of here's how I here's
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
how I spend my funds so um I'm not sure
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
that I fully disagree that it would be
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
too difficult on the
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
employees I I I hear that uh I would
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
also point out you have a
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
JD right um You are a highly educated
 
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
person right um You are not you do not
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
need a JD to be a teacher um I'm not
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
saying you're bad I'm not saying it's
 
01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
bad don't get me wrong we have plenty of
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
bachelor's teachers I'm you're you're
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting what I'm saying I'm
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
saying you are putting them into a
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
situation where you might be set setting
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
them up for failure we can get them the
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
benefits that they want we can get them
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
the benefits that I think they need we
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
can do that without creating tax
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
liabilities for them right the PTO
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
benefit alone is a tax liability the
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
employer pays 7% of every of every
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
paycheck you get your employer is
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
responsible you have 14% payroll tax
 
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
your employer is charge of 7% how does
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
that work if the money doesn't flow
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
through the employer how does it work
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
the answer is it doesn't it doesn't work
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
because they're at that point are they
 
01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
considered self-employed all right so
 
01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
now their tax liability goes from 14% in
 
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
which the employer is paying 7 to 25% so
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to hand them money for PTO
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
do you think they're going to know do
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
have the where are they going to have
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
the tax training to know they need to
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
take 25% put it in their pocket and put
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
into savings account because they're
 
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
going to owe it are they going to start
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
owing coure release right or they just
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
going to owe on April 15th these are all
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
things that you're setting up you're not
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
setting this program up for Success
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're you're setting you are setting it
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
up I believe you're setting people up
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
for failure um and it's it's going like
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's not from the heartless I'm not here
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not up here saying don't do this
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
right I'm not saying here don't do this
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
benefit you're not hearing those words
 
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
come out of my mouth what I'm saying is
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't do it directly to the employee
 
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
because you're going to set up things
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
that are not you're going to set them up
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
into a system that is not that they're
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
not may not be ready to do you know
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
these are people who file W2s right they
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't I have to I have to when I do mine
 
01:19:26.189 --> 01:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
I have to file 10 I have to send out
 
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
1099s I have to take in 1099s right I
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
have this whole it takes me basically a
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
month to do my taxes right they are you
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
are effectively making them small
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
businesses when you do this so now like
 
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
these you're setting this this situation
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
up it is just so much simpler to just
 
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
run it through the employer employer who
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
already has a Rel every employer in
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
share CS that I know has a relationship
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
with DHHS they know the grant they know
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
the grant fund they get the the survey
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
monkey thing right um You they're
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
already equipped to do that you are now
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
shifting that onto a whole group of
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
people I could actually make the
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
argument that some of them may not take
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of it because it may be
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
confusing it's just way easier if it
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
flows to the employer and I actually
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
think you'll get more good to more
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
teachers that way than if you would if
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
you just tried to say hey you can apply
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
for this um you know good luck cuz you
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
know you have all sorts of other
 
01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
questions right like how are you going
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
to know notify these teachers that this
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
is available if their employer doesn't
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
tell them right how are they even going
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
to know about it because are you going
 
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
to send out certified mail to every
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
person who has a current background
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
check with DHHS you could do that right
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
but if you just but you send out to the
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
350 some odd childcare providers in the
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire hey this
 
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
program's coming on board uh by July 1st
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
this fund's going to be established this
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
is what we're trying to do by the way
 
01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
give us some feedback how do you think
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
it'll work right it's a way better
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
process to deal with that pool of people
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
than the than every every teacher in the
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire you see what I'm
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
saying it's not about not giving them
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
the benefit it's about how do we get the
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
benefit to them effectively without
 
01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
failure thank you Mr chairman in another
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
auditor I really really wasn't mean and
 
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:23.719 align:start position:0%
I really wasn't horrible however
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
if you have ever
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
seen the condition of the
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.870 align:start position:0%
 
audit

01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
shocking most PE W2 filers
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
don't understand the necessity to hold
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
on to receipts what receipts they should
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
hold on to what receipts they they don't
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
need to coffee stains peanut butter
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
stains and
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
all it is so much better and more
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
efficient for an
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
employer to be the one to hold all that
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
information considering the fact that if
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
you are an
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
employer you have a
 
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.990 align:start position:0%
employer you have a
bookkeeping

01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
Department there's where all the
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
receipts are held it is in one place
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
instead of some auditor walking into a
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
W2 Filer and saying H not IRS but DHHS
 
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
or whomever is going to be the auditor
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
and saying I want your receipts they're
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
going to be uh uh uh the baby formula
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
spilled all over it so I threw it
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
out it works better it's more efficient
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's more streamlined and that's why I
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
like the
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
employer as opposed to the
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
employee can I share something uh sure
 
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
let me let me give an anecdotal story
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
before we do that um so I have I just
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
recently gave um I just recently gave
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
one of my employees a promotion uh
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
brought her up to assistant director and
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
my game plan is to make her the director
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
so I can go off start another child care
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
center um she got a rais with that
 
01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
obviously more responsibilities more
 
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
money right she had a tax liability
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
after she filed she came to me said Ross
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh the IRS says I owe him $0000 what am
 
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:25.719 align:start position:0%
I going to do and she's like well first
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
first thing she said is did you do my
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
taxes right I said that is all automated
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
like I don't you know what goes in like
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
you fill out your thing online I don't
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
do math like QuickBooks does the math
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
but we I actually sat down with her and
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
went over it and yeah like she because
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the raise she owed a tax
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
liability she's not going to be able to
 
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
make April 15th I know that um I had to
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
go over with I I told like hey I've been
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
here trust me um like you know what
 
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to do is you're going to
 
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
file on the you're going to file for uh
 
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
you're file on the 15th you're going to
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
send them saying you know you this money
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to set up a payment plan
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to charge you 18% interest
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
rate by the way financially you need to
 
01:23:59.470 --> 01:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
get that paid off as quickly as possible
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
because 18% is gross
 
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
um imag so I imagine that conver the
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
reason I'm so passionate about this is I
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
imagine having that
 
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
conversation with every one of my
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
teachers who takes PTO and then gets
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
some form of W2 or something or 1099
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire and then
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
they go and they plug it in and then
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
they're like oh I owe two grand to the
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
IRS in April that is going to happen
 
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
like if that benefit that PTO benefit
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
which nobody have I've I've heard nobody
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
say take it out so if that PTO benefit
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
sticks in there and it's applicable
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's tax liability with
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
that that conver that that horrible
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
conversation I had to have with by the
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
way single mother just so you know
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
single mother uh that horrible
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
conversation I had to have with her
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
about how how she was going to get
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
through this and basically be her
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
financial adviser which is not a job I
 
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
signed up for but happy to
 
01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
help that's going to happen across the
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire if you give
 
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
benefits directly to employees that's
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
going to happen again and again and
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
again and then we're going to be back
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
here in 2 years having some conversation
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
about how we fix that problem so let's
 
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
just not have that problem that's my
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
point anys represent of Pat thank you
 
01:25:09.199 --> 01:25:11.109 align:start position:0%
point anys represent of Pat thank you
can

01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:25:11.119 --> 01:25:12.870 align:start position:0%
can
um

01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:15.639 align:start position:0%
so if we do this through the
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
employer one of the things I'm trying to
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
Grapple with here is how we ensure that
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's predictable for the provider
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
um and what I'm hearing is sort of a pay
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
as you go from whoever's administering
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
like the receipts come in and then they
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
get they get be they get
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursed I'm I'm hearing you about why
 
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
you think it makes sense for it to FL
 
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
flow through through the
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
provider my concern is I'm hearing a lot
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
directly from providers about how
 
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
they're already feeling stress around
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
being able to access funding that has
 
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
been promised and feeling yanked around
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm trying to understand in in
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
this model that you're
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
envisioning when do they get the money
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know could we at least you know
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
provide it upfront to the to the
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
provider and then draw it down because
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
what my fear is sort of there's there's
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
so much
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:22.750 align:start position:0%
so much
ageta

01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
ageta
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
around being able to plan you know to be
 
01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
able to understand that the that the
 
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
employees will get these benefits so I
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm keeping an open mind on how we
 
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
best administer this and how the funds
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
flow but I want to make sure that the
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
provider is able to say you know with
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
confidence to their employee your
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
tuition assistance is covered or what
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
whatever the decision may be right so I
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm keeping an open mind but I just
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
want to put that out there as a worry
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
that I have as we're moving in that
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
direction yeah I totally agree with that
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
I mean represent like what do you do how
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
do you distribute this money right
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to get to
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
September and it runs out of cash right
 
01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
um which is why I said kind of at the
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
beginning like if I was if I was the
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
financial God of this program I would
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
take the amount of money that was given
 
01:27:15.149 --> 01:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
I would divid up by you know current
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
enrollment on X date probably for me
 
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
would be Jan one right and I would say
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
you have as the employer you you know
 
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
employer of you know you know Little
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
Learners has access to you know 15500
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know $15,000 to provide employee
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
benefits across the following benefit
 
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
allocations right um and as an employer
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
you know that that fund is available um
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
and then we just have to deal with what
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
happens with unexpended funds at the end
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
of the year but knowing employee
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
employers as I do um my guess is that
 
01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
fund would be damn near zero U if you if
 
01:27:50.189 --> 01:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
you knew that they could go and pull x
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars and they knew that
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
number uh very early on in the um very
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
early on in in the uh fiscal calendar
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
year I just um I I'm Maran ber from the
 
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory Council and we've
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
done a lot of research on this um Maine
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
right now does direct bonuses to the
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
staff people to the teachers and it has
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
helped with retention it's it goes
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
through their DHHS it's a quarterly
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
bonus Sy or a monthly bonus system I'm
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
sorry and it's just checks that go out
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
without any attachment of how that has
 
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
to be spent they assume they're spending
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
it for housing or they food or whatever
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
so I understand that's not exactly the
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way of doing it but the
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory council is truly
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
worried about child care Without Borders
 
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
right so if you leave me if I run a
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
childcare facility in conquered if you
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
leave my child care facility I want you
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
to stay in the field and go to your
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
child care facility or Lynn's child care
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
facility and what happens with the DHHS
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
grants say we just do not have the level
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
of participation that we would like to
 
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
see primarily because it does does go
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
through these really really overstressed
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
directors and owners of the business the
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
core Grant has been sort of a disaster
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
and um because there were a lot of guard
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
rails around it they it required
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
insurance levels that U family child
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
care providers do not have so they were
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
not able to benefit from it and
 
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
documentation without knowing the amount
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
that you're going to get back so we have
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
people who've been turning in 300 pages
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
of documentation of expenses and they
 
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
don't know whether they're going to get
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
back $50 or 50,000
 
01:29:24.669 --> 01:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
and so that is a real Challenge and a
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
huge paperwork burden I've we've also
 
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
heard from um business owners that they
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
do not want any sort of financial burden
 
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
of this they don't want to have to count
 
01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
these funds as income and if they do
 
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
count them as income there has to be
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
some sort of mechanism where they can
 
01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
save out some to cover their expenses
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
and how we best work that so I agree
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
with you that um it's a tremendous
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
burden to ask people to understand their
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
taxes and it's frustrating and it might
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
really hurt people um but it seems to be
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
the systems that worked best across the
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
country but it's but if it's not the New
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way that's fine I just want to
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that people stay in the field
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of what business they are at
 
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
and regardless of whether they move to
 
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
another town please don't go to work at
 
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts please stay in child care
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
and open up a child care facility in
 
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
that town Fran thank you um I was just
 
01:30:17.229 --> 01:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
wondering do you know for
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
Maine is it too simplistic to say can we
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
write something in the bill to say this
 
01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
money would be taxfree so you don't have
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
to worry about it you know no they they
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
have a tax problem they have a tax
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
problem or or taking it out okay yeah um
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
and it is a problem representative
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
Barry's right it's a problem and the
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
first year that they did it it's not a
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
problem for everybody because most
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
childcare providers are really broke I
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
mean it's not we're not talking a lot of
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
ton of money here but for married
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
providers it was an issue and so I think
 
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
that we acknowledge there's going to
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
have to be an education piece that's
 
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
pretty extraordinary that goes with us
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
and regardless of whether it goes
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
through the employer or goes through the
 
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
um goes straight to the teacher
 
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
themselves there's going to have to be
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
an educational piece to this because
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
right now and Jesse probably knows this
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit better than I do but um I
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
believe the most amount of people we've
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
had apply for a grant in grant funding
 
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
in the state is around 450 I don't think
 
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
we've broken 500 yet and we have 750
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
provid licensed providers in the state
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
so what's going on what's going on with
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
this 250 that they're not applying for
 
01:31:21.149 --> 01:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
funds some of it might be philosophical
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
some of them might be very wealthy and
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
they don't need to I would find that
 
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
surprising but I would worry an awful
 
01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
lot about those staff not being able to
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
access what's going to keep them in the
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
field yes so I hear all that but it's
 
01:31:35.629 --> 01:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
you know if you have a we not I don't
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
believe use as a grant right um you're
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
effectively setting up a revolving fund
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
that once I know how politics Works once
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
money is allocated into that thing the
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
likelihood that it's ever going to go
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
down is very low um because who's going
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
to be the politician that's going to
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
raise their hand and say yep I'm
 
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
draining the child care fund um so I I
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
live in that reality of I know how
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
politics Works um once the money goes
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
into that you can make the argument it
 
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
would never go up that's definitely
 
01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
possible um but you can never make the
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
argument to me that it would go down um
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
the having it be a set a set amount per
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
employer from the beginning and DHHS can
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
send out hey we've calculated this up uh
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
we believe you're eligible for X all
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
right and if it's worth the employer's
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
time which if it's you know a $20
 
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
million fund it definitely will be um I
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
can promise you they're going to apply
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
the the issue is the the current you
 
01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
know everybody wants to reference the
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
current Grant applications I have filled
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
out the current Grant applications so I
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
know about them right they are insane
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
right it's all like all right I've got
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
this teacher in this room making this
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
much money uh with this ratio um it's
 
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
nuts like it takes a long time that's
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you right now I haven't talked
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
to as many chocolate as you have that's
 
01:32:47.109 --> 01:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
why you don't have 200 people filling
 
01:32:48.109 --> 01:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
out because you load the thing up and
 
01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
it's insane that being said I don't
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
think this is like that we're not asking
 
01:32:53.709 --> 01:32:53.719 align:start position:0%
them to
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
produce why would we be asking them to
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
produce ratios in rooms at times of days
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that why why would we
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
asking that it's like hey uh show me
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
what you sent to Harvard
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim okay cool click here you go
 
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
right um I think we're way over
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
complicating I think we're taking the
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
the two existing grants that are out
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
there which are admittedly I haven't
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
even filled out the second one yet
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
because I keep loading it up and going
 
01:33:20.669 --> 01:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
oh my god um I think it's due the 23rd
 
01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
right I've got some
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
um see I know I know that's how you know
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at um I don't make this
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
stuff up I swear I live in this world um
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
but we're not I don't think I don't
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
think we're talking about that I don't
 
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
see why DHHS would be interested in that
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
um it's not the benefit that we're
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
looking to provide um arguably the one
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
thing you'd have to provide is a copy of
 
01:33:41.159 --> 01:33:42.629 align:start position:0%
thing you'd have to provide is a copy of
your

01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
payroll okay I could pull that off my
 
01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
phone right now um I I think it's I
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
think we're taking our experiences with
 
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
the current Grant application that's
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
closed and the current one that's open
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
till the 23rd we're applying that to
 
01:33:57.109 --> 01:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't yet exist and
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm telling you is they don't have
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
to be like that it doesn't you don't
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
have to live in that world you can live
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
in a world in which an employer files
 
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement um there's plenty of
 
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
software out there by the way uh I I do
 
01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
imagine DHHS would need a staffer for
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
this somebody to sit there God bless
 
01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
that person all day is going to be
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
looking at receipts but
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
um there somebody will do it I promise
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
you um I don't I I think we're making it
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
I think in the attempt to get the money
 
01:34:25.629 --> 01:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
directly there right and setting up
 
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
problems for the providers I think we're
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
overlooking what is the obvious Avenue
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
that I think will actually deliver the
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
most good I I think more employers will
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it than providers I
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
could see providers getting to the end
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the year and be like I forgot to file
 
01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.109 align:start position:0%
of the year and be like I forgot to file
H

01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
H
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
whatever I can see I can see that
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
happening like dealing with them every
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
day I could see that happening I don't
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
want that to happen to them I want them
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
to have the benefits right I want them
 
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
to get this stuff I want the employers
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
to provide better Ben benefits because
 
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
they know at the beginning of the year
 
01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to have this financial
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
stability from the state and that they
 
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
can then feel comfortable providing
 
01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
those benefits that's going to lift the
 
01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
industry up as a whole right not just
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know saying all right like you know
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to set this thing up and
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
have this Mass education system for you
 
01:35:08.189 --> 01:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
know how many child provide how many
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
childcare teachers are there in the
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire right there
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
thousands right thousand 5,500 so you're
 
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
talking about educating 5,500 people or
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
educating 700 business owners what do
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
you think is going to be the more uous
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
task right who do you think's more
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
likely to participate like let's just be
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
real right I I I love these teachers I
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
really do like I I i' really do love
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
them I want what's best for them I want
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
to get them what's best for them I don't
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
believe going directly to them is
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
actually the best way to do it it's use
 
01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
the system that already exists use the
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
department I sounds like we're good on
 
01:35:43.709 --> 01:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
the department but use the department
 
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
that the is already handling the
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
childcare centers to begin with um and
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
it just it all it all makes sense any so
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stop beating this today
 
01:35:53.470 --> 01:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
death um that those are my thoughts on
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
it I'd like to hear from the other side
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
of the aisle on it if we can come to
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
consensus then we can file this thing
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
off to OS and maybe vote on it this
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
afternoon so um I was wondering as you
 
01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
were talking I was wondering if there
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
was some way of writing this so that we
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
make it tighten it up so that this is a
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
pass through directly to the
 
01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
employees directly to the teachers
 
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
through the employer if that's the
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
preference but it has to go there has to
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
be directly to the teachers um and
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
without without all the receipts and
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
everything from the teachers but it goes
 
01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
directly as a bonus program directly as
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
a bonus program um to the teachers and
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
they can use it however they deem if
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
they have to use it on housing or
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
groceries or whatever it is well at that
 
01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
point you're just talking about
 
01:36:50.109 --> 01:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
supplemental pay right yes um that's
 
01:36:52.350 --> 01:36:52.360 align:start position:0%
that's what you you just that's what
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
they need um the point right let's get
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
we're it makes so the benefit side of it
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
if you if you give them pay right now
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
the employers incurred a tax liability
 
01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
but to be fair their employees getting a
 
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
benefit um so you're asking the
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
employers to eat a little bit of that I
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
imagine they would claw back somewhere
 
01:37:19.149 --> 01:37:19.159 align:start position:0%
else um benefits are you can write as
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
the employer you can write them off
 
01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:21.990 align:start position:0%
the employer you can write them off
right

01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
um so like my I already give my
 
01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
employees PTO it it means nothing to me
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
that that like the state coming in doing
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't do anything for me I
 
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
already give it to them um but you know
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
it would be great for me to be able to
 
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
lower their healthare costs because
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
right now I can only cover about $50 a
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
week per employee of their side of the
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
premium um like it'd be nice for me I
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
think more I think more of my employees
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
would take advantage of it um because I
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
do offer a very
 
01:37:48.109 --> 01:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
nice healthcare plan I I I'll give an
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
example my child spent 8 days in the niq
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
we had 116,000 Bill we were on the same
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
plan as our employers the total
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
liability for for me was
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
$234 why because I employ a lot of women
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
under the age of 30 so when I set up
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
that insurance you can imagine I moved
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
maternity and nursing care all the way
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
up because a lot of my teachers they are
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
of that age they get pregnant they have
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
children I want I wanted that service
 
01:38:12.669 --> 01:38:12.679 align:start position:0%
available to them I wasn't aware that my
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
wife would be the first one to take
 
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of it um but you know that's
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
that's how most employers would view
 
01:38:20.189 --> 01:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
this if you give them that opportunity I
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
believe they'll do the right thing
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
um I think just handing down the money
 
01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
might be too big of a pill to swallow
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
for my side um you're already asking us
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
to kind of move off of like because the
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
default answer from the Republican side
 
01:38:34.109 --> 01:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
of this would just be no we're
 
01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
establishing a program to give out money
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
the default answer is no we're trying to
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
work in good faith on that and I think
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
that might be a bridge too far for us so
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
to okay so are we going to be able to
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
reach any consensus on this like like
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
where are we at you kind of know I think
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
I've I've beaten this microphone to
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
death um trying to make this work so
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
like where are we at what can we agree
 
01:38:58.589 --> 01:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
to M Williams this is your bill let's
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
start off uh thank you chair Barry um it
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
seems like there are some points that we
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
can definitely work together on this
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill um and I think that in the
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
interests of getting the fund set up I
 
01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
think it's okay to put something on
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
paper to get the fund set up and if we
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
have to do future legislation in a year
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
or two or three like we do on so many
 
01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
we may have to do that but I think the
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
priority here is making sure that we can
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
at least create the fund um with the
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
intent that we are benefiting Child Care
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
employees for Recruitment and Retention
 
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
because that's the need right now um and
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
I think that need will continue um
 
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
because of the economics of child care
 
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and around the the
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
United States um so setting up the fund
 
01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
I think is the priority um that being
 
01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
said I think a lot of the things that
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
we've discussed are um are pretty easy
 
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
to put in as an Amendment uh but I what
 
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do is do a committee wide
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment if we can come to a consensus
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm talk yeah I I don't want
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
to just do a McWilliams Amendment on
 
01:40:01.709 --> 01:40:01.719 align:start position:0%
this obviously I don't think it's going
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
to go anywhere and the MC Williams
 
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment would look different than the
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment so we just be clear
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh but I think that that there's a
 
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
there's a way for us to find um a middle
 
01:40:13.709 --> 01:40:13.719 align:start position:0%
ground to get this rolling and
 
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that this needs to go to
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
finance next so they will iron out some
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
of those um nuanced questions that I
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
don't think this committee should be
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
spending time on in terms of like uh you
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
talked about the uh enrollment
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
proportionality I I think that's
 
01:40:29.589 --> 01:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
probably a finance discussion not an us
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
discussion which is okay uh but so in
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
the interest of of at least you know if
 
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
if we need to go through employers
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
because they're only 700ish employers
 
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
rather than employees because there are
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
5,500 okay let's set it up that way um I
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
do want to be very cautious about that
 
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
because as you mentioned there's a
 
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of businesses that
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
just don't apply for Grants so that
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
could leave those employees high and dry
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
because they're they know they're
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for their health insurance to
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
get covered and they may even submit
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
that to the employer and then the
 
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
employer sits on it so there's an
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
unfairness piece that maybe needs a
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of a I don't know a way to
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
work with that but okay and maybe the
 
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
unfairness is those employees end up
 
01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
leaving those employers but with child
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
care but with child care it's so
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
geographically based you know if this is
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
a Coos employer and there's only two of
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
them then it's not like those employees
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
can just uproot and go elsewhere so
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
they'd like to walk with their feet they
 
01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
probably will leave the industry rather
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
than forcing their employer or going
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
around the employer to apply for the
 
01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
grant themselves but In fairness and I'm
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
a middle child so fairness is very
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
important so In fairness I think that we
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
want to have some kind of a back door to
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
allow employees whose employers don't
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
apply to at least try because if you're
 
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
stuck geographically you're really stuck
 
01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
and that's not fair yeah actually I I
 
01:41:54.669 --> 01:41:54.679 align:start position:0%
think I can agree to that if the
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
employer doesn't apply I think I can
 
01:41:59.589 --> 01:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
agree to that because that that the free
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
market side of me says they would move
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
but you are right in Coos County there's
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
probably like three providers uh and
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
that may not be an option for them um so
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
I I'm willing to I'm willing to to meet
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
you on that okay all right I I think we
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
can make this work I think that we have
 
01:42:15.589 --> 01:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
enough common ground that we can set up
 
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
this fund and um certainly finance will
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
have more edits to this so we can submit
 
01:42:23.589 --> 01:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
what we've got in terms of the Common
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
Ground um I I'm open to any other
 
01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:27.639 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
this um so we're good on striking
 
01:42:32.109 --> 01:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
student loan payment and putting that
 
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
into C changing that to CTE or
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
continuing education costs sorry job
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
related education
 
01:42:37.679 --> 01:42:39.669 align:start position:0%
related education
exp

01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
exp
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh oh yeah well it is yeah then Dam we
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
could just get rid of it then job
 
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
related education expenses so we have so
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
we have the CTE that we want and we
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
won't do the student loan repayment it's
 
01:42:50.189 --> 01:42:50.199 align:start position:0%
just not going to happen are we cool
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
putting the T medicine coverage up into
 
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
F I know that that's that that's like
 
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
purely just like put it right where that
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
belongs um and then I assume we're good
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
with DHHS yep right uh and we're good
 
01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.070 align:start position:0%
with DHHS yep right uh and we're good
with

01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
striking uh uh Part B of section 4 for
 
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
preference which I guess we're going to
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
have to figure out how to do that with
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:21.310 align:start position:0%
 
know

01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
oh yes that's very important yes we need
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
to put rules in there um I have that
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
underline right on the top of it
 
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
rules DHHS will promate rules um and
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
then um okay y all right so uh mck uh
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
repres MC Williams you want to submit
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
that Amendment put my put me on it with
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
you um if we're lucky we'll get we'll
 
01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
get it back from OS
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
today can I how many can I put on it can
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
I put the whole committee on it yeah you
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
if if if they're agreable to it let's
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
put everyone on it I agree yeah let's
 
01:44:00.189 --> 01:44:00.199 align:start position:0%
put everyone on it all right is
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
everybody is everybody everybody good
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right all right so with
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
that we're going to end the snap
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
executive session and go back to public
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
hearings and we're only oh God an hour
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
and a half behind but hey you know all
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
right all right moving on uh we're going
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
to open up the public hearing on House
 
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 1056 relative to the administration
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
of the scholarship program which I
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
believe representative D Simone you are
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah just go ahead and introduce it
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple bill um so you guys
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
know uh represented D Simon and I work
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
together on a lot of these bills um but
 
01:44:44.669 --> 01:44:44.679 align:start position:0%
we put her as the lead because if she
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
test if I was the if I am the chair and
 
01:44:48.669 --> 01:44:48.679 align:start position:0%
I get up and I I advocate for the bill
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
eye then it can no longer participate in
 
01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:52.719 align:start position:0%
the hearing um so there I told her I
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
would take the ones that were a little
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
spicier um and I would give her the ones
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
that I thought were probably more
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
consensus driven so all right thank you
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%

01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
lunch that's for sh hello I'm Jesse
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
Davis I'm the bureau chief um of Child
 
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
Development and Head Start collaboration
 
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
for the department and um I just want to
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
caution the committee that this would
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
put us in out of compliance with Federal
 
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
Regulation we cannot discriminate
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
against a certain type of family for
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
fund okay questions from the committee
 
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
represent MC Williams do you have a
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation for how we could get
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
I unfortunately did not come come
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
prepared for a recommendation of a
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
workaround um I do know that also um
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
there is no waiting period you can
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
reapply at any time
 
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
so cool um do you believe we passes the
 
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
that's my favorite question to always
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
ask because the feds like to give money
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
and then put a bunch of strings on it
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
and I like to call their Bluff do you
 
01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
believe they would actually take away
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
our child care scholarship if we
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize the applications of childcare
 
01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:21.350 align:start position:0%
prioritize the applications of childcare
workers

01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
I know that they could I know the answer
 
01:47:24.589 --> 01:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
is they could my question is is would
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
they we would have Federal findings for
 
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
this yes and we would have to have
 
01:47:31.390 --> 01:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
correction corrective action plan and we
 
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
would have to yes it would it yes it
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
would put us at
 
01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.229 align:start position:0%
would put us at
risk

01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
represent um is there any kind of
 
01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
prioritization that currently happens
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
like first come first served or how are
 
01:47:49.589 --> 01:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
they prioritized currently it is based
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
on the amount of funds that we have
 
01:47:54.189 --> 01:47:54.199 align:start position:0%
available and who is applying so yes you
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
would get to a waiting period if you
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
have more families who are eligible so
 
01:48:01.709 --> 01:48:01.719 align:start position:0%
the answer to that would be yes first
 
01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
come first serve okay further questions
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
from the committee all right seeing none
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%

in the South End um here to introduce
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1405 relative to limiting the
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
publication of chalk care violations so
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
this comes uh at the request of our
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
friend Kora from Rochester uh she
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
testified about this about how her
 
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
insurance rates doubled um due to the
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
publications of findings that were not
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
in her I wish she was here um but to her
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
to her statement uh were not material to
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
the safety or well-being of a child um
 
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
the basically the insurance company this
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
is what she says the insurance company
 
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
went in pulled her file um she has what
 
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
she says was paperwork violations um and
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
they Ed that as the impetus to double
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
her insurance bill um so I told her when
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
I was talking to her outside of our
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
listening session uh in Conway um that
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh I would do something about it and
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
this is what I did um so I'm sure it
 
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
will need to be worked on I'm sure ghhs
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
will have um some things to say about it
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
and some things about why we can or
 
01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
cannot do certain things um but I want
 
01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
everyone to know this this comes
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
directly from our public hearings this
 
01:50:59.069 --> 01:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
comes directly from one of our providers
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
um it is a problem that I looked at and
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
I said there's a way to do this we don't
 
01:51:06.589 --> 01:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
want to not publish the findings of
 
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:08.679 align:start position:0%
safety violations right so if you're not
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
being safe right not covering that up
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies by the way have a
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
right to know that um if we're dinging
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
somebody because they don't have
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
paperwork right and then their costs for
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
insurance are doubling which is what are
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
claiming um that's a problem I believe
 
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
the state can solve um so with that um
 
01:51:28.109 --> 01:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the I'm sure the bill will need
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
tons of work but I'm interested to hear
 
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
people say and I'm actually going to go
 
01:51:32.910 --> 01:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
and get a glass of water so I'll see
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
what's up and I'll fill out the pink
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
card do we have any more pink cards on
 
01:51:38.079 --> 01:51:40.310 align:start position:0%
card do we have any more pink cards on
this

01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
do thank you m representative Barry um
 
01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%

01:52:07.239 --> 01:52:10.669 align:start position:0%
 
over

01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.709 --> 01:52:13.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you for coming forward the
 
01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
floor is yours thank you madam chair and
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
01:52:19.229 --> 01:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
Melissa Clement and I am the chief of
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
the childcare life sensing unit for the
 
01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:23.639 align:start position:0%
Department of DHHS I'm Jesse Davis
 
01:52:25.069 --> 01:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
bureau chief of Child Development and
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
Head Start
 
01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
collaboration um so we fully understand
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the providers regarding
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
this bill it's come to our attention
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies are using
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
findings that are made by the department
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
in order to either drop insurance or
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
change insurance and while we we
 
01:52:46.589 --> 01:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
completely understand that at the same
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
time we have a responsibility to when we
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
monitor programs on their that we have
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
to post these online and in addition to
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
what we Post online the um Jesse will
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
speak more to the requirements under the
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
child care Development Fund regarding
 
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
that it cannot be a summary it has to
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
show what we saw during the inspection
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
what was in compliance and what was not
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
in compliance so we have shifted our
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
system so that we're not only showing
 
01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:15.560 align:start position:0%
what the citations were but we're also
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
showing what they were in compliance
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
because that is a federal requirement if
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
we move forward with something like this
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
it would require changes to the systems
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
that we have in place um we put together
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note worksheet that you should
 
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
have received I believe you have it and
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
based on previous assessments we
 
01:53:36.589 --> 01:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't get a quote specifically for
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
this one item but when we've made system
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
changes in the past for similar
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
situations it could cost as low as
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
$78,000 or as much as $500,000 depending
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
on the amount of um changes that we have
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
to make in our system in addition to
 
01:53:54.510 --> 01:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
that um the impact would be to the child
 
01:53:56.669 --> 01:53:56.679 align:start position:0%
care Development Fund and I'll let Jesse
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
speak yeah so there is a federal
 
01:54:01.629 --> 01:54:01.639 align:start position:0%
requirement that we must post both
 
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
compliance and non-compliance for all
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
monitoring visits and so for all Child
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
Care scholarship eligible programs this
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
would put them out of compliance and
 
01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
compliance thank you for your testimon
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
will you take questions absolutely thank
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
you Williams thank you representative
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chair um similar
 
01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
question do you have recommendations for
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
resolved I um I come to New Hampshire
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
new um and I come from the state of
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
Idaho and in the state of Idaho they do
 
01:54:47.229 --> 01:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
allow programs to correct those findings
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
and then they republish those findings
 
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
that could potentially be a way to
 
01:54:57.069 --> 01:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
support the Child Care community and
 
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
that they've corrected the violation and
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
our current as Jesse mentioned being new
 
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
so our current process here is we find a
 
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
citation the program um writes a
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan and then the
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
department accepts that corrective
 
01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:13.719 align:start position:0%
action plan and ensures you know the
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
items were corrected and then they're
 
01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:16.350 align:start position:0%
items were corrected and then they're
posted

01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
posted
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
online so that's the process we have
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
currently and then we go out and monitor
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
again so the insurance companies can see
 
01:55:25.950 --> 01:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
that there's a three-year history of
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
what the program has had for citations
 
01:55:30.669 --> 01:55:30.679 align:start position:0%
for the last three
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
years thank you for your question
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative wner yes could you just
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
talk a minute I thought I heard you say
 
01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
you do both things that are
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
non-compliant and compliant so I mean I
 
01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
would assume that almost all of the
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
reports would be extremely long with all
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
everything that's in compliance so how
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
do you how do you do how do you um show
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
that on the sure so I can certainly send
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
the committee a link to our most recent
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
the current system that we're using and
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we've grouped like items
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
together so there's certain what is
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
called domains such as one will be
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
records one will be care of children one
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
is medication so in each of those
 
01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
domains it's like a drop down so there's
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
a little icon that shows what in
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
compliance and what's not in compliance
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a number so it shows the
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
number of items that were reviewed at
 
01:56:25.870 --> 01:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
the visit and then the number of items
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
that were in compliance as like a quick
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
view and then we also post our what you
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
would normally see as a statement of
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
findings which just shows the citations
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
and their corrective action plan but
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's all together now it looks
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
completely different than what you've
 
01:56:40.750 --> 01:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
probably seen in the
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
past I would could I have a followup I
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
just wondered when did you start using
 
01:56:49.470 --> 01:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
that system um it was last summer so Ju
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:22.390 align:start position:0%
 
time

01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can we please have the blue
 
01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:47.189 align:start position:0%
 
1405

01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
1405
 
01:57:49.069 --> 01:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you very much and I'm
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
sorry um I forgot to mention this thank
 
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
you Dorene manager for reminding me um
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
when we became aware of this issue with
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
the um the insurance companies
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
cancelling and changing it we did reach
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
out to the commissioner of the insurance
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
department and he did join a meeting at
 
01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know if childcare advisory
 
01:58:08.589 --> 01:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
Council or early learning New Hampshire
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
one of those so that he could speak
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
directly so that we can hopefully go
 
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
from that angle and make sure that the
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
insurance dep department has a better
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of our process and what we
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
do so that this doesn't continue to
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
occur so we're also working it from that
 
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
angle as well and thank you for allowing
 
01:58:26.669 --> 01:58:26.679 align:start position:0%
me to come back sure thank you for the
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair um do you think
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
that this is something that can be
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
resolved just with conversations or do
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
you think it's something that maybe we
 
01:58:40.589 --> 01:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
would need to pursue from you know
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
telling insurance companies sorry you
 
01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
can't change um I mean that's what
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
that's a conversation that we're having
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner over at the
 
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department is to determine
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
what other avenues that we can take for
 
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
this so that it doesn't impact child
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
care providers it's um childcare
 
01:58:58.589 --> 01:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
providers child daycare and also child
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
residential providers all these
 
01:59:03.629 --> 01:59:03.639 align:start position:0%
providers are being hit with insurance
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
costs that are skyrocketing or being
 
01:59:11.709 --> 01:59:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
further seeing no one thank you very
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much for give me
 
01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.069 --> 01:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
time I do see on the blue sheet three
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
people signed up some of them did
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
testify um they on the blue sheet they
 
01:59:34.069 --> 01:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
did not disclose whether they were Pro
 
01:59:34.079 --> 01:59:41.830 align:start position:0%
did not disclose whether they were Pro
or

01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
con with that I'll close the uh hearing
 
01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
1405 and take a twom minute recess to
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.159 --> 02:01:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
back

02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:19.229 --> 02:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh sorry about that y'all
 
02:01:20.430 --> 02:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
just kind of hanging outside drinking a
 
02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
diet coke
 
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
um the uh okay uh so we just did that
 
02:01:28.069 --> 02:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
one bill
 
02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
um uh no let me take the slings and
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
arrows on this one um because this is
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
going to be the one that's going to be
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
the contentious one uh I'll fill out a
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
card for you here's that
 
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
one I'll wait for you to recognize me
 
02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:46.870 align:start position:0%
one I'll wait for you to recognize me
Madam

02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
Sher follow the rules
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
follower okay I will now open the
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
1407 I will recognize representative
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
Barry from Hillsboro
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
39 y thank you representative bar
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you madam chairman um my
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
name is representative Ross Barry I
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro 39 Manchester 689
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
the fighting South End um it's for all
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
my Manchester people um so uh what we
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
have here 1407 is modifies the child
 
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
care uh the teacher to staff ratios so I
 
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
know this is going to be outside of
 
02:02:31.709 --> 02:02:31.719 align:start position:0%
maybe the bill we did earlier this
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
morning this might be the other super
 
02:02:36.069 --> 02:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
contentious thing that we have a
 
02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on um in
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
my we all acknowledge we're in a crisis
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
I we don't need to go over that there is
 
02:02:47.709 --> 02:02:47.719 align:start position:0%
one thing that the state can do
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
literally today that would increase
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
access and affordability and that is to
 
02:02:55.470 --> 02:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
allow more children in the classroom the
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
question for the committee the question
 
02:03:00.030 --> 02:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
for the state is what detriment is that
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
to quality and safety right so instead
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
of doing a wholesale increase right so
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
instead of taking one to four and moving
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
it to 1 to five I try to preemptively
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
find a middle ground that wouldn't cause
 
02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
people to overreact and have an actual
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
actual honest conversation about this so
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
let's talk about infant care since
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's actually where the biggest crunch
 
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
is right the reason infant care by the
 
02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
way has the biggest crunch in the state
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
is it has the however you want to look
 
02:03:34.069 --> 02:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
at it highest or lowest ratio um it's
 
02:03:36.030 --> 02:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
technically the highest but um
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
mathematically it's the highest but we
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
would prefer just the lowest uh the
 
02:03:42.910 --> 02:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
lowest ratio of a four four infants four
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
children on the age of one to one
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
teacher in the
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
classroom no child care center can make
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
a profit off of that that is entirely a
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
break even um Venture the only way to
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
make a profit off the average infant
 
02:03:58.109 --> 02:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
care I think it's north of $300 a week
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
at this point um you're talking about
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
$155,000 a year per infant right it is
 
02:04:05.310 --> 02:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
the most expensive part of the child
 
02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:06.189 align:start position:0%
the most expensive part of the child
care

02:04:06.189 --> 02:04:06.199 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:04:09.069 --> 02:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
cycle so I've been in the infant room um
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
it's the toughest definitely by the way
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
I think it's the toughest room they say
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
the two-year-olds the toughest but I
 
02:04:14.669 --> 02:04:14.679 align:start position:0%
actually think the infants are the
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
toughest because they they're either all
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
asleep or they're all needy at once um
 
02:04:20.430 --> 02:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
and when they when the infant needs
 
02:04:23.069 --> 02:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
attention the infant needs attention um
 
02:04:25.709 --> 02:04:25.719 align:start position:0%
so the the issue is is I didn't take it
 
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
from 1 to five I didn't I'm not saying
 
02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to just increase it 20% on
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
one teacher that's a lot uh five infants
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
to one teacher is a lot some by the way
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
some states do that um I don't know if
 
02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for New Hampshire to do
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
that so what I said was if there's a
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
second teacher in the room instead of
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
having a 2 to8 ratio you can go to 2 to9
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
right so instead of a 20% a 20 a 25%
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
increase we're talking about a 122%
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
increase um the things I don't like
 
02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
about this um I don't like that it's not
 
02:04:58.990 --> 02:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
going to apply to every Childcare Center
 
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
right if your room is not licensed to
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
hold over over eight right it doesn't
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
matter that your ratio is 2 to n now um
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
if the fire code says you can't have
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
more than eight in that room it doesn't
 
02:05:13.549 --> 02:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
matter that your ratio says 2 to n now
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
um but the question and I hope the
 
02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
committee and I hope those in in
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
presence will have an honest
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
conversation about is we talk about the
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
ways to provide increased access
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
increased affordability and the answer
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
is always the same you know from people
 
02:05:29.310 --> 02:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
it's like let's throw more money at the
 
02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
problem and see if it goes away and we
 
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
just had a long conversation about that
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm open to that conversation
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
in my heart of hearts I don't believe it
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
solves the long-term problems the way to
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
create relief today is to take the
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
existing spaces that we have where we
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
can safely do it and expand it today
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's the way to fix it today right
 
02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean by the way the problem
 
02:05:54.549 --> 02:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
goes away it's a relief
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
valve but it's something that we need to
 
02:05:58.549 --> 02:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
have an open and honest conversation
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
about and it's it's something that I
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
hope that we don't just the cackles go
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
up and we say no um in case you're
 
02:06:05.069 --> 02:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
wondering where I got this idea from I
 
02:06:07.069 --> 02:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
actually got the idea from Massachusetts
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts to their credit they
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
start with a lower ratio to begin with
 
02:06:11.629 --> 02:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
so they start at 1 to three um and then
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
when they get that second child they go
 
02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
to basically two to seven um so the idea
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
came from them we started up higher them
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
to begin with um but I I knew that just
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
adding one to everyone would pretty much
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
be a non-starter quite honestly I don't
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
even know if it would be practical I
 
02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
don't even know if as a business owner I
 
02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
would put U even if I could I don't
 
02:06:31.549 --> 02:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
think I would put five infants on one
 
02:06:32.830 --> 02:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
teacher I don't actually don't think I
 
02:06:36.030 --> 02:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
would do that to my staff um but a lot
 
02:06:37.950 --> 02:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
of the centers already do what's called
 
02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
over enrolling right so if their room's
 
02:06:43.149 --> 02:06:43.159 align:start position:0%
licensed to eight they'll enroll to nine
 
02:06:45.629 --> 02:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
basically crossing their fingers that
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
one um one kid won't show up that day
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
day it's a very common practice they'll
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
bump a kid up they'll bump a kid down
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
right they'll make it work uh it's hard
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
on infants because you can't bump them
 
02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
down right there's there's just the
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
floor right they can't be younger than
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
six weeks um you know that happens on a
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
one-year-old room a two-year-old room
 
02:07:05.069 --> 02:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
and older you can move them up and down
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
a little bit provided everything's safe
 
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
Mom and Dad knows um your ratio is based
 
02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
on your average
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
age so you're there's there's ways in
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
those older rooms but in the infant room
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
specifically you're talking about you
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
when you start doing the math right um
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
there's no people are not making money
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
inant room this is not going to make
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
infant rooms suddenly super profitable
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
um but what I will hope it will do is I
 
02:07:30.910 --> 02:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
hope it will people that are looking at
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
their chalkra Center I hope that it will
 
02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
encourage them to expand that if it's an
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity um and we just need to have
 
02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
a good faith conversation about is that
 
02:07:44.669 --> 02:07:44.679 align:start position:0%
2 to9 ratio right is that significantly
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
worse than 2 to8 right cuz once again we
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
are not talking about 1: four going to 1
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
to five we're talking about 2 to8 going
 
02:07:53.870 --> 02:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
to 2 to9 um and with that I'm happy to
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for accepting
 
02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:05.069 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for accepting
questions

02:08:05.069 --> 02:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so I learn
 
02:08:08.830 --> 02:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
things every day in this role but uh I
 
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
my children attended a daycare and I
 
02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
think that they over enrolled because
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
they were bumping my children into the
 
02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
one's room sometime they spend a day so
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
now I know what happened but um so um I
 
02:08:20.910 --> 02:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
like this bill um and I just wanted to
 
02:08:23.069 --> 02:08:23.079 align:start position:0%
clarify that nothing will require a
 
02:08:25.069 --> 02:08:25.079 align:start position:0%
child care provider to even change their
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
ratios they just can if they're willing
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
and they have the staff and they think
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
they can take on whe whether it be for
 
02:08:31.549 --> 02:08:31.559 align:start position:0%
space or fire code this is something
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
that allows them to accept another child
 
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you correct so so none of the
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
other regulations change right if the
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
room is not because it's basically like
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
40 square foot per children um per child
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
um that's that none of that changes
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
right if your room can only hold eight
 
02:08:50.069 --> 02:08:50.079 align:start position:0%
you don't get to magically hold nine now
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
if your room so like my infant room is I
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
believe it's licensed up to 11: we will
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
never go to 11 because I need to get to
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
12 right to be I need to get to 12 to
 
02:09:01.069 --> 02:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
break even right so like I have this
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
three child extra capacity in my Center
 
02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
I'll never use it um right and I'm not
 
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
by the way I'm not advocating for that
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
um this thing this change only allows
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
for that first bump up so it's not like
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
you can start like putting in I've got
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
like six teachers in and now I can go
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
plus seven um it's plus one teacher plus
 
02:09:22.669 --> 02:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
one student one time cut off um and to
 
02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
that point I I reiterate you know if
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
every Childcare Center in the Capac in
 
02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
the state had a capacity to go to nine
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
in a room we would be immediately
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
increasing the access if every child
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
care center enrolled in this process we
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
would immediately be increasing the
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
access um 12 a half% for infant care um
 
02:09:43.589 --> 02:09:43.599 align:start position:0%
and market market economics will tell
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
you right as you increase Supply right
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
price comes down right um because we
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
know the Dem demand's there we don't
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
have to worry about the demand we know
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
the demand's there um but as you
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
increase Supply price will come down and
 
02:09:55.589 --> 02:09:55.599 align:start position:0%
the question we have to have go back to
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
it and we have to have a good faith
 
02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
conversation is is is this safe to what
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
level is it going to affect quality I'm
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
not going to sit up here and tell you
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
there will be no quality difference
 
02:10:05.310 --> 02:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
between a and N of course there will be
 
02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
a quality diminish of course there will
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
be right the question is is what is the
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
tradeoff of that what level of quality
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
is diminished I personally don't believe
 
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's very much but it'll be something um
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
versus what is the cost of having that
 
02:10:22.069 --> 02:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
parent not in the workforce or having
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
that child at home um we do know that a
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
child is more likely to get into an
 
02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
accident home they are in a Childcare
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
Center that's a fact right so these are
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
things that the committee needs to have
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
an honest conversation about um and I I
 
02:10:38.189 --> 02:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm for it I sponsored it um
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
but I I really want to emphasize like I
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
I hope that there's not the like you
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
know this is going to you know kids are
 
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
going to be in trouble like like let's
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
not have that let's not have the
 
02:10:49.069 --> 02:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
hysteria let's just have an actual
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
conversation about specifically for
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
infant care now this this is all levels
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
but specifically for infant care is that
 
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
12 and a half increase with that second
 
02:10:57.870 --> 02:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
teacher in the room that's secondhand
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
available to you is that going having
 
02:11:03.549 --> 02:11:03.559 align:start position:0%
that extra child in there with them is
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
that going to diminish the care versus
 
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
is it worth it to have whatever that
 
02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
diminished care is is it worth it to
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.159 --> 02:11:20.350 align:start position:0%
 
access

02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
followup I this may be standard RSA
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
stuff but this act shall take effect 60
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
days after its passage I love the
 
02:11:29.069 --> 02:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
immediacy of this as a solution is it
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
possible to have it take effect
 
02:11:32.549 --> 02:11:32.559 align:start position:0%
immediately after the governor
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
presumably signs it into law or is that
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
not possible I that's a question for
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
exec I would say yes um we kind of 60
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
days of standard stock language I will
 
02:11:42.549 --> 02:11:42.559 align:start position:0%
say the uh something to point out the
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
ratios are not currently in statute the
 
02:11:47.069 --> 02:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
ratios are currently in rule um so what
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
we what I did was I take for those
 
02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
who've ever followed me I'm a big fan of
 
02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
the legislator taking back the rul
 
02:11:56.709 --> 02:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
making Authority um like I know it's I'm
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
a big fan of that I think it's actually
 
02:12:00.189 --> 02:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
our job to do that as much as possible
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
so what I did was I took the existing
 
02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
rules and I just codify basically take
 
02:12:04.830 --> 02:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
our power back and codify it because we
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
give uh dhss the power to make rules but
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
ultimately we are the deciders of what
 
02:12:11.109 --> 02:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
happens uh and I got into a very heated
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
argument about that with representative
 
02:12:14.910 --> 02:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
Hill the other day um about we are we do
 
02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
actually get to make the
 
02:12:17.079 --> 02:12:20.830 align:start position:0%
actually get to make the
rules

02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Phillips good
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
questions good question from you too I'm
 
02:12:26.589 --> 02:12:26.599 align:start position:0%
sure representative
 
02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
crate thank you Sher thank you for
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question um it's actually is a
 
02:12:32.669 --> 02:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
little bit similar to a question that
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips asked earlier um
 
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to Sunset this
 
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
change um if we get to a point where uh
 
02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
with this and all of the other changes
 
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
that we're making to enhance child care
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
availability and and spots and
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
everything um so that it's not such a
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
emergency could we go back in 5 years or
 
02:12:56.669 --> 02:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
revisit this so I'm totally open to that
 
02:12:57.709 --> 02:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
and I actually thought about putting it
 
02:13:00.189 --> 02:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
in there to begin with um because it is
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
it is a it is something that would
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
normally fall underne the ru making
 
02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
Authority um but I'm I'm totally open to
 
02:13:08.069 --> 02:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
that um I would even be open to some
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
trigger right you know if and we can
 
02:13:12.189 --> 02:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
really get into the Weeds on it but you
 
02:13:13.589 --> 02:13:13.599 align:start position:0%
know if there's some survey that is
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
conducted because they they they conduct
 
02:13:18.030 --> 02:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
regular childcare surveys there's some
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
survey that conducted and it shows that
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
there's you know X number of openings
 
02:13:22.510 --> 02:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
then this this law shall Sunset
 
02:13:23.790 --> 02:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
immediately or something like that I'm
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Paige and
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
then back to you representative Phillips
 
02:13:37.510 --> 02:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I'm curious if
 
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
you talk directly to providers who want
 
02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
this increase um one of the
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
things so we I've seen two different
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
different surveys at this point looking
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
at this issue and in both cases it was
 
02:13:53.790 --> 02:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
clear that a majority of providers do
 
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
not want this change but also that
 
02:13:58.990 --> 02:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
there's like 30% or so of providers who
 
02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.589 align:start position:0%
there's like 30% or so of providers who
are

02:14:00.589 --> 02:14:00.599 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
interested something that's interesting
 
02:14:05.709 --> 02:14:05.719 align:start position:0%
to me is I haven't heard the voices of
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
that 30% directly and I don't know if
 
02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's because they know they're in the
 
02:14:11.069 --> 02:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
minority and they don't feel comfortable
 
02:14:13.149 --> 02:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
speaking up about it but I'm wondering
 
02:14:14.669 --> 02:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
if you as the
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor have heard directly from those
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
providers about why they want this
 
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
change about the impact on quality
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
um because if we're contemplating this I
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
really want to understand what those
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
what that Minority of providers is
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
hoping to achieve and how how they think
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
that they can do this without a
 
02:14:36.549 --> 02:14:36.559 align:start position:0%
meaningful compromise on quality that
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
will be a detriment to our kids and Care
 
02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so I definitely have spoken to
 
02:14:41.549 --> 02:14:41.559 align:start position:0%
providers who want the ratios increase
 
02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
there's some providers that want no no
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
ratios like we we ain't going we we
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to get there so like you know um
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
let's like let's not let's not be silly
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
um but I think when it comes to so when
 
02:14:54.270 --> 02:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
it comes to the Quality uh I will say as
 
02:14:55.470 --> 02:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
a provider myself a conversation I've
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
had with other providers the largest
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
concern like I'm not overly concerned
 
02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
about the diminished quality of the
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
child I'm worried about the staff um so
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
I asked I pulled my staff in the in the
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
childcare room I said hey uh what would
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
you think if I tossed a ninth kid in
 
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
here and they're like uh you know okay I
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
was like what what would what would you
 
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
think if I toss ninth kitten here and I
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
paid you $2 an hour more oh yes yeah
 
02:15:18.549 --> 02:15:18.559 align:start position:0%
yeah bring the ninth kitten um
 
02:15:22.350 --> 02:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it's you know I I I think you
 
02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
have to let the my greatest concern is
 
02:15:27.149 --> 02:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
that employer employee relationship
 
02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
right um I you know I I really view my
 
02:15:32.510 --> 02:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
employee I try to treat them like really
 
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
well like it's literally a part of my
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
business model I've talked about here my
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
my business model is uh very high
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
retention treat my employees very well
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
um right way easier like replacing
 
02:15:45.069 --> 02:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
replacing good employees it cost me like
 
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to do that I don't
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
even want to do it it's just I I want
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
them to stay forever I know they won't
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
but I want them to stay forever um so my
 
02:15:53.549 --> 02:15:53.559 align:start position:0%
largest concern would be a employer that
 
02:15:55.229 --> 02:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
opts into this would need to be very
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
wary of what sort of Burden are they
 
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
placing on the actual childcare employee
 
02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I would go back to they don't have to
 
02:16:04.549 --> 02:16:04.559 align:start position:0%
do it right um when I asked once again
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to when I asked my my
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
Center uh when I asked my teachers you
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
know they were like they weren't really
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
hot on the ninth kid and when I said I'd
 
02:16:12.629 --> 02:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
PID them more money they were like
 
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely bring them on in so you know
 
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's a conversation that
 
02:16:18.350 --> 02:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
employees employers need to have
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
um you know giving my staff in that room
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
a $2 raise and then adding in another
 
02:16:24.549 --> 02:16:24.559 align:start position:0%
kid um would allow me to actually lower
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
the overall cost for the rest of the
 
02:16:27.910 --> 02:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
parents um and I I would everybody would
 
02:16:29.310 --> 02:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
win the CH the cost for the parents
 
02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
would go down I would make more money my
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
employer my employees would make more
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
money everybody's happy across the board
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
um but that's a decision that I would
 
02:16:39.070 --> 02:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
make as a business owner um the decision
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
that we have to make as a state is is it
 
02:16:43.589 --> 02:16:43.599 align:start position:0%
safe and to what level is it diminished
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
quality um personally I believe it is
 
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
safe obviously if I thought it was safe
 
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't even propose the idea I think
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
to your point about why more employe why
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
more people don't speak up about it is
 
02:16:56.589 --> 02:16:56.599 align:start position:0%
it it takes a level of bravery to say
 
02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
hey I think we can put more kids in this
 
02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
classroom because of the blowback you
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
know you're going to get um because you
 
02:17:05.429 --> 02:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
can see the accusations that are going
 
02:17:06.669 --> 02:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
to get pointed oh you don't care about
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
the kids you just want to make money
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
right no employee no no small business
 
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
owner wants to raise their hand and have
 
02:17:16.669 --> 02:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
that conversation um but I I assure you
 
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
it exists and I assure you looking at
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
the overall Market as a whole I'll go
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
back to if you want to create a relief
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
valve the the largest relief valve that
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
you can create for the existing problems
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
that we have in child care right is this
 
02:17:31.870 --> 02:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
it's the largest release of valve
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
because it's increased Revenue right
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
without increasing costs it is the only
 
02:17:40.669 --> 02:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
thing that you can do right um across
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
the board and we just have to have a an
 
02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
once again go back to an honest
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
conversation about is it safe is is the
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
diminish I'm not going to sit here in
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
lie and say that the care is going to be
 
02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
the same is the is the the amount that
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
the care will go down right is the
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
divided attention that it'll go down is
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
it worth the increase in Access and
 
02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:07.709 --> 02:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative Phillips thank you
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
again is there a state that you're
 
02:18:11.709 --> 02:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
modeling these ratios a after I know
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts you mentioned earlier
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
is actually more conservative and I'll
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
never say that again uh in their ratios
 
02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
so they do 3 to one so is there another
 
02:18:21.150 --> 02:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
state that's doing this at this level or
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
or more so there are states that have
 
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
higher ratios than this um their states
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
that historically we have not modeled
 
02:18:28.669 --> 02:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
ourselves after you know I think
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
Mississippi's in there um you know I I
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
looked at it I kind of looked at like
 
02:18:37.549 --> 02:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
where we were um where the state was and
 
02:18:39.509 --> 02:18:39.519 align:start position:0%
you know we are on probably kind of
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
already I wouldn't say we're in the high
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
end but we're probably above
 
02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:44.790 align:start position:0%
end but we're probably above
50%

02:18:44.790 --> 02:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
50%
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
um once again it's a question of do we
 
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
keep going up right to allow more kids
 
02:18:53.230 --> 02:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
in um because we know there's nothing
 
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
else that we're going to be able to do
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
today that would actually increase
 
02:19:00.030 --> 02:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
access um but no we're not like I
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I think I want to say there was
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
one state that had like one to six and I
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
was like even I was like jaw dropped on
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
that I'm like that's insane um but it's
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know I would never I I couldn't I
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
couldn't see a world in which we would
 
02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
go to one of six I wouldn't see I
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even recommend going to one to
 
02:19:15.549 --> 02:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
five uh Standalone teacher um but I do
 
02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
think 2 to nine um is acceptable um
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
because as I said earlier when the the
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
infants when they all for some reason
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
they all like they all go together like
 
02:19:25.389 --> 02:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
they're all asleep together or they're
 
02:19:27.629 --> 02:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
all they're all awake together doing
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
what the infants do um so it is a very
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
stressful room it's a very loud room um
 
02:19:35.309 --> 02:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
it takes a special special special
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
teacher to go into that room every day
 
02:19:40.110 --> 02:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
um you are dealing in literal human
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
feces on an Al I me you're doing you
 
02:19:43.549 --> 02:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
know you're doing all the things a mom
 
02:19:46.669 --> 02:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
does times four um for eight hours
 
02:19:49.389 --> 02:19:49.399 align:start position:0%
straight um God bless those people God
 
02:19:49.399 --> 02:19:53.710 align:start position:0%
straight um God bless those people God
bless

02:19:53.710 --> 02:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
them any further
 
02:20:02.429 --> 02:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
questions representative wner yes so I
 
02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill and all of these
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
ratios only deal with children under
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
three years old so we're not y you
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
didn't look at the preschool preschool
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
ratios correct I did not um and the what
 
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
reason being once again I know this is
 
02:20:20.550 --> 02:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
already a big pill to swallow um I from
 
02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
my from my conversations and our
 
02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
hearings there is not as big of a need
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
in those higher those higher rooms those
 
02:20:28.190 --> 02:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
rooms already have you know 12 to1
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
ratios right um once you get up there
 
02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
you have more access you definitely have
 
02:20:35.469 --> 02:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
more affordability I didn't believe it
 
02:20:37.389 --> 02:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
was necessary if you wanted to go all
 
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
the way up trust me the conservative in
 
02:20:40.990 --> 02:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
me would would would agree to that but I
 
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
I tried to start I tried to instead of
 
02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
trying to start the bill all the way to
 
02:20:47.070 --> 02:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
the right and work to the middle I just
 
02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
said I'm going to come with I what I
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
think is the actual middle right off the
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
bat um because I don't some somebody
 
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
will probably say I'm wrong I just don't
 
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
believe we need to change the ratios for
 
02:20:59.070 --> 02:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
the older kids right now because I just
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
don't see the level of Crisis there that
 
02:21:03.150 --> 02:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
I do for the under
 
02:21:05.389 --> 02:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
threes have a follow
 
02:21:08.830 --> 02:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
up so I guess I'm reading the bill and I
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
think um section three mhm I'm wondering
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
if it is incorrect or if this really
 
02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
what you met prob not the um the ratio
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
now is
 
02:21:25.469 --> 02:21:25.479 align:start position:0%
one teacher for every six children and I
 
02:21:28.429 --> 02:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
assumed you were doing multiples of two
 
02:21:31.469 --> 02:21:31.479 align:start position:0%
you would add one yeah so next on B it's
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
one associate teacher one assistant with
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
up to 12 that's did you really mean 13
 
02:21:41.590 --> 02:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
there uh probably did once once again it
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't my uh wasn't my it wasn't my
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
focus I was focused down below so yeah
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
if if we want to fix it or we want well
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
I just wonder I just wondered if it was
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
to I'm totally down to fix it um once my
 
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
focus really is the most book of test my
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
focus is that infant room um because
 
02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's where the biggest B that's
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
where the biggest burden is so it total
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
I would not surprise me if after after
 
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
one years old there were errors because
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
my focus is I'm like laser beamed on
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
that infant room I have one more
 
02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:10.910 align:start position:0%
that infant room I have one more
question

02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
certainly I was wondering
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
how and maybe there's someone in the
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
audience who will come later and you can
 
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
who will testify to this how does this
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
fit with the um fire Life Safety codes
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
yep so as I said in the testimony like
 
02:22:28.270 --> 02:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
this can't override the fire safety
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
codes right how it fits in I don't know
 
02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
but it can't override it um I said that
 
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the testimony and we we've had that
 
02:22:35.469 --> 02:22:35.479 align:start position:0%
conversation before about we can't just
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
because DHHS or I guess now the law
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
would say you can have nine in there if
 
02:22:42.270 --> 02:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
the fire code says eight guess what it's
 
02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
eight like that's just what it is so you
 
02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
haven't check we haven't checked this
 
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
no proposed law against what the fire
 
02:22:54.510 --> 02:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
codes now say no I I I've dealt with the
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
I've I've have I filled the fire code
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
with this committee I'm sure we'd have
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
to look at it at some point but my
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
intention is not to override the fire
 
02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
code okay thank you because I I that's
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
once again it's a safety conversation
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
that I don't I'm really trying to stay
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
as far away from that as possible
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
because that would be the quick death of
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:19.389 align:start position:0%
 
reasons

02:23:19.389 --> 02:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
02:23:24.359 --> 02:23:27.710 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
representative

02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:33.389 --> 02:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
Barry um the next card I have is for uh
 
02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:41.160 --> 02:23:43.309 align:start position:0%
 
herself

02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
herself
 
02:23:46.269 --> 02:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
hi hi thank you for um taking the time
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
to hear my testimony so although I don't
 
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
agree don't disagree with representative
 
02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
Barry that it would give us a little
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
more economic impact as a director um my
 
02:24:02.590 --> 02:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
infants don't eat sleep and eat at the
 
02:24:06.349 --> 02:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
same time they're up all day long um my
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
office is directly located next to there
 
02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you that I don't have a
 
02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
baby in my lap and and no picture on a
 
02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting cuz I'm feeding someone are
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
helping out because it's a constant flow
 
02:24:23.269 --> 02:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
in that room um and although the
 
02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
economic impact might be helpful I just
 
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
don't see putting that extra sta stress
 
02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
on a staff that are already stressed out
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
they're already working eight nine hours
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
a day um I don't over enroll I don't
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
over enroll for a reason because my
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
children need
 
02:24:44.190 --> 02:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
consistency um if I'm popping a
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
one-year-old into the 2-year-old room
 
02:24:48.190 --> 02:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
because their age appropriate but
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm over enrolled in my
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
one-year-old room that's not fair to
 
02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
that child um and it's not fair to that
 
02:24:54.910 --> 02:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
family because they're never getting
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
settled with the teacher and the same
 
02:24:58.870 --> 02:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
with babies babies need consistent
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
caregivers and the more you add to a
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
classroom the harder it is on the people
 
02:25:05.469 --> 02:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
in that classroom and I mean I'm in
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
ratio I have an eight an 8 to2 so I have
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
eight babies two teachers and there are
 
02:25:13.990 --> 02:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
multiple times that I am that third set
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
of hands to help out because they don't
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
all eat and sleep at the same time um
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
they do what they want to do when they
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
want to do it and they're as cute as can
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
be but they're in charge and we are not
 
02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
and kind of the same with my ones and
 
02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
twos even though there's a little bit
 
02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:29.870 align:start position:0%
twos even though there's a little bit
more

02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
schedule I can't imagine asking my
 
02:25:36.269 --> 02:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
teachers to take one more child um even
 
02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
if it was $2 I just can't imagine asking
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
them and I do think it will is it going
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
to be a big factor in the quality no but
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
it is going to have some imp impact and
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
our kids deserve to have the highest
 
02:25:52.269 --> 02:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
can thank you thank you can I ask you a
 
02:25:59.469 --> 02:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
question sure so do you agree that um
 
02:26:03.269 --> 02:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
would you agree that uh in this uh bill
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that a child care
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
facility has to increase to those ratios
 
02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
but in some cases some um facilities
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
might want to
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
so I think that we have to look at it as
 
02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
what's best for all children thank you
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
not what's best for us as the
 
02:26:31.269 --> 02:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
you have any more C cards does anybody
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
here have any questions we have the blue
 
02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:40.670 align:start position:0%
here have any questions we have the blue
sheet

02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
please representative wer um the
 
02:26:45.469 --> 02:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
licensing people are here they probably
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
don't have an opinion on the bill or
 
02:26:49.870 --> 02:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
want to voice one but I do want to know
 
02:26:53.469 --> 02:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
if how this fits with the fire safety
 
02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
codes hello meliss thank you for coming
 
02:27:07.469 --> 02:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
forward Melissa sure thank you um thank
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Al for the question
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
but that's a question for the State Fire
 
02:27:13.150 --> 02:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office I am not prepared to
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
answer for them because it's the state
 
02:27:20.670 --> 02:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.750 --> 02:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone here from the fire
 
02:27:27.269 --> 02:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
no they're watching they're watching
 
02:27:29.870 --> 02:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
may as an architect who deals with the
 
02:27:35.469 --> 02:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
same kind of square footage limitations
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh rep Barry's testimony was accurate
 
02:27:39.429 --> 02:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
that if you have a room that the square
 
02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
footage is acceptable for 11 children
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
but you only have the staff to do a
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
certain number you cannot ceed the
 
02:27:49.950 --> 02:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
square footage and that would Trump this
 
02:27:52.269 --> 02:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
legislation so if you're only allowed to
 
02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
have say seven children in the room then
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
you may by this legislation be allowed
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
to have nine with the two adults but you
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
can still only have seven because the
 
02:28:08.429 --> 02:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:11.710 --> 02:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
okay um just one um clarification
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams in in
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
addition to the square footage for State
 
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
Fire codes I do know they also have have
 
02:28:19.269 --> 02:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
client what they call client to staff
 
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
ratios so they also have a ratio in
 
02:28:24.190 --> 02:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
their fire code related to children and
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
staff it's not just the square footage
 
02:28:28.990 --> 02:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
but I'll let them speak to the
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
specificities just for clarification
 
02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
this bill in no way will compete with
 
02:28:38.349 --> 02:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
those fire codes so you have any further
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
question oh I just was going to say to
 
02:28:43.230 --> 02:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
the fire code people who are out there
 
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
listening could they could they please
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
could they please provide those to us
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that question I
 
02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
apologize that they cannot answer you
 
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
directly but I'm sure we will hear
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
some uh information from them they
 
02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:18.150 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:29:21.269 --> 02:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
turn this thing back on I do have the
 
02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
blue sheet there
 
02:29:25.710 --> 02:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
are uh
 
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
one six people signed up on the blue
 
02:29:34.269 --> 02:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
sheet five of them are uh con and one
 
02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:44.990 --> 02:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
all and with that I will close the
 
02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on uh House Bill
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
1407 and uh if uh chair Barry is in the
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
hallway can he duck his head in and let
 
02:30:10.990 --> 02:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.150 --> 02:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
reconvene how much time would you like
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
for lunch representative
 
02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:24.190 align:start position:0%
for lunch representative
Barry

02:30:24.190 --> 02:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:25.230 --> 02:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's the reason what time
 
02:30:28.429 --> 02:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
is it right now it's uh 12:40 yeah yeah
 
02:30:32.670 --> 02:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
so let's uh let's pick this back up um
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
let's pick this back up at 1:30 um and
 
02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:38.830 align:start position:0%
let's pick this back up at 1:30 um and
then

02:30:38.830 --> 02:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:30:42.030 --> 02:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh English I keep trying to want to call
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
you Rebecca it's very rude
 
02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams were you able
 
02:30:48.910 --> 02:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
to submit that to OS thank you chair
 
02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
Barry everyone present in in this
 
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
committee room was copied on the email
 
02:30:55.870 --> 02:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
to OSS I've asked for it by 2 o'clock
 
02:30:57.550 --> 02:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
that may be a miracle for them but if
 
02:30:59.269 --> 02:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
we're running late maybe that's okay all
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
right so we'll see everybody back at
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:15.359 --> 02:38:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.720 --> 03:25:30.790 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:25:30.790 --> 03:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:32.309 --> 03:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
jeez yeah this one this one's this is a
 
03:25:35.150 --> 03:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
fun one um this is a fun
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
one I think this is just straight up me
 
03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:39.389 align:start position:0%
one I think this is just straight up me
yep

03:25:39.389 --> 03:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:27:46.110 --> 03:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
chairman because I am the sole sponsor
 
03:27:50.910 --> 03:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill so I have to introduce it
 
03:27:54.830 --> 03:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have anyone I can hand the
 
03:27:59.110 --> 03:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:02.950 --> 03:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
so there she is okay she's
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:10.239 --> 03:28:14.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:28:14.910 --> 03:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:14.920 --> 03:28:40.189 align:start position:0%
 
all

03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:40.199 --> 03:28:53.950 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:28:53.950 --> 03:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:55.750 --> 03:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the hearing on House
 
03:28:55.760 --> 03:28:57.389 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the hearing on House
Bill

03:28:57.389 --> 03:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:29:00.990 --> 03:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
1409 and I'll call on representative
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
Ross Barry from Hillsboro 39
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
to excuse me to bring his bill to order
 
03:29:12.030 --> 03:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chairman my name is
 
03:29:13.349 --> 03:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative Ross Bay represent
 
03:29:16.469 --> 03:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
Manchester's a 689 the fighting South
 
03:29:20.070 --> 03:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
End as I like to say um and uh I'm here
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
to introduce hp1 1409 so let me talk
 
03:29:24.030 --> 03:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
about the intent of the bill because I'm
 
03:29:25.630 --> 03:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
sure if we decide to move forward with
 
03:29:28.150 --> 03:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
it at all it'll be modified probably
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
dramatically um but my intent of the
 
03:29:33.070 --> 03:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
bill is to further involve and further
 
03:29:36.110 --> 03:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
codify the child the child care advisory
 
03:29:40.189 --> 03:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
committee into dhs's Ru making process
 
03:29:41.870 --> 03:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:29:43.550 --> 03:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
the intention of this is obvious right
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
the childcare committee is composed of
 
03:29:48.389 --> 03:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
major stakeholders inside of the
 
03:29:52.229 --> 03:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
childcare industry um and having them be
 
03:29:55.990 --> 03:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
a integral part of this
 
03:29:59.830 --> 03:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
um it just seems logical right so
 
03:30:02.269 --> 03:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some things that uh
 
03:30:03.429 --> 03:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
probably will be said they're going to
 
03:30:05.469 --> 03:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
reference a court case from
 
03:30:09.229 --> 03:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
1981 um that says the legislature cannot
 
03:30:12.830 --> 03:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh dictate rulemakings um author dict
 
03:30:14.790 --> 03:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature cannot control the
 
03:30:16.429 --> 03:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
executive Branch's rule making Authority
 
03:30:17.550 --> 03:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
when the legislature gives away the
 
03:30:19.269 --> 03:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority uh it's a deeply
 
03:30:21.990 --> 03:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
flawed decision from over 40 years ago
 
03:30:23.309 --> 03:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
that will likely be overturned the
 
03:30:26.550 --> 03:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
moment any uh of us want to challenge it
 
03:30:29.630 --> 03:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
um as I said earlier um we are the
 
03:30:32.349 --> 03:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
legislator we control these things um
 
03:30:34.870 --> 03:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
when we give away rul making Authority
 
03:30:37.070 --> 03:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
we have every we are well within our
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
rights to control how that is given away
 
03:30:43.229 --> 03:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
um to say otherwise is actually a deeply
 
03:30:47.349 --> 03:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
flawed uh way of thinking so um I didn't
 
03:30:49.870 --> 03:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
really run I I spoke offhandedly with
 
03:30:51.950 --> 03:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
the child advisory committee about this
 
03:30:53.870 --> 03:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I I wouldn't say they signed off on
 
03:30:55.870 --> 03:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
it I just said Hey what if I submitted
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
this uh and kind of well yeah we'll talk
 
03:30:58.830 --> 03:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
about it I said all right well almost
 
03:31:02.429 --> 03:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
submit it um so basically if the DHHS
 
03:31:06.429 --> 03:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
proposes new rules uh the um the child
 
03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
care ad oh I'm sorry we're on the wrong
 
03:31:12.030 --> 03:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
bill um jeez I'm on the wrong one um
 
03:31:15.710 --> 03:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
um am I no I'm on the right pill sorry
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm like so out of it right now I can't
 
03:31:19.189 --> 03:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
do these things after lunch I did the
 
03:31:23.229 --> 03:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
problem is I didn't uh um there we go
 
03:31:26.189 --> 03:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
I've taken
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
um so this is the um I'm talking about I
 
03:31:33.309 --> 03:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
am talking about something differently
 
03:31:35.830 --> 03:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
um no no I am I'm on the rules making
 
03:31:37.790 --> 03:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
God I am so out of it y'all I did I for
 
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
the record I did nine hours in election
 
03:31:41.309 --> 03:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
all yesterday so my brain is really gone
 
03:31:43.750 --> 03:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
um no so we are talk uh if they they
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
they can look at this they can look at
 
03:31:46.870 --> 03:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
the basically the rule the ru making the
 
03:31:48.389 --> 03:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
rules that are proposed and they can say
 
03:31:52.670 --> 03:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
yes no before it moves on um I do think
 
03:31:54.510 --> 03:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
I do think you know currently the
 
03:31:56.070 --> 03:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislator doesn't have the ability to
 
03:31:59.269 --> 03:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
like say no um this is not giving the
 
03:32:01.790 --> 03:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
legislature that ability um which was my
 
03:32:04.990 --> 03:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
step around the 1981 decision um but I
 
03:32:06.309 --> 03:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
do think we have this legislative
 
03:32:08.189 --> 03:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
enacted body that is composed of
 
03:32:10.269 --> 03:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders chalk Care Center owners
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
people that have been in the industry
 
03:32:13.590 --> 03:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
for a very long time people with deep
 
03:32:16.150 --> 03:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge um and I think having them be
 
03:32:18.309 --> 03:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
a part of proposed rule making not to
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
say that DHHS doesn't already consult
 
03:32:21.870 --> 03:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
them I know that dhh does consult with
 
03:32:24.870 --> 03:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
them I know that DHHS does talk to them
 
03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm not saying that that line of
 
03:32:27.750 --> 03:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
communication doesn't already exist but
 
03:32:29.830 --> 03:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
what I would like to see is that
 
03:32:31.590 --> 03:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory committee to have
 
03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
some teeth to it so if they are really
 
03:32:36.349 --> 03:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
adamantly against something that DHHS is
 
03:32:38.550 --> 03:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
proposing they can be like no we're not
 
03:32:39.710 --> 03:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
going to do that it's bad for the
 
03:32:41.910 --> 03:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
industry it's bad bad for you know the
 
03:32:43.590 --> 03:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
quality or whatever reason they want to
 
03:32:46.349 --> 03:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
do it um you know that that committee
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
that committee is comprised of people I
 
03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
imagine they probably get along with
 
03:32:52.710 --> 03:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS most of the time um but I do think
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
I do think it's important that the
 
03:32:58.429 --> 03:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
providers the Childcare Center owners
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
the people inside the industry have a
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
deeper understanding of what's going
 
03:33:04.910 --> 03:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
into this um something we need to take a
 
03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
look at is I know that DHHS is in the
 
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
middle of a rewrite of all of the rules
 
03:33:10.560 --> 03:33:11.349 align:start position:0%
middle of a rewrite of all of the rules
um

03:33:11.349 --> 03:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:12.429 --> 03:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
I don't know where they are in that
 
03:33:13.389 --> 03:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
process I imagine they're probably
 
03:33:15.550 --> 03:33:15.560 align:start position:0%
getting near the end of it um one of the
 
03:33:17.110 --> 03:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
things that they had talked about that
 
03:33:19.389 --> 03:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
they were doing um was basically
 
03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
streamlining it to make the rules more
 
03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
understandable um and I think one of the
 
03:33:25.349 --> 03:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
things they'll probably talk to it about
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
it I think one of the things they're
 
03:33:27.790 --> 03:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
doing was separating It Out by license
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
types so you didn't so if you were
 
03:33:30.590 --> 03:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
opening up an at home center you were
 
03:33:32.150 --> 03:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
only looking at the atome center rules
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
and not the rules for the the different
 
03:33:36.910 --> 03:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
license types um so those sort of things
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
um I think we would probably need to
 
03:33:40.110 --> 03:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
delay the enactment because I think DHHS
 
03:33:42.269 --> 03:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
does need to finish that work um and I
 
03:33:43.469 --> 03:33:43.479 align:start position:0%
know they are working with the childcare
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
advisoring committee on that um so I
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to interrupt that process but
 
03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
after that process is done I would like
 
03:33:52.710 --> 03:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
to see a formal codification of the
 
03:33:55.229 --> 03:33:55.239 align:start position:0%
industry being involved in the rulle
 
03:33:57.630 --> 03:33:57.640 align:start position:0%
making process from the legislator so
 
03:34:00.349 --> 03:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
with that um happy to take any questions
 
03:34:02.349 --> 03:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
I I I know this thing will need work uh
 
03:34:03.870 --> 03:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
if we even decide to go forward with it
 
03:34:06.550 --> 03:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not I myself I'm not dead set on it
 
03:34:09.630 --> 03:34:09.640 align:start position:0%
um but uh definitely a conversation I
 
03:34:14.910 --> 03:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.830 --> 03:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
will you take questions oh yeah
 
03:34:18.790 --> 03:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative Paige thank you madam
 
03:34:22.429 --> 03:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
chair so reading the
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
bill and listening to your testimony I'm
 
03:34:28.189 --> 03:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing a little bit of a disconnect
 
03:34:30.030 --> 03:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's a misunderstanding and
 
03:34:32.910 --> 03:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
reading reading it but you know what I'm
 
03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
what I am hearing you say is having the
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
council have input into the promulgation
 
03:34:43.990 --> 03:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
of new rules yeah right whereas what I'm
 
03:34:49.150 --> 03:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
reading in the bill is that it's a role
 
03:34:52.349 --> 03:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
in the appeal process yeah I am sorry it
 
03:34:53.750 --> 03:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
it is the first bill that I was thinking
 
03:34:56.469 --> 03:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
of and not the second um I apologize
 
03:34:58.429 --> 03:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
about that no this is this is this is
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
the one I thought I was on um so this is
 
03:35:02.750 --> 03:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
the one about the appeals process for
 
03:35:04.830 --> 03:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
for when there's a of finding a
 
03:35:07.309 --> 03:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
violation um which is another thing that
 
03:35:08.510 --> 03:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
we have to have a conversation of so
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
right now if you're found in violation
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
sorry I got like five Child Care bills
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
um if they found in
 
03:35:16.750 --> 03:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
violation um you can appeal to DHHS you
 
03:35:18.110 --> 03:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
can get an administrative rules hearing
 
03:35:19.469 --> 03:35:19.479 align:start position:0%
they have a process outline for that in
 
03:35:21.990 --> 03:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
RSA um but you really are just kind of
 
03:35:24.550 --> 03:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
at the mercy of the bureaucracy um so
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
this would put you into the mercy of the
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory committee if they
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
wanted it um my guess is they may or may
 
03:35:33.309 --> 03:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
not want it um but I think it's worth
 
03:35:35.229 --> 03:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
you know if you have a violation and you
 
03:35:38.110 --> 03:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
want to appeal to you know if you if
 
03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
your lenser finds you in violation and
 
03:35:42.389 --> 03:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
you appeal to the licenser supervisor
 
03:35:43.790 --> 03:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
right and then you appeal to the
 
03:35:45.590 --> 03:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
director right you haven't really you
 
03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
haven't really ever gone into a new
 
03:35:49.550 --> 03:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
third party to kind of I don't want to
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
say arbitrate but let's say um get a
 
03:35:55.189 --> 03:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
second opinion right um they're they're
 
03:35:57.790 --> 03:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
they can say what they want but they're
 
03:35:59.389 --> 03:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
they're probably going to be predisposed
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
to reinforcing the finding um this would
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
put it in front of the chare advisory
 
03:36:05.830 --> 03:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee if you wanted to appeal it um
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's a way kind of talking about earlier
 
03:36:09.750 --> 03:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
I want to make it to where the industry
 
03:36:12.349 --> 03:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
is more self-re ating um and that's
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's what this is follow
 
03:36:20.710 --> 03:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
up so thank you for that clarification
 
03:36:24.830 --> 03:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
um so as you envision the council's role
 
03:36:28.150 --> 03:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
here the way I'm reading this is that
 
03:36:30.030 --> 03:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:36:33.630 --> 03:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
review and presentation of
 
03:36:35.630 --> 03:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations but we're not giving any
 
03:36:37.790 --> 03:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
kind of decision-making Authority in the
 
03:36:39.790 --> 03:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
appeals process correct so it's more
 
03:36:42.990 --> 03:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
just another voice at the
 
03:36:45.870 --> 03:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
table is that yeah that's where we're
 
03:36:47.830 --> 03:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
headed to I I want the like I said I
 
03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
know the bill is not done um but that's
 
03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
I want I want a third party involved in
 
03:36:57.389 --> 03:36:57.399 align:start position:0%
this process when there is a finding um
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
if the if they decide to contest the
 
03:37:01.710 --> 03:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
findings um and there's times when you
 
03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
want to contest the findings there's
 
03:37:03.990 --> 03:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
times you say yeah I messed up and you
 
03:37:07.229 --> 03:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
moved on um but you know there are times
 
03:37:08.990 --> 03:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
when I think I can give you an example
 
03:37:10.710 --> 03:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
like they accused me of not having
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
background checks done we had done all
 
03:37:13.389 --> 03:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
the background checks they just weren't
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
linked on the NH connections website
 
03:37:16.429 --> 03:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
well the finding said we hadn't done
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
background checks well we had done
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
background checks everybody had their
 
03:37:20.870 --> 03:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
cards right so that would be an example
 
03:37:22.670 --> 03:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
of you know hey uh we had the background
 
03:37:24.349 --> 03:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
checks everybody's fine um they're just
 
03:37:26.110 --> 03:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
not connected on the website so the
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
finding the finding there doesn't match
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
the the public stated finding doesn't
 
03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
match what actually happened so in these
 
03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
sort of situations uh we need to create
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
we need to have a third party in there
 
03:37:39.429 --> 03:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
to say hey like what's actually going on
 
03:37:41.229 --> 03:37:41.239 align:start position:0%
here um because you don't you really
 
03:37:43.510 --> 03:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a if you are caught in a
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
finding you don't really have a out you
 
03:37:48.110 --> 03:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
can't really get outside of the DHHS
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
you representative MC Williams thank you
 
03:38:00.389 --> 03:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair um thank you very much
 
03:38:01.710 --> 03:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
representative Barry for bringing
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
forward this bill um I would say that
 
03:38:06.429 --> 03:38:06.439 align:start position:0%
this is probably the most important
 
03:38:08.590 --> 03:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
issue that was discussed when we did a
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
study on the business of child care
 
03:38:13.229 --> 03:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
and uh impediments to succeeding in the
 
03:38:16.150 --> 03:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
business of child care um I suppose this
 
03:38:17.870 --> 03:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
is a would you believe but uh would you
 
03:38:19.630 --> 03:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
believe that the board of realators has
 
03:38:22.510 --> 03:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
a really interesting uh arbitration
 
03:38:24.950 --> 03:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
process for analyzing how things are
 
03:38:26.670 --> 03:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
dealt with internally and getting a
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
second opinion so that it's not just one
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
department is judge jury and executioner
 
03:38:34.269 --> 03:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
which uh was a direct quote from some of
 
03:38:36.269 --> 03:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard about five years
 
03:38:38.429 --> 03:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
ago from Child Care businesses who
 
03:38:39.990 --> 03:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
really felt like they were being singled
 
03:38:42.030 --> 03:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
out and accused of things that were not
 
03:38:45.389 --> 03:38:45.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily based on the facts uh and
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
also uh perhaps being singled out and
 
03:38:51.910 --> 03:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
continued to be singled out in repeat uh
 
03:38:54.389 --> 03:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
alleged violations that turned into
 
03:38:56.750 --> 03:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps losing their business I I I
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
would definitely believe that and I'm I
 
03:39:00.189 --> 03:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
I hadn't even thought to look at how the
 
03:39:01.830 --> 03:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
reals uh would do it as a potential
 
03:39:03.389 --> 03:39:03.399 align:start position:0%
framework obviously this thing is not
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
done um just one of those uh I'm a big
 
03:39:08.429 --> 03:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
fan of amendments so because if you can
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
get an amendment pass you can usually
 
03:39:12.349 --> 03:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
get a bill pass so um it definitely
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
would be something that I would love to
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
look into to see if there's already a
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
pre-established framework the other
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
thing we need to do is figure how to do
 
03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
the childcare advisory Council even
 
03:39:21.670 --> 03:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
wants this Duty uh they may say no to it
 
03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's very possible and then we have to
 
03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
go figure out something else if we want
 
03:39:26.510 --> 03:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
to do something um but I do think there
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be a third party involved here
 
03:39:30.030 --> 03:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
um the childcare advisor Council was
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
just the um immediate obvious choice um
 
03:39:34.550 --> 03:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't necessarily mean that
 
03:39:36.349 --> 03:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
they want to be the choice so they might
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
they might say absolutely not we don't
 
03:39:46.630 --> 03:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:50.469 --> 03:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
very good job I look forward to not
 
03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
getting my bills confused when we do do
 
03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
the rules one that'll be fun one too I'm
 
03:39:58.830 --> 03:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
sure you'll do better I'll Advocate on
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
that one as well I'll be
 
03:40:00.800 --> 03:40:03.110 align:start position:0%
that one as well I'll be
outside

03:40:03.110 --> 03:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
outside
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay while we're mentioning lunch I just
 
03:40:07.269 --> 03:40:07.279 align:start position:0%
want to make an announcement it's
 
03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
probably going to be easier this
 
03:40:12.110 --> 03:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon since we've hopefully all had
 
03:40:14.550 --> 03:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
lunch already but according to house
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
rules you're not to have anything to eat
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
or drink other than water while in this
 
03:40:22.750 --> 03:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
room so if you need to eat and a lot of
 
03:40:25.750 --> 03:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
people do please step out of the room if
 
03:40:27.389 --> 03:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
you need to drink anything other than
 
03:40:32.429 --> 03:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
water please step out of the room um and
 
03:40:36.189 --> 03:40:36.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh we won't get into any
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
trouble so I thank you for that and the
 
03:40:42.590 --> 03:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
next person that has asked to be uh able
 
03:40:44.950 --> 03:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
to be heard is uh
 
03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
minutes there you go thank you certainly
 
03:40:55.309 --> 03:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Maran barter I'm the chair of the
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire childcare advisory Council
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
and certainly we you know we we exist to
 
03:41:02.750 --> 03:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
serve so if we're asked to fill this
 
03:41:04.349 --> 03:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
role we can but I I hope that the
 
03:41:05.790 --> 03:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
committee thinks about our
 
03:41:07.550 --> 03:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
capacity right now the childcare
 
03:41:09.670 --> 03:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
advisory Council has one paid staff
 
03:41:11.830 --> 03:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
member and we're entirely volunteers
 
03:41:13.630 --> 03:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise so we really don't have the
 
03:41:16.349 --> 03:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
capacity to take on a something that has
 
03:41:19.229 --> 03:41:19.239 align:start position:0%
the chance of being as large as this one
 
03:41:21.429 --> 03:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
thing we could do is work with childcare
 
03:41:24.070 --> 03:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
licensing to create a peerreview group
 
03:41:25.790 --> 03:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
and to facilitate that process and that
 
03:41:27.830 --> 03:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
feels like something as um
 
03:41:29.229 --> 03:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams mentioned
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
that the field would be interested in
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
that they feel strongly about um and a
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
way to work with our DHHS Partners to
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
make sure everything is done in a
 
03:41:41.189 --> 03:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
systemic way that can give it the true
 
03:41:46.189 --> 03:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
it thank you any
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
much thank you so
 
03:41:56.429 --> 03:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
much the next people I'd like to call
 
03:41:59.670 --> 03:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
forward is Melissa Clement and
 
03:41:59.680 --> 03:42:03.990 align:start position:0%
forward is Melissa Clement and
Danielle

03:42:03.990 --> 03:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:11.229 --> 03:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
seat okay um thank you madam chair for
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Melissa Clement I'm the
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
chief of the childcare licensing unit
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
after listening to representative
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
Barry's testimony we don't feel we need
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
our legal council it was our legal
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
council was going to come up because
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
based on what we saw in the bill we
 
03:42:26.189 --> 03:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
thought that the intent was to have
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
another process after a re when we
 
03:42:31.750 --> 03:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
revoked a license finded a program so
 
03:42:33.630 --> 03:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
something and we already have a very
 
03:42:37.790 --> 03:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
robust appeals process so it sounds more
 
03:42:40.910 --> 03:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
like what he is looking for um um is
 
03:42:43.469 --> 03:42:43.479 align:start position:0%
what we call after our informal dispute
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
resolution process so what that means is
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
we've cited a program for a citation the
 
03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
program receives it does not feel that
 
03:42:52.110 --> 03:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
they were actually in violation of that
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
rule so then they appeal it to our
 
03:42:56.110 --> 03:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
office we have what's called an informal
 
03:42:58.469 --> 03:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process which we then
 
03:43:01.510 --> 03:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
get decided and then after that I
 
03:43:04.189 --> 03:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
believe what he's trying to propose is
 
03:43:06.510 --> 03:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
another once we've made our decision
 
03:43:08.469 --> 03:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
that there's another outside entity that
 
03:43:10.670 --> 03:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
will then review our decision and the
 
03:43:13.110 --> 03:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
facts and make another determination and
 
03:43:14.910 --> 03:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
bring that forth to the department and
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
we are in favor of that we have been
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
working with the childcare advisory
 
03:43:20.950 --> 03:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
Council on revising our rules and we
 
03:43:22.590 --> 03:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
have already started the conversations
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
of what is called an independent
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
informal dispute resolution process
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
which we are proposing to put in rule um
 
03:43:32.110 --> 03:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
this when we're revising our rules now
 
03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
and we will um be modeling it after what
 
03:43:38.269 --> 03:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
is happens in the adult licensing of
 
03:43:39.910 --> 03:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
facilities so they have a process
 
03:43:42.750 --> 03:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
process that comes to them from the
 
03:43:44.309 --> 03:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
federal government we have an internal
 
03:43:45.630 --> 03:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
State process that we're going to model
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
it on so we are in the process of doing
 
03:43:49.870 --> 03:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
that and the rules will be completed
 
03:43:52.750 --> 03:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
this year so we plan to move
 
03:43:57.429 --> 03:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:59.429 --> 03:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative crean thank you
 
03:44:04.510 --> 03:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious so in this process that
 
03:44:09.550 --> 03:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
you're in the process that you're in the
 
03:44:13.149 --> 03:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
process of developing um uh who are the
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
sort of outside folks that you're
 
03:44:17.070 --> 03:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
looking to get involved in this we're
 
03:44:18.189 --> 03:44:18.199 align:start position:0%
already in the middle of it so the
 
03:44:19.990 --> 03:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory Council actually
 
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
worked with us to create a group of
 
03:44:24.830 --> 03:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
child care providers so they're across
 
03:44:26.550 --> 03:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
the state they're all across different
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
types of childcare programs so they've
 
03:44:29.950 --> 03:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
all been part of this process as we're
 
03:44:32.189 --> 03:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
going through and revising the rules
 
03:44:32.199 --> 03:44:33.670 align:start position:0%
going through and revising the rules
great

03:44:33.670 --> 03:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:44:37.710 --> 03:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
follow thank you um so with that in
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
mind are you saying that you feel like
 
03:44:42.309 --> 03:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
there's not a need to put this into
 
03:44:44.030 --> 03:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
statute because there's something
 
03:44:47.149 --> 03:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
already happening or okay that just to
 
03:44:48.550 --> 03:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
make sure I have that I I believe that
 
03:44:50.189 --> 03:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
would be obviously that would be my
 
03:44:53.389 --> 03:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation because we we are doing
 
03:44:57.990 --> 03:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:01.870 --> 03:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:04.149 --> 03:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:45:06.189 --> 03:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
you and my final pink card is Jacqueline
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
up hi good afternoon I'm Jackie Cowell
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
from Early Learning New Hampshire um our
 
03:45:24.389 --> 03:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
organization has two voting seats on the
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
legislatively enacted childcare advisory
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
Council and I basically ditto what
 
03:45:32.950 --> 03:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
Maryann barter the chair and uh Melissa
 
03:45:34.269 --> 03:45:34.279 align:start position:0%
Clement said the only thing I would just
 
03:45:37.950 --> 03:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
sort of share in terms of um I've been
 
03:45:39.990 --> 03:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
in this field for a long time and
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes the childcare advisory council
 
03:45:44.950 --> 03:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
is listened to and is is actually a real
 
03:45:46.710 --> 03:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
genuine adviser and sometimes they're
 
03:45:49.389 --> 03:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
not you know depending on who's who's
 
03:45:51.990 --> 03:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
who and who's where and so I just think
 
03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know I I love the fact that you know
 
03:45:55.389 --> 03:45:55.399 align:start position:0%
with with Chief Melissa Clement and
 
03:45:58.349 --> 03:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
chair Maryann barter they've got a great
 
03:46:00.750 --> 03:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
strong relationship so that M you know
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
they're seating they're seating the
 
03:46:04.469 --> 03:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
panel that's working on the rules and
 
03:46:06.750 --> 03:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
reaching out directly to the field to do
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
that but there have been times where
 
03:46:10.389 --> 03:46:10.399 align:start position:0%
it's been really tough so I'm think just
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
thinking having if there is going to be
 
03:46:14.550 --> 03:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
a peer review board or something like
 
03:46:16.269 --> 03:46:16.279 align:start position:0%
that like I think Board of Nursing has
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
something like that which I the field
 
03:46:19.710 --> 03:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
does definitely as representative MC
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
Williams says is very eager to have some
 
03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
kind of a peerreview panel of some sort
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
I do think it's a good idea not for the
 
03:46:27.630 --> 03:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory Council to be the
 
03:46:30.149 --> 03:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
panel but to help seat that panel that
 
03:46:33.149 --> 03:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:38.189 --> 03:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:41.349 --> 03:46:41.359 align:start position:0%

speaker that this is not needed in
 
03:46:50.790 --> 03:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
statute that we can deal with this
 
03:46:56.750 --> 03:46:56.760 align:start position:0%

Care uses um first I mean I'm sure you
 
03:49:18.229 --> 03:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
guys have heard all the information but
 
03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
back in 2004 there was actually a study
 
03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
this is 2004 remember this dollars and
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
cents wise this was just for the central
 
03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire District that said Child
 
03:49:30.189 --> 03:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
Care enables parents to collect collect
 
03:49:35.110 --> 03:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
wages of $156 million annually just to
 
03:49:36.149 --> 03:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
Central New
 
03:49:38.030 --> 03:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire central New Hampshire Regional
 
03:49:39.309 --> 03:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
planning districts can't give you the
 
03:49:40.990 --> 03:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
the towns that they were but the thing
 
03:49:43.550 --> 03:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
is this is a study that's available um
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
did take me a little work to get the
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
executive summary on it a friend of mine
 
03:49:47.550 --> 03:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
actually did this study when she worked
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
with the Department with for that
 
03:49:50.790 --> 03:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
planning agency that pointed out the
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
value of child care to the state of New
 
03:49:54.910 --> 03:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over the last couple of years
 
03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
I've had the um working uh with folks or
 
03:50:00.429 --> 03:50:00.439 align:start position:0%
being at social events with childcare
 
03:50:01.870 --> 03:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
workers because my wife happens to be a
 
03:50:04.710 --> 03:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
childcare worker and um I always ran
 
03:50:06.229 --> 03:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
into this problem of people saying you
 
03:50:08.269 --> 03:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
know we're having problems locating our
 
03:50:09.790 --> 03:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
childcare in our community specific
 
03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
community and it was everywhere in the
 
03:50:14.349 --> 03:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I said well
 
03:50:15.790 --> 03:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
you know I think I may know what the
 
03:50:17.790 --> 03:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
problem is as a planner back in the late
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
80s I also was involved with zoning
 
03:50:22.389 --> 03:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
changes and site review and subdivision
 
03:50:24.510 --> 03:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
changes and one of the things is at the
 
03:50:26.349 --> 03:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
time we would saying how do we deal with
 
03:50:29.309 --> 03:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
childcare I says well easy solution
 
03:50:31.469 --> 03:50:31.479 align:start position:0%
let's make them home
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
occupations big mistake uh because as
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
soon as home inome home occupations now
 
03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
they're subjected to the regulations of
 
03:50:41.950 --> 03:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
um hours of operation outdoor storage of
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
equipment uh parking requirements um you
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
know and when they when Neighbors come
 
03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
in and start complaining about you know
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
what type of fence you need uh I mean a
 
03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
lot of this stuff is dealt with in HHS
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
regulations already for certified
 
03:50:57.910 --> 03:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
childcare centers so you know what I'm
 
03:51:01.389 --> 03:51:01.399 align:start position:0%
seeing here is that um people are not
 
03:51:03.389 --> 03:51:03.399 align:start position:0%
locating because they're having problems
 
03:51:06.790 --> 03:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
of paying $1,000 to have a survey or
 
03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
survey their property to meet the
 
03:51:10.189 --> 03:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
requirements of a local review requ
 
03:51:11.590 --> 03:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
having a lawyer having to attend a
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
meeting to present their case for him
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
before a local planning board um the
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
requirements that a planning board can
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
put through site review can be quite
 
03:51:21.790 --> 03:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
honorous one of the things that I know
 
03:51:23.349 --> 03:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature did in the past is they
 
03:51:25.269 --> 03:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
said that you couldn't that you couldn't
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
Zone Child Care out they didn't say
 
03:51:30.510 --> 03:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
anything about site review that seems to
 
03:51:32.110 --> 03:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
be where the problem was when I
 
03:51:33.750 --> 03:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
submitted this bill in originally I had
 
03:51:35.590 --> 03:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
put it under RSA
 
03:51:38.110 --> 03:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
6721 and I found out after I had
 
03:51:40.349 --> 03:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
somebody review it they said uh Ben
 
03:51:43.030 --> 03:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
Frost you probably know Ben he's a old
 
03:51:44.469 --> 03:51:44.479 align:start position:0%
friend of mine from the plan my planning
 
03:51:46.030 --> 03:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
years as well and he said you know
 
03:51:48.149 --> 03:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
something the zoning provision that we
 
03:51:51.429 --> 03:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
have in the rsas is in an aspirational
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
section of the or of the RSA so really
 
03:51:55.670 --> 03:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
it has very little enforcement Authority
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
you need to put it in the implementation
 
03:52:00.389 --> 03:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
section and that's why under 67416 is
 
03:52:02.189 --> 03:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
where we ended up doing this and what I
 
03:52:03.830 --> 03:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
did is we've got sort of like belts and
 
03:52:07.870 --> 03:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
suspenders here not only is both the
 
03:52:10.149 --> 03:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
zoning which previously passed by the
 
03:52:13.229 --> 03:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
legislature but my provision to
 
03:52:15.990 --> 03:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
exempt small child care facilities from
 
03:52:18.429 --> 03:52:18.439 align:start position:0%
site review are both in 672 the
 
03:52:21.189 --> 03:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
aspirational section and 674 the
 
03:52:24.149 --> 03:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
implementation section so that when a
 
03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
planning when a childcare wants to open
 
03:52:28.269 --> 03:52:28.279 align:start position:0%
they will not have to go before a
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
planning board and spend what could be
 
03:52:32.110 --> 03:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and what happens in
 
03:52:35.189 --> 03:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
most cases they just don't go uh they
 
03:52:38.550 --> 03:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
end up operating without um a license in
 
03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
many cases
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
and you'll see many communities you'll
 
03:52:43.229 --> 03:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
say there are no family child care or
 
03:52:44.429 --> 03:52:44.439 align:start position:0%
group family child carees in this
 
03:52:46.710 --> 03:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
community there may be they're just not
 
03:52:48.790 --> 03:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
licensed and that's the problem that we
 
03:52:50.189 --> 03:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
have we want to make sure our our
 
03:52:53.229 --> 03:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
licensing is provides for safe and
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
affordable child care um one of the
 
03:52:57.550 --> 03:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
things my son happens to be the director
 
03:53:00.070 --> 03:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
of the National Guards uh Family Support
 
03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
Services here in New Hampshire and one
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the things they're looking for
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
National Guard uh they look for child
 
03:53:07.429 --> 03:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
care for the National Guard people who
 
03:53:09.710 --> 03:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
work who have have weekend duties
 
03:53:12.149 --> 03:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
or the twoe duty whatever and the thing
 
03:53:14.149 --> 03:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
is is that they need to be
 
03:53:16.149 --> 03:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
licensed and this is one of the problems
 
03:53:18.670 --> 03:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
we're having he cannot contract with a
 
03:53:24.110 --> 03:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
non-licensed child care also they need
 
03:53:26.590 --> 03:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
weekends larger childcare centers don't
 
03:53:28.469 --> 03:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
work on weekends in fact they don't work
 
03:53:30.870 --> 03:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
after six o'clock in most cases it's
 
03:53:32.710 --> 03:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
difficult to find Child Care on weekends
 
03:53:36.229 --> 03:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
and and after certain hours family child
 
03:53:37.469 --> 03:53:37.479 align:start position:0%
care and group family child are the only
 
03:53:38.790 --> 03:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
places that can happen and that's the
 
03:53:40.830 --> 03:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
only only cases is provide when we had a
 
03:53:42.950 --> 03:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
we had a a family chalk here at my house
 
03:53:44.309 --> 03:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
we used to take a lot of the nurses from
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
the local hospital and many times we had
 
03:53:48.510 --> 03:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
the nurse saying I'm going into a
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
surgery it's probably going to be
 
03:53:51.070 --> 03:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
difficult I don't know what time I'm
 
03:53:53.189 --> 03:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
going to get out you can't call a center
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
and say that but you can call a family
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
child care or a group family child you
 
03:53:59.590 --> 03:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
can call them and they will provide the
 
03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
services for you they will provide
 
03:54:02.229 --> 03:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
weekend Services you they will provide
 
03:54:05.149 --> 03:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
overnight services for you we don't have
 
03:54:06.910 --> 03:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
that available to us in many cases right
 
03:54:09.750 --> 03:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
now because not all they're not being
 
03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
driven out by zoning but they' be driven
 
03:54:13.870 --> 03:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
about excessive cost and requirements
 
03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
that site review has now this bill does
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
not deal with building inspectors or
 
03:54:20.349 --> 03:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
fire inspectors those people are still
 
03:54:21.389 --> 03:54:21.399 align:start position:0%
going to exist and there's still going
 
03:54:23.070 --> 03:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
to be a pain in the butt to most
 
03:54:23.080 --> 03:54:24.189 align:start position:0%
to be a pain in the butt to most
childcare

03:54:24.189 --> 03:54:24.199 align:start position:0%
childcare
 
03:54:26.990 --> 03:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
workers most childcare centers can I not
 
03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:28.550 align:start position:0%
workers most childcare centers can I not
say

03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:54:31.870 --> 03:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
that you can say that again and again if
 
03:54:33.149 --> 03:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
you want to say it louder turn the
 
03:54:35.309 --> 03:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
volume I I I know but you know and and
 
03:54:36.830 --> 03:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
the thing is is that the thing is
 
03:54:38.630 --> 03:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
they're still there this is just the
 
03:54:40.469 --> 03:54:40.479 align:start position:0%
first First Step you know if we need to
 
03:54:41.870 --> 03:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
deal with other things we'll we'll work
 
03:54:43.750 --> 03:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
on that next but let's see if we can get
 
03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
to make Child Care truly affordable and
 
03:54:48.870 --> 03:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
to allow people to open up that want to
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
open up centers in communities where
 
03:54:52.590 --> 03:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
there is a need you folks all I'm
 
03:54:54.030 --> 03:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
speaking the choir when I say there is a
 
03:54:55.990 --> 03:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
need out there we all know that and we
 
03:54:57.990 --> 03:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
all know what the what the financial
 
03:55:01.189 --> 03:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
impl implications are of not having
 
03:55:03.670 --> 03:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
adequate Child Care safe licensed child
 
03:55:05.790 --> 03:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
care in the state of New Hampshire and I
 
03:55:07.229 --> 03:55:07.239 align:start position:0%
would I have a number of people that
 
03:55:09.590 --> 03:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
will be speaking here uh that have uh
 
03:55:10.870 --> 03:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
that have childcare centers here in the
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and talking about
 
03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
it and most of you already know these
 
03:55:17.630 --> 03:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
issues this is just one step um I you
 
03:55:19.070 --> 03:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
know I was with Mary Jane and when she
 
03:55:20.030 --> 03:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
said you know how are we going to deal
 
03:55:21.149 --> 03:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
with this problem I says we'll just
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
eliminate site review Provisions she
 
03:55:25.870 --> 03:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
said that'll never happen and when I got
 
03:55:27.510 --> 03:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative Barry as a closep so I
 
03:55:31.149 --> 03:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:33.149 --> 03:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
happen I'll be happy to answer any of
 
03:55:34.870 --> 03:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
your questions we okay perfect
 
03:55:36.750 --> 03:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
representa D
 
03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
Simone thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and please give
 
03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
my best to your wife Ann it was a
 
03:55:44.910 --> 03:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
pleasure serving with her on children
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
and family law I certainly will thank
 
03:55:48.870 --> 03:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
you if she doesn't yell at me after
 
03:55:51.950 --> 03:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
watching this so no I'm sure she
 
03:55:54.910 --> 03:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
won't further I apologize I thought you
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
were just being nice please ask your
 
03:55:57.990 --> 03:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
question I'm so sorry it was so rude of
 
03:56:01.790 --> 03:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
me no you're okay I I'll forgive you I'm
 
03:56:03.469 --> 03:56:03.479 align:start position:0%
in a forgiving
 
03:56:08.110 --> 03:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
mood right now any um my question to you
 
03:56:10.469 --> 03:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
is can you explain the difference
 
03:56:13.429 --> 03:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
between the permitting process and the
 
03:56:16.269 --> 03:56:16.279 align:start position:0%
licensing process because they're two
 
03:56:18.429 --> 03:56:18.439 align:start position:0%
different animals right well I'm not
 
03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
sure what you mean I know the permitting
 
03:56:22.030 --> 03:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
process from from a planning board as a
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
town planner I'm not sure about the
 
03:56:24.990 --> 03:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
licensing process I know there are a
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
number of regulations there are people
 
03:56:28.510 --> 03:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
here that can speak on that and that
 
03:56:30.269 --> 03:56:30.279 align:start position:0%
licensing has a lot of the requirements
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
that most planting Woods would be
 
03:56:33.510 --> 03:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
already looking at such as how much land
 
03:56:35.309 --> 03:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
area you have to have and when you come
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
into a planning board you say I want to
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
open up a childcare um I'm going to have
 
03:56:41.070 --> 03:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
six kids I want to open up a childcare
 
03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
in my community what happens is is that
 
03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
you fill out all these forms you have to
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
provide plans of your building and the
 
03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
area that you're going to use you have
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
to take a look at their regulations and
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're going to ask you what
 
03:56:53.870 --> 03:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
have your what are your hours of
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
operations because the neighbors are
 
03:56:56.189 --> 03:56:56.199 align:start position:0%
going to complain if you you're
 
03:56:58.110 --> 03:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
operating overnight I don't know what
 
03:56:59.510 --> 03:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
having maybe two kids that end up
 
03:57:00.790 --> 03:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
spending the night because a mother is
 
03:57:02.990 --> 03:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
working is going to be a problem I mean
 
03:57:04.389 --> 03:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
if the Brady Bunch were living in that
 
03:57:06.550 --> 03:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
house it would be much more of a problem
 
03:57:08.189 --> 03:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
than having two kids that spend the
 
03:57:09.870 --> 03:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
night with you where you may have two of
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
your own um and and but they're going to
 
03:57:14.110 --> 03:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
ask you those questions they're going to
 
03:57:15.550 --> 03:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
say that there are regulations you can't
 
03:57:17.269 --> 03:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
have any outside storage of equipment
 
03:57:18.910 --> 03:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
that's an normal so in other words that
 
03:57:19.990 --> 03:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
swing set that you put up you have to
 
03:57:22.389 --> 03:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
take down every night um you know these
 
03:57:23.550 --> 03:57:23.560 align:start position:0%
are just some of the things they can do
 
03:57:24.710 --> 03:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to require that if you
 
03:57:26.910 --> 03:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
have a non- relative employee you're
 
03:57:28.990 --> 03:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to have parking um you
 
03:57:30.189 --> 03:57:30.199 align:start position:0%
know you may have to have so many
 
03:57:31.790 --> 03:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
parking spaces per the number of kids
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
you have I don't know what their
 
03:57:34.990 --> 03:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
regulations could be but it could be
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
it's nebulous what they could have for
 
03:57:39.070 --> 03:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
requirements in their zoning and review
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
regulations and what this does is
 
03:57:42.349 --> 03:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
they're already exempts childcare is
 
03:57:44.670 --> 03:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
already exempt from from zoning now
 
03:57:46.710 --> 03:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
there's the site review to continue on
 
03:57:48.550 --> 03:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
with what the question you ask they will
 
03:57:49.990 --> 03:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
be required to come to a meeting they
 
03:57:51.750 --> 03:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
will possibly ask to provide a site plan
 
03:57:52.990 --> 03:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
which means they have to get a survey
 
03:57:55.389 --> 03:57:55.399 align:start position:0%
done of their property and heaven forbid
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
they have Wetlands on that property that
 
03:57:58.429 --> 03:57:58.439 align:start position:0%
could be further out back and they may
 
03:57:59.790 --> 03:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
have to actually get a wetland scientist
 
03:58:01.710 --> 03:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
to identify those Wetlands that may be
 
03:58:03.990 --> 03:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
well off where the play area is going to
 
03:58:06.990 --> 03:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
be but that's what the rules require now
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
that could be thousands of dollars
 
03:58:11.550 --> 03:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
right there then they've got all their
 
03:58:13.030 --> 03:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors get notified that they're
 
03:58:14.670 --> 03:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
going to have six kids at their house
 
03:58:15.950 --> 03:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
during the day or maybe even on a
 
03:58:18.550 --> 03:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
Saturday or a Sunday and the thing is
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
that all those Neighbors come in and
 
03:58:21.790 --> 03:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
start complaining about what about all
 
03:58:22.990 --> 03:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
that parking that's going to happen
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to jam up the streets uh
 
03:58:26.790 --> 03:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
with with parking for these six kids
 
03:58:27.750 --> 03:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be impossible it's going
 
03:58:29.229 --> 03:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
to be like going down the local school
 
03:58:30.790 --> 03:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
where there you 50 cars lined up in
 
03:58:33.070 --> 03:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
front of the house I'm surprised nobody
 
03:58:34.189 --> 03:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
said you'd have to have one parking
 
03:58:36.030 --> 03:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
space per child on your
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
property but you know these are the
 
03:58:40.710 --> 03:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
requirements that they go through and
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
then when you get that now the person's
 
03:58:44.830 --> 03:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
already said okay my neighbors hate me
 
03:58:46.189 --> 03:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
probably the best thing is to not open
 
03:58:49.389 --> 03:58:49.399 align:start position:0%
this childcare or move and then so they
 
03:58:51.070 --> 03:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
don't apply they they drop out of the
 
03:58:52.269 --> 03:58:52.279 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
process and what what happens is is that
 
03:58:59.870 --> 03:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
they will probably six months later open
 
03:59:01.710 --> 03:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
without being certified without getting
 
03:59:03.469 --> 03:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
certification from the state and without
 
03:59:05.950 --> 03:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
the knowledge of the local planning
 
03:59:08.469 --> 03:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
board or local or the town and then
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody will complain because
 
03:59:11.389 --> 03:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
they see three extra kids in there and
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know the situation is they're my
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
friend's kids they're over to play with
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's a play date you know it's not a
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
child care you know you you put them
 
03:59:19.349 --> 03:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
into situations like that which are
 
03:59:20.950 --> 03:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
totally you know we shouldn't be doing
 
03:59:22.910 --> 03:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
that and when you're taking a look at
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
Family childcare and group family child
 
03:59:26.830 --> 03:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
care um you know we looked at the
 
03:59:28.309 --> 03:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
regulations when we were going through
 
03:59:29.710 --> 03:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
this and I talked with the people in the
 
03:59:32.229 --> 03:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
field and they said those are the two
 
03:59:33.910 --> 03:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
that we're really concerned about mostly
 
03:59:35.349 --> 03:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
because of the flexibility that they
 
03:59:38.030 --> 03:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
have somebody has a big piece of land
 
03:59:39.349 --> 03:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
they may have have a barn that they can
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
use for child you know for some
 
03:59:42.429 --> 03:59:42.439 align:start position:0%
activities in the winter time or
 
03:59:44.229 --> 03:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
whatever or in inclement weather and
 
03:59:46.429 --> 03:59:46.439 align:start position:0%
they can have a group family child care
 
03:59:47.790 --> 03:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
or if they've got a smaller place they
 
03:59:49.710 --> 03:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
can have a child care it says and it
 
03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
also says in the law that as it's
 
03:59:55.229 --> 03:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
proposed it says that it has to be
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
located in as an accessory use anywhere
 
04:00:01.550 --> 04:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
where a residential use is allowed
 
04:00:03.269 --> 04:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
accessory use which means the primary
 
04:00:05.229 --> 04:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
use has to be a residence so somebody
 
04:00:06.790 --> 04:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
can't buy a house I know people have
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
said could we do that that you may want
 
04:00:10.630 --> 04:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
to amend the bill say it doesn't have to
 
04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
be an accessory use that it could be
 
04:00:13.990 --> 04:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
just a house in a neighborhood the bill
 
04:00:16.750 --> 04:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
that I put in was just a small step and
 
04:00:18.870 --> 04:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's a Light Lift very easy lift
 
04:00:20.429 --> 04:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
for this committee to say yes on this
 
04:00:22.149 --> 04:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
bill because it says it has to be an
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
accessory use in other words the people
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
would have to live in the property in
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
order to have this
 
04:00:32.070 --> 04:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
so further questions from the committee
 
04:00:33.469 --> 04:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
I I'll hit you with the would you
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
believe uh would gra would you believe
 
04:00:39.030 --> 04:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh that I view
 
04:00:42.429 --> 04:00:42.439 align:start position:0%
um uh family and group and group Family
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
Care Centers as one of the major
 
04:00:46.110 --> 04:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
solutions to the child care crisis
 
04:00:47.510 --> 04:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
especially in our rural
 
04:00:49.590 --> 04:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
communities certainly and I'll tell you
 
04:00:51.389 --> 04:00:51.399 align:start position:0%
that working with my wife who works for
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
the Rochester Childcare Center now as a
 
04:00:54.830 --> 04:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
family Outreach coordinator there I mean
 
04:00:56.550 --> 04:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they do people
 
04:00:57.550 --> 04:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
look at this is that well that's
 
04:00:59.269 --> 04:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
competition no it's not because they
 
04:01:01.630 --> 04:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
have no spaces they cannot provide the
 
04:01:03.750 --> 04:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
service the large centers have run out
 
04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
of space and they're looking at this and
 
04:01:07.590 --> 04:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
they also have the the inability to be
 
04:01:07.600 --> 04:01:08.910 align:start position:0%
they also have the the inability to be
flexible

04:01:08.910 --> 04:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
04:01:11.070 --> 04:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
um you know this is something that yes
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
this is very important I mean this will
 
04:01:16.269 --> 04:01:16.279 align:start position:0%
provide a tremendous assistance to our
 
04:01:17.910 --> 04:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
child care uh opportunities here in the
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
04:01:21.469 --> 04:01:21.479 align:start position:0%

Trimble
 
04:02:41.429 --> 04:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you my name is
 
04:02:43.229 --> 04:02:43.239 align:start position:0%
Shannon Trembley I'm the director of the
 
04:02:45.790 --> 04:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory Council however today
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of a fellow resident
 
04:02:52.429 --> 04:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
of Hampton New Hampshire who um tried to
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
open a child care business um Hampton is
 
04:02:57.870 --> 04:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
a well populated town however we only
 
04:03:02.429 --> 04:03:02.439 align:start position:0%
have 206 licensed spots for child care
 
04:03:04.349 --> 04:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
um and probably only a quarter of those
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
are you know being able to be open now
 
04:03:11.229 --> 04:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
um so this is from Abigail Gavin uh
 
04:03:13.790 --> 04:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
Galvin sorry I'm writing this letter in
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
support of HB 1567 that allows for
 
04:03:18.870 --> 04:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
residential homes to open child care
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
facilities in June of 2023 I bought a
 
04:03:24.269 --> 04:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
new house not only to be my primary
 
04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
resident residence but also for the
 
04:03:28.950 --> 04:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of opening an inhome daycare
 
04:03:31.469 --> 04:03:31.479 align:start position:0%
business I spent months renovating and
 
04:03:33.870 --> 04:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
preparing the space so that it would be
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
ready for by the beginning of the school
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
year in September I worked with
 
04:03:39.389 --> 04:03:39.399 align:start position:0%
childcare license licensing health and
 
04:03:41.590 --> 04:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
building inspectors to make the space
 
04:03:44.510 --> 04:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
safe and reliable for child care after
 
04:03:46.590 --> 04:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
in investing a significant amount of
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
money and time I went to the zoning
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
board where it was shut down along with
 
04:03:53.309 --> 04:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
the zoning board members disagreeing
 
04:03:54.990 --> 04:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
with the business multiple neighbors
 
04:03:56.469 --> 04:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
wrote letters complaining about a
 
04:03:58.229 --> 04:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
business being opened in their
 
04:04:00.429 --> 04:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood these neighbors
 
04:04:02.229 --> 04:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
were unaware of the child care crisis
 
04:04:04.189 --> 04:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
that is happening in our town State and
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
Country and also unaware that in inhome
 
04:04:10.710 --> 04:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
daycare is much is a much different type
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
of business one that does not create an
 
04:04:15.309 --> 04:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
additional burden to on the neighbors
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
not only did I quit my regular job as a
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
public school teacher to B to provide
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
the service for the community I also had
 
04:04:24.510 --> 04:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
parents who were relying on me for child
 
04:04:26.349 --> 04:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
care for their child there is a
 
04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
desperate need for child care in my town
 
04:04:30.189 --> 04:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
we are looking to provide parents with a
 
04:04:32.229 --> 04:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
safe Comfort comfortable place for their
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
children to learn and grow in our town
 
04:04:37.149 --> 04:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
like many towns in New Hampshire we are
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
in a daycare desert where there are no
 
04:04:41.149 --> 04:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
available options for family in need of
 
04:04:43.189 --> 04:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
child care centers have a long wait list
 
04:04:44.670 --> 04:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
and families are left with having to
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
make choices about staying home to care
 
04:04:48.590 --> 04:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
for their children or entering the
 
04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
workforce we need more reliable child
 
04:04:52.710 --> 04:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
care options and allowing inhome
 
04:04:55.030 --> 04:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
daycares is a great place to start this
 
04:04:56.670 --> 04:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
is why I feel very passionate about
 
04:04:58.910 --> 04:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
zoning boards being more flexible when
 
04:05:01.389 --> 04:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
it comes to people trying to open child
 
04:05:03.750 --> 04:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
care businesses in residential areas
 
04:05:05.790 --> 04:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
without access to child care parents are
 
04:05:08.269 --> 04:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
unable to work and that is negative
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
affecting our economy and people's lives
 
04:05:12.830 --> 04:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
I hope this letter will be strongly
 
04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
considered in your decisions going
 
04:05:17.149 --> 04:05:17.159 align:start position:0%

joy and pleasure to be um in the
 
04:06:18.389 --> 04:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
franchising space for child care and
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
we've really um come to establish small
 
04:06:24.110 --> 04:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
family child care centers across the
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
state oh sorry I have handouts um it's
 
04:06:29.630 --> 04:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
really become an area of focus for us
 
04:06:31.870 --> 04:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
and well that I'm enjoying very much and
 
04:06:33.389 --> 04:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of room for growth in the
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.800 --> 04:06:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
out

04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
there so while those are being handed
 
04:06:54.149 --> 04:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
out I do have um another letter of
 
04:06:56.030 --> 04:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
testimony from plasto New Hampshire from
 
04:06:57.790 --> 04:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
another family care provider she
 
04:06:59.110 --> 04:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today because
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
shockingly she's working um I can read
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
it into testimony or I can hand it in
 
04:07:06.070 --> 04:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
but it really Echoes the same
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
conversation that Abby had um do you
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
want me to go into this letter I think
 
04:07:12.030 --> 04:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
um I think I know how this one's going
 
04:07:15.070 --> 04:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
to shake out so not to be like rude but
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time y I'll will take
 
04:07:19.630 --> 04:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
the letter um I will I will read it but
 
04:07:21.750 --> 04:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
I think uh I think you'll be pleasantly
 
04:07:24.510 --> 04:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
surprised so I think the I think the
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
resounding message from this particular
 
04:07:28.510 --> 04:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
letter is that she was able to set up a
 
04:07:30.109 --> 04:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
commercial Child Care space in three
 
04:07:32.550 --> 04:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
weeks family child care took over six
 
04:07:34.349 --> 04:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
months and thousands of
 
04:07:38.670 --> 04:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
dollars in her home okay so
 
04:07:40.590 --> 04:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
obviously we understand why we're here
 
04:07:42.550 --> 04:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know this is an accessory use for
 
04:07:45.070 --> 04:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
your house that already exists you know
 
04:07:48.070 --> 04:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
legislating things like you know can you
 
04:07:49.750 --> 04:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
have a fenced in front yard versus
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
backyard there's there's so many like
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
nitpicky things that towns have started
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
to kind of come up with that really keep
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
family child care from opening in their
 
04:08:01.950 --> 04:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
town if you look at the regions with
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
gaps Hampton is a big area we looked at
 
04:08:06.910 --> 04:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
a 10 mile radius in these circles
 
04:08:09.030 --> 04:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
there're zero family childcare providers
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
there's 349 spaces that are available
 
04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
that people need to fill conquered three
 
04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
pages of legislation like for Family
 
04:08:19.109 --> 04:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
Care Providers it's very hard to open
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
and conquered shockingly no providers
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
626 spaces that need to be filled and
 
04:08:28.750 --> 04:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
conquered as a gap Berlin small area
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
this is where Family Care is really
 
04:08:32.710 --> 04:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
important these small communities they
 
04:08:34.710 --> 04:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
can't sustain centers of a hundred they
 
04:08:37.630 --> 04:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
need family child care here within a 20
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
mile radius zero Family Care Providers
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
87 spaces needed Keen 10 mile radius no
 
04:08:46.670 --> 04:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
providers 215 spaces really took this
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
data from across the entire State
 
04:08:50.830 --> 04:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
there's no one region that's not
 
04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
affected by this it's the entire state
 
04:08:55.870 --> 04:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
so there's 22,000 licensed Child Care
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
spaces that are needed across the state
 
04:09:00.189 --> 04:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire two in five children
 
04:09:02.750 --> 04:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
are working in Working Families in New
 
04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire don't have access to licensed
 
04:09:05.910 --> 04:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
childcare where their parents are at
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
work do we want them in licens exemp
 
04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
child care or in Babysitting like or
 
04:09:15.149 --> 04:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
care providers who have to lie no we we
 
04:09:16.830 --> 04:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
want these environments to be safe for
 
04:09:18.670 --> 04:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
our children and know that they're going
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
to be available consistently a rich and
 
04:09:23.229 --> 04:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
diverse array of child care options
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
should be available to these families
 
04:09:27.070 --> 04:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
which support Family Choice and child
 
04:09:29.229 --> 04:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
care services some children are not
 
04:09:31.630 --> 04:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
going to succeed in a center of a 100
 
04:09:34.109 --> 04:09:34.119 align:start position:0%
they need small more Hands-On learning
 
04:09:35.870 --> 04:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
environments with that that smaller
 
04:09:37.630 --> 04:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
ratio of you know six children with with
 
04:09:41.229 --> 04:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
one provider it gives parent choice
 
04:09:44.189 --> 04:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
evenings weekends times that they need
 
04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
or more convenient for their child's
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
style of learning So Family Care is a
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
really important role for our families
 
04:09:54.109 --> 04:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
um like Chuck said they provide flexible
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
hours nights weekends small personal
 
04:09:58.630 --> 04:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
learning environments in the tuition
 
04:10:00.630 --> 04:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
let's be honest the reimbursement rate
 
04:10:02.710 --> 04:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
is lower for family child care tuition
 
04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
is usually lower because you don't have
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
the overhead of all the commercial space
 
04:10:09.229 --> 04:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
so it is a really important choice for
 
04:10:12.309 --> 04:10:12.319 align:start position:0%
some of our families in struggl regions
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
um and as Chuck said I don't know if he
 
04:10:16.189 --> 04:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
had the same number but the economic
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
impact in New Hampshire from this child
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
care Gap is $262
 
04:10:23.429 --> 04:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
million this is too large of a number to
 
04:10:27.910 --> 04:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
ignore this this problem so that's it
 
04:10:30.189 --> 04:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
okay well we been taking questions yes
 
04:10:32.510 --> 04:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
are questions from the committee seeing
 
04:10:35.469 --> 04:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
none thank you um last up is Michelle
 
04:10:39.710 --> 04:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:42.990 --> 04:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
there no no no you definitely did it's
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh the glasses aren't doing much these
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
days thank you Mr chair honorable
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee again my name
 
04:10:51.910 --> 04:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
is Michelle Merritt I'm the president at
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
new futures for those that are not
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
familiar with our organization we're a
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit Health policy and
 
04:11:00.269 --> 04:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization doing Statewide
 
04:11:02.269 --> 04:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
policy work however we also are the
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
state's designated kids count
 
04:11:05.429 --> 04:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
organization and have been bringing
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
forward data informed policy solution to
 
04:11:10.590 --> 04:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
some of our most pressing challenges and
 
04:11:13.309 --> 04:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
those in the child care space is one um
 
04:11:15.229 --> 04:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
Jen obviously I think hit all of the
 
04:11:16.910 --> 04:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
points so I want to appreciate the
 
04:11:19.469 --> 04:11:19.479 align:start position:0%
committee's time um I do just want to
 
04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
again reiterate that 46% of children in
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire live in a child care
 
04:11:24.990 --> 04:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
desert and while we can look at our
 
04:11:26.670 --> 04:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
child care centers and they're doing a
 
04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
lot to try to close the gap in the
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
number of slots that we need in order to
 
04:11:33.269 --> 04:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
meet demand from families they cannot
 
04:11:36.189 --> 04:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
possibly fill that void on their own um
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
there is no silver bullets solution to
 
04:11:40.070 --> 04:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
the child care crisis but this is one
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
important strategy of supporting family
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
and small group uh facilities that I
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
think is an important step for us to
 
04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
take as a state to make it a more
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
hospitable environment for those that
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
want to establish Child Care Centers and
 
04:11:55.590 --> 04:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
um become child care providers in this
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
state so I'll I'll leave it at that but
 
04:11:59.590 --> 04:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
if there are any questions I'm happy to
 
04:12:01.149 --> 04:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
take them and again would Echo the
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
comments from those prior to me right
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
04:12:08.109 --> 04:12:08.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
04:12:11.309 --> 04:12:11.319 align:start position:0%

04:12:15.109 --> 04:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
Association does not this bill oh that's
 
04:12:16.910 --> 04:12:16.920 align:start position:0%

04:12:21.389 --> 04:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:24.389 --> 04:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
it they uh they they tried to block me
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the um $2 filing fee
 
04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
saying that would have a fiscal for
 
04:12:29.950 --> 04:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
State reps having it would have a fiscal
 
04:12:31.870 --> 04:12:31.880 align:start position:0%

district 6 wolfboro and Tuftonboro I am
 
04:16:40.950 --> 04:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
here to present House Bill 1584 relative
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
to home daycare licensing and the idea
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
for this legislation was presented to me
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
as a possible way to increase access to
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
child care without taxpayer funding um
 
04:16:53.349 --> 04:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
and this is actually kind of personal
 
04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
for me because my daughter is using one
 
04:16:58.109 --> 04:16:58.119 align:start position:0%
of these situations because we could not
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
find daycare for my granddaughter in our
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
own community in fact she's been on the
 
04:17:04.870 --> 04:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
waiting list for over a year they just
 
04:17:06.269 --> 04:17:06.279 align:start position:0%
called her recently and said would you
 
04:17:08.109 --> 04:17:08.119 align:start position:0%
like to contining she said just forget
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
it um so this is
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
really increasing access to daycare is
 
04:17:14.710 --> 04:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
really important and I'm acutely aware
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
of this situation so it's obviously
 
04:17:19.229 --> 04:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
unnecessary for me to delve too deeply
 
04:17:20.550 --> 04:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
into it because that's why your
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee is formed um but this bill
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
amends RSA
 
04:17:29.790 --> 04:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
17-e colon 3 Roman numeral 1 C by
 
04:17:31.830 --> 04:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of children that
 
04:17:34.750 --> 04:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
who can be cared for in a private home
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
in addition to the PRI providers own
 
04:17:40.349 --> 04:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
children from the three children to four
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
children this RSA is in the exemption
 
04:17:45.510 --> 04:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
section of the child care licensing
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
statute um the ratio of providers to
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
Children is not affected by this change
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
as the providers are not a licensed home
 
04:17:56.590 --> 04:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
daycare um the minimum of ratio for
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
infants in a licensed setting I believe
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
is 1 to three and a home daycare has the
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility to determine the ages of the
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
children he or she is willing or able to
 
04:18:10.149 --> 04:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
care for um as well as setting their own
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
limit up to a Max maximum of four
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
children should this bill pass um there
 
04:18:17.950 --> 04:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
are benefits to a home daycare setting
 
04:18:20.189 --> 04:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
that representative D Simone just spoke
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
to a few minutes ago you flexibility
 
04:18:26.349 --> 04:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
nights evenings weekends those kind of
 
04:18:30.030 --> 04:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
things um I also see a huge benefit um
 
04:18:32.830 --> 04:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
to home dayare as someone who wasn't
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
always a personal fan of daycare um when
 
04:18:37.790 --> 04:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
my own own children were in daycare I
 
04:18:40.189 --> 04:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
chose a s a setting that was more
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
similar to what they would have
 
04:18:44.950 --> 04:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
experienced at home so multiple children
 
04:18:46.830 --> 04:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
of different ages in a setting where
 
04:18:49.229 --> 04:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
they could you know learn not just from
 
04:18:51.070 --> 04:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
their peers but from older children
 
04:18:53.469 --> 04:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
which not not always the best but
 
04:18:57.510 --> 04:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes it works um uh so but the
 
04:18:59.950 --> 04:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
children are in a home and that's really
 
04:19:02.670 --> 04:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
important to me um and but they can
 
04:19:04.389 --> 04:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
possibly see family interactions and
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
typical events that occur in a home such
 
04:19:09.030 --> 04:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
as cooking laundry chores Etc I know my
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
granddaughter gets to see her friend
 
04:19:12.630 --> 04:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
Maddie get off the bus every day when
 
04:19:15.109 --> 04:19:15.119 align:start position:0%
she comes home from school and stands
 
04:19:17.149 --> 04:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
outside waiting for her so it's kind of
 
04:19:20.189 --> 04:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a kind of fun uh so this could
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
be a more convenient location also for
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
parents as pickup and drop off add to
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
the work commute you know if the only
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
child care center is 30 minutes the
 
04:19:31.469 --> 04:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
other direction from work now you've got
 
04:19:33.149 --> 04:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
a commute of an hour on either end of
 
04:19:36.030 --> 04:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
the day and we all know that that extra
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
time could be spent doing spent in more
 
04:19:42.389 --> 04:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
valuable ways with your own children um
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
maybe the CH child or the parents are
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with a family member or
 
04:19:49.590 --> 04:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
a friend that they know um and it might
 
04:19:52.630 --> 04:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
also be offered a more already said that
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and it could be less expensive my um
 
04:19:57.790 --> 04:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
daughter's daycare is less expensive
 
04:20:01.269 --> 04:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
than the local children's center um and
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
the downsides you know parents need to
 
04:20:06.229 --> 04:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
do their own homework to vet the inhome
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
day care and ask the right questions and
 
04:20:10.269 --> 04:20:10.279 align:start position:0%
I in preparing for this I asked my
 
04:20:11.950 --> 04:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
daughter I said what what questions did
 
04:20:14.149 --> 04:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
you ask and she said I probably should
 
04:20:16.349 --> 04:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
have asked a few more but so we went
 
04:20:17.870 --> 04:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
through the list of questions she would
 
04:20:19.630 --> 04:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
should have asked and it's all turning
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
out fine but you know looking back she's
 
04:20:24.550 --> 04:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
young and didn't really wasn't fully
 
04:20:26.590 --> 04:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
aware of all of the questions she should
 
04:20:29.910 --> 04:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
be looking into um and then if the
 
04:20:32.109 --> 04:20:32.119 align:start position:0%
provider is ill or has appointments that
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
might mean time off work for the parent
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
you know you have to find find somebody
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
else to care for the child and that
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
happened to me this morning and I said
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
nope I have to be here to vote today so
 
04:20:44.269 --> 04:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't help you out so I hope you
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
consider supporting House Bill 1584 as a
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
simple non- taxpayer funded way to
 
04:20:52.269 --> 04:20:52.279 align:start position:0%
increase access to child
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
care okay uh will you be taking

record I'm representative Margaret dry I
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
serve Sullivan district 7 uh Newport
 
04:21:22.030 --> 04:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
Unity Charlestown planfield and
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
Cornish and I'm here today um for a
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons well one I'm on the
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
education committee so we hear uh child
 
04:21:32.950 --> 04:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
care as a coraly to a lot of the um re
 
04:21:36.109 --> 04:21:36.119 align:start position:0%
um Recruitment and retaining uh of not
 
04:21:39.790 --> 04:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
only teachers but also staff and uh in
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
the last few months I also served on the
 
04:21:44.590 --> 04:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
commission for hospitality and tourism
 
04:21:46.950 --> 04:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire it was a
 
04:21:49.870 --> 04:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
commission um meant to to figure out
 
04:21:52.429 --> 04:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
what we do in the state and again uh
 
04:21:54.750 --> 04:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
Child Care and housing came up as
 
04:21:56.910 --> 04:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
corollary problems to expanding the
 
04:21:59.710 --> 04:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
tourism and the hospitality industry so
 
04:22:03.149 --> 04:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
um this bill seemed like um uh one of
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
the pieces of the puzzle it's a there's
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of pieces in solving the puzzle
 
04:22:09.070 --> 04:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
but this might be an easy one to put in
 
04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
to into circulation second is I my
 
04:22:14.990 --> 04:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
husband and I raised nine children and I
 
04:22:17.149 --> 04:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
always got this question how did you do
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
that and my answer is always one at a
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
time and uh and that's kind of how this
 
04:22:27.030 --> 04:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
is Sol attempting to solve this problem
 
04:22:28.990 --> 04:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
moving from three to four children I
 
04:22:31.109 --> 04:22:31.119 align:start position:0%
found personally isn't you're already in
 
04:22:34.630 --> 04:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
zone defense at that point and so adding
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
one more isn't that hard to do and um
 
04:22:41.349 --> 04:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that would have been um been
 
04:22:43.790 --> 04:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
helpful in our town in planfield over
 
04:22:45.109 --> 04:22:45.119 align:start position:0%
this weekend I don't know if you read
 
04:22:48.109 --> 04:22:48.119 align:start position:0%
that the the Campbell Union Academy uh
 
04:22:49.710 --> 04:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
Child Care had to be closed because of
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning they found some sick
 
04:22:55.030 --> 04:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
children and uh and close that now that
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's for the faculty the staff and
 
04:22:59.790 --> 04:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
community members so all of a sudden
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
there's a big need in my town and if
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
this this um was ready this you know
 
04:23:08.590 --> 04:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
reserve of an extra space in some
 
04:23:10.149 --> 04:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
people's homes they may not have filled
 
04:23:11.950 --> 04:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
it at that point that might have helped
 
04:23:14.070 --> 04:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
to solve I know a lot of families that
 
04:23:16.349 --> 04:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
this weekend had a big scramble so
 
04:23:18.109 --> 04:23:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking you to support
 
04:23:20.349 --> 04:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you excellent will you
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
be taking questions from the committee
 
04:23:24.189 --> 04:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely sure are there questions from
 
04:23:24.199 --> 04:23:24.870 align:start position:0%
absolutely sure are there questions from
the

04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you okay

last pink card that I have um is uh Jan
leir

04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:45.070 --> 04:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
shocking that you're seeing me again I'm
 
04:23:48.550 --> 04:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
sorry Jen leer exitor New Hampshire
 
04:23:51.910 --> 04:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
um I my one concern about this as I do
 
04:23:53.550 --> 04:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
kind of go through the licensing process
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
pretty regularly is that um the fire
 
04:23:58.870 --> 04:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
codes and I'm reading them right here do
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
only allow for three children in um
 
04:24:04.830 --> 04:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
Family Daycare homes that are not
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
related so
 
04:24:09.149 --> 04:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
this kind of becomes a fire code related
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
issue and are there waivers that have to
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
kind of come into fire code for this in
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
conversations with them they're because
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
a family child care that's licensed
 
04:24:20.349 --> 04:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
exempt like this doesn't have to go
 
04:24:21.950 --> 04:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
through zoning and they don't have to go
 
04:24:24.070 --> 04:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
through the regulatory sign off in these
 
04:24:27.149 --> 04:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
processes so bringing in four children
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
would they probably wouldn't even be
 
04:24:31.070 --> 04:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact that they were not
 
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
following fire codes um because there's
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
no checks and balances for a license
 
04:24:37.309 --> 04:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
exemption Center so it would follow the
 
04:24:39.269 --> 04:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the owner of that
 
04:24:41.630 --> 04:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
particular license exemp center to to
 
04:24:44.349 --> 04:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
follow the fire code so I think it it
 
04:24:45.910 --> 04:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
opens them up to
 
04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
liability if we're not following the
 
04:24:52.349 --> 04:24:52.359 align:start position:0%
fire code and it's a a selfcheck in
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
balance that they're responsible for
 
04:24:57.870 --> 04:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's a lot like you know our staff who
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
can't manage their money right that we
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
were talking about an earlier testimony
 
04:25:04.950 --> 04:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
um so I have some reservations about
 
04:25:08.750 --> 04:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
this you know as as an owner myself so
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions from the
 
04:25:11.349 --> 04:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
committee absolutely are there questions
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
04:25:14.830 --> 04:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
cretians are recognized thank you chair
 
04:25:17.710 --> 04:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
might have almost been a question for
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
the previous uh testifier who said one
 
04:25:24.750 --> 04:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
at a time um I'm a little concerned that
 
04:25:26.510 --> 04:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
this doesn't have any information in it
 
04:25:28.830 --> 04:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
about the ages of the additional
 
04:25:31.990 --> 04:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
children who are cared for um do you see
 
04:25:34.510 --> 04:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
that as a as a problem with your
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
experience um yeah I mean in family
 
04:25:39.670 --> 04:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
child care there's you know ratios from
 
04:25:41.469 --> 04:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
childcare licensing perspective you can
 
04:25:42.910 --> 04:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
only have two children under the age of
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
two with no regulation because of
 
04:25:49.109 --> 04:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
ability to evacuate you know the Melissa
 
04:25:50.309 --> 04:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
will tell you you know it's two children
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
under the age of two so if you're
 
04:25:52.750 --> 04:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
getting out of the building it's one
 
04:25:54.510 --> 04:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
child here one child here and you walk
 
04:25:57.030 --> 04:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
out the door with two children in a
 
04:25:58.630 --> 04:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
licensed exempt setting you wouldn't
 
04:26:01.389 --> 04:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
have that regulation where you could say
 
04:26:03.229 --> 04:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
you know only two children under two so
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
it could be um all four infants it could
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
all school agers I mean who who knows um
 
04:26:13.349 --> 04:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
so I do think that if it's not
 
04:26:16.030 --> 04:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
regulated correctly there could be some
 
04:26:18.269 --> 04:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
safety concerns that evolve here I mean
 
04:26:20.590 --> 04:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
we have four infants in a license center
 
04:26:22.389 --> 04:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
but we have evacuation cribs and there's
 
04:26:24.910 --> 04:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
extra staff members even if we went to
 
04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
four infants in a a a family care home
 
04:26:29.550 --> 04:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
you would still have to have certain
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
procedures in place to be able to
 
04:26:33.389 --> 04:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
evacuate correctly but we're asking for
 
04:26:37.149 --> 04:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
these centers who are license exempt to
 
04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
follow rules that they don't have to
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
follow they're not even aware of them so
 
04:26:45.070 --> 04:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
I I think that's my concern is
 
04:26:47.229 --> 04:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
that yeah they don't even know these
 
04:26:48.990 --> 04:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
rules exist
 
04:26:52.590 --> 04:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay awesome um any further
 
04:26:56.309 --> 04:26:56.319 align:start position:0%

04:26:58.510 --> 04:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
