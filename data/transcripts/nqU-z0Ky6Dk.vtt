table and use the mic so we can hear
 
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
what you're saying clearly and
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
distinctly at the same time
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative Cole has a device to
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
capture what we're saying and I think
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
transcribe everything so as the clerk he
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
found the technology to do the job I
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
commend him for that so thank you there
 
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.469 align:start position:0%
commend him for that so thank you there
you

you
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
go so the agenda today is pretty
 
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
straightforward there's basically two
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
things on the agenda one is to hear from
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
the insurance department is
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
what oversight if you will what
 
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
Authority they have over the PBM
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
industry itself and basically asked um
 
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
Michelle Heaton to come forward I think
 
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
you have a presentation to give to us as
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
well and the second part of the meeting
 
00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
will be talking about maximum allowable
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
cost and try to understand the
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
terminology how it works in the
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
marketplace I've asked um pharmacist
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
Clifford to be here talk about this from
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
the State Medicaid Program because they
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
also have ma price how it works and for
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
us to begin to understand uh the nuances
 
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
to it so miss e if you want to take this
 
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.430 align:start position:0%
to it so miss e if you want to take this
away

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon my name is
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
Michelle he and I'm the director of life
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
and health with the New Hampshire
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
insurance department I've put together a
 
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
presentation that I think you guys all
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
have print outs of since we don't
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
actually have a presenting capabilities
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
here but it kind of goes over the um
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
Insurance Department's regulatory
 
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
Authority and explains how the
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
difference between tpas pbms and how
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
Managed Care works so if you join me on
 
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
um the second
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
page uh New Hampshire laws relating to
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
prescription drug oversight this is a
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
list of some of the chapters and
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and administrative
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
bulletins that all relate to either the
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
regulation of um Pharmacy benefit
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
managers pbms third party administrators
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
or um prescription drugs so there are a
 
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
number of different provisions and it
 
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
gets complicated when you're trying to
 
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
figure out what we're talking about so
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm going to start walking
 
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
you through what some of this stuff
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
means so if you go to the next page um
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
number three what is a TPA a TPA is a
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
third-party administrator and those are
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
entities that provide administrative
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
support to an insurance company or
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
health plan pursuant to a contract so an
 
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 align:start position:0%
insurance company is the company that
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
designs the plan files it with the
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
insurance department we review it and
 
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
ensure that it complies with law
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
and then we would approve it to be sold
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
the TPA is a separate entity that the
 
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
insurer will contract with to do certain
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
functions so sometimes that's assisting
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
with claims Administration that can be
 
00:08:17.469 --> 00:08:17.479 align:start position:0%
um helping out with a subset of benefits
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
so sometimes it can be Pharmacy benefits
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can be mental health
 
00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:24.039 align:start position:0%
benefits and they can do a variety of
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
different things the contract that that
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
third- party entity has with the help
 
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
carrier is going to delineate what the
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are what the oversight
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
is we have a law which is RSA 402h that
 
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
regulates thirdparty administrators
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
thirdparty administrators must be
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
licensed and receive a certificate of
 
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
authority from the
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
department and there are certain
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
Financial requirements they have to file
 
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
annual reports they have to be solvent
 
00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day if they're
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
helping administer claims it's not their
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
money that they're using to administer
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
those claims it's the insurers money and
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
the TPA is just the entity that's
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
helping assist that but they don't take
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
on any of that risk associated with the
 
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
on any of that risk associated with the
insurance

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.509 align:start position:0%
insurance
product

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
um there are additionally in 402h
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
certain parameters of what tpas can do
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
and how that stuff works but we're not
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
get into too much of that uh the next
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
page number four is what is a PBM so PBM
 
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
or Pharmacy benefit manager is just a
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
subset of a type of a PB of a TPA so
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
they are thirdparty administrators
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
except that a PBM only is in the area of
 
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.790 align:start position:0%
except that a PBM only is in the area of
prescription

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
drugs so there's a separate statute that
 
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
regulates Pharmacy benefit managers and
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
that's RSA
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
402n and like tpas they have to be
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
registered with our department we
 
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
monitor Financial solvency and there's
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
also data reporting requirements that
 
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
they have to submit to
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
us however for both tpas
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
and pbms there's exceptions so generally
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
speaking the way we have defined PBM in
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
this statute under 402n is it's a person
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
business or other entity that pursuant
 
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
to a contract with a health carrier
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
manages the prescription drug coverage
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
for the health carrier or provided by
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
the health carrier so they're only
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
dealing with that one as aspect of the
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
insurance contract they do not include
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities Health Care
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
Professionals licensed in the state
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
Consultants working um either with a
 
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
pharmacy benefit manager or a Carrier
 
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
Services provided by CMS or Medicare or
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services and it does not
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
include a health insurer so a health
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
insurer sometimes can have its own PBM
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
that is fully owned by the insurer but
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's maybe a technically a separate
 
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.949 align:start position:0%
it's maybe a technically a separate
legal

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
entity to the extent that PBM is working
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
for the insurer they are do not qualify
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
within our definition as a PBM and would
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
not be subject to this registration
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
requirement attorney heon do you want us
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
to ask questions along your journey or
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
do you want us to wait until the end no
 
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
feel free to jump in okay so I want to
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
follow up on that comment about the PBM
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
that's owned by the insurance company so
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
at that point in time they're not
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
licensed by the state because if I
 
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly the insurance
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
company that owns them is the one that's
 
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
licensed yes so therefore if that's the
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
case how does the insurance department
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
regulate the pvm they're not necessarily
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
regulating that separate entity they're
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
and we'll get to this so let me go ahead
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
a few and then I'll come back to that
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay um so going to the next slide
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
whether something qualifies as a TPA
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
under our statute you you have to figure
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
out what specific Activities The Entity
 
00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:03.550 align:start position:0%
out what specific Activities The Entity
is

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
doing who is the entity Contracting with
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
and whether the entity is fully owned by
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
insurer those are the three factors and
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
even if they qualify as a TPA if they're
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
doing or I mean if they qualify as a PBM
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
if they're doing any activities that
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
could require them to be licensed as a
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
TPA or utilization review entity they
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
would also need to have those licenses
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
as well and that's where it starts
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
getting very complicated and that's why
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
you have to look at what what activities
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
are they doing who are they Contracting
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
with and who owns them to figure out
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
whether they need to register or not so
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
if you go to the next slide number six
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
that has the chart this kind of walks
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
you through a lot of those different
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
scenarios so um also in the PBM
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
statute it um you have to have a
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
contract with a health carrier and
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
health carrier is defined um Within
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
you're selling commercial insurance so
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
if you are a self-funded plan you are
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
not a health carrier so if there is an
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
entity providing PBM like
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
services to that self-funded plan that's
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
falling outside of the definition of PBM
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
in our statute however you do fall
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
within the definition of a TPA so you
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
would be regulated as a TPA and a lot of
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
the regulations for TB TPA and PBM are
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
very similar the only big distinction is
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
that pbms have more of that data
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement that tpas don't
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily have and there's various
 
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
reasons for that if I so did that help
 
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
it did I want to go back if I may to the
 
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.590 align:start position:0%
it did I want to go back if I may to the
previous

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
page and my concern is that if I heard
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
it correctly if the
 
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.550 align:start position:0%
it correctly if the
insurance

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
entity owns the
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
PBM you're not regulating the PBM
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
because it's owned by the insurance my
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
concern is if I understand the
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
market Etna owns CVS Mna owns Express
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
Scripts United Healthcare owns Optima so
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
therefore 80% of the market is not being
 
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
overseen by the insurance department
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
it's you're seeing the insurance carrier
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
but not the PBM under
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
it there's caveats to that so if
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
there're to the extent that PBM is doing
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
Services solely for the insurance
 
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:31.759 align:start position:0%
company they fall into that exception if
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
that PBM contracts with other insurance
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
carriers that they are not owned by or
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
self-funded entities then they can start
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
falling outside of those exceptions and
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
they would need to either um register as
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
a TPA or PBM or possibly both depending
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
on who they're Contracting
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
with so the question I would go back to
 
00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:55.949 align:start position:0%
with so the question I would go back to
is

00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
that are we talking about oright for the
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
part that's outside of their ownership
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
in other words if I'm
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
Edna and I'm looking at
 
00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:08.839 align:start position:0%
CVS but CVS has other agreements with
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
other organizations if you go sell the
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
plans and so forth are you overseeing
 
00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
all of CVS or only the part that is
 
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
outside of the parameters of Ed I think
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
too we have to think about what are we
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
trying to oversee here so we're
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
regulating The Entity or are we
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
regulating the underlying plan so that's
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
the next part the presentation so when
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about these license
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
requirements if you fall within you know
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
these definitions and you have to
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
register that means that entity as a
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
whole needs to register their financials
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at are for the entire
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
entity when we're re um reviewing
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
qualifications for the people on the
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
board for initial license or stuff like
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at the entire entity
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
so in that respect if you fall into any
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
of these definition that would require
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
you to register then the entire entity
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
is registered whether only a portion of
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
your um business would fall into Managed
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
Care laws and the other portions of your
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
business fall without so when we're
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
talking about regulating pbms and
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs we're really talking
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
about two different things are we
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
talking about the entity PBM its
 
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
financials and who owns it or are we
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the prescription drugs and
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
how they're being administered pursuant
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
to insurance contracts which are kind of
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
two different issues I think what I'm
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me is what I call
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
consistency so that all players are
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
treated equally and we don't have
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
caveats and car outs for this versus
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
that and so forth my concern is that the
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
insurance department doesn't sound like
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
it has a broad regulatory authority over
 
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
the whole pvm part of it depending upon
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
what class they're in what caveats they
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
have and that's my concern is that I
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
keep hearing the word registered but
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
still trying to figure out what is the
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight that you actually
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
have to be sure that what they're
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to be delivering is being
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
delivered number two if I have a
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
complaint where does that complaint go
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
because that was the other question we
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully get through it here is how
 
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
many complaints does the insurance
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
department receive on an annual basis
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
from pharmacies patients providers those
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
are things I'm trying to understand
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
because if there's no place for those
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
complaints to land and the place they
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
land doesn't have any regulatory
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
oversight accountability and hold them
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
accountable outside of the fact they
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
have registration I'm not sure exactly
 
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
what kind oversight we actually have so
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about regulating The
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
Entity as a whole they are registered
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
with us we review financials to ensure
 
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
solvency we ensure that their board is
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
made up of appropriate people um those
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
initial things to get licensed and then
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
renewals after that monitoring Financial
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
SOL SOL sorry Financial solvency
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
um that is their ability to operate as a
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
PBM in this state what they're doing as
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
a PBM then is pursuant to their
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
contracts so that was one of the things
 
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
to be a PBM you have to have a contract
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
you know with a carrier or a Health Plan
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
um and what they're doing as a part of
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
their activities falls into what's in
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
that cont contract if we're talking
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
about Commercial Insurance we have the
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
regulate how they're administering that
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
product but the person or the entity
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
that's ultimately responsible for how
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
that product is AD being administered is
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
the carrier not the PBM the PBM is just
 
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
doing what is in their contract with the
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
carrier so does the PBM have any fiary
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility back to the insurance
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
company or does it have any
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility for them fin
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
outside of saying well they have a
 
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799 align:start position:0%
contract with the insurance and the
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
insurance care is the one holding the
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
produci responsibilities or do we
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
actually have the ability for the PBM to
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
be held accountable because at the end
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
of the day they're the ones that I
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly are handling all
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
the money and I get nervous when people
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
handle all the money and there's no
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the person handling
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
the money so the carriers are
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for overseeing any third-
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
party administrator or PBM working with
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
them those entities do not assume any
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
insurance risk the carrier is
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying those claims and
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
is ultimately responsible for that in
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the contract is how the third party
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
entity or PBM is going to be reimbursed
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
and there's different models for how
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
that reimbursement is going to work but
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
the money is basically passed from the
 
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
insurer to the PBM PBM pay the claims
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
when they're doing claims in
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
administration if we monitor those
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
entities for financial solvy because if
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
there's problems with solvy we want to
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that gets addressed before
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's claims going unpaid and you know
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
money missing we don't want that to
 
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
happen um but at the end of the day if
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
something like that were to happen the
 
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
carrier is still ultimately responsible
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
for pay ensuring those claims get paid
 
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
whether they're using a third party
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
administrator a PBM or some other um
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
entity they' have to be a TPA because
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
you'd have to be licensed here but
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that assume the risk
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
and they're only administer uring the
 
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
benefits pursuant to their contract with
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
the carrier and usually that relates to
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
how um the benefits are laid out in the
 
00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:39.430 align:start position:0%
how um the benefits are laid out in the
insurance

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
policy thank you for that explanation
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
but I'll turn it over to my colleagues
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
questions well my concern is that which
 
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
is still don't clearly understand is
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
who's regulating the PM and the fiary
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
respon responsibility because at the end
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the day it's a question at that point
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
in time is that if they're the ones
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
controlling Pur strings if they're the
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
ones that are basically making the um
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
working on behalf of the insurance
 
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
industry you think there'd be some
 
00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
accountability back to the insurance
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
contract

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
in in the case where we have things like
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
that gets a little more
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
complicated but in general what I've
 
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
seen based on all the things we've
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
hashed over back at the uh Commerce
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
Committee is that the fiduciary
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the end is the
 
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.630 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the end is the
insurance

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
company for the most part now this CVS
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
slash eus situation or one of the other
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
two that one I still have questions on
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
because there vertically integrated
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole thing and I think
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
maybe if we concentrate on that area we
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
might get a better handle on what's
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
happening there because that's not the
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
typical situation like we have with the
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
other ones so could you go over that
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
once again all right let's let's just
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
use a real a real example if I have I
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
have a a Harvard Pilgrim and I need a
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
drug so I go to the
 
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.310 align:start position:0%
drug so I go to the
drugstore

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
drugstore
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh and I get a card I have a drug
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
card and I get it paid for I mean I get
 
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
you know whatever whatever rate they pay
 
00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
me for so there's a PBM and that's CVS
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
in this particular
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
case who
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
is now remember my insurance carrier is
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim it's not
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
Etna in that case is CVS as a
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
PBM has to make all of their financials
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility I'm not clear on how that
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
affects I mean we I'm not etus so I'm
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'm Harvard Pilgrim oh they have a
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
contract with Harvard Pilgrim and so
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim is responsible for the
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility for how CVS
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
behaves as a PBM for Harvard Pilgrim is
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
that correct yeah I I mean I'm hesitant
 
00:23:27.149 --> 00:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking fiduciary duty because I
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure who who we're talking about
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
duties with respect to but Harvard has
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
essentially then in your scenario sold a
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
product that is um representing it's
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
going to cover certain prescription
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
benefits it has then contracted with CVS
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
to help them administer those benefits
 
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day if CVS does
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
something outside of its contract with
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
Harvard then it's those parties need to
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
resolve that contractual dispute so in
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
effect that's the same as it would be
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
for any PBM SL insurance company as they
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
regulations is all of CVS acting as a
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
PBM regardless of who the insurance
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
carrier is which set of laws do they
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
have to obey with respect to the state
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
and I got the impression they would have
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
to all of it would have to be under your
 
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
purview so that's where it gets tricky
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
because when we're talking about well
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
which state of which laws if you're in a
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance product then they
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
have to comply with all of the insurance
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
laws applicable to that insurance
 
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
product regardless of whether it's a PBM
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
or a health insurer administering the
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
benefits when we're talking about
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
regulating the PBM the PBM is not
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
selling the insurance product they're
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
just administering it so technically
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
pbms are just complying with the
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
registration you know those typical
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
standard things because they're not
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
creating the the insurance product and
 
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
they're not responsible for marketing or
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
selling it and they don't hold the
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
insurance risk associated with it so if
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
if we keep going the presentation I
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
think some of these things will come a
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
little bit clear um so after the chart
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
that goes through kind of the various
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
how you would be registered we get into
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
um on page
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
seven um the fact that there could be
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
multiple things you have to register for
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
if you're doing any kind of utilization
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
review you have to be registered at a as
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
a utilization review entity unless
 
00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:27.559 align:start position:0%
you're ured doing your own utilization
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
um all of these entities are subject
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
except are no all of them are subject to
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
examination and audit and investigations
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
by the insurance com department so if we
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
think one of these entities is doing
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
something that's illegal we can go in
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
and investigate and examine that so
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's where we have we do have the
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
regular authority over these entities um
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned before tpas and pbms
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
do have um any ual financial reporting
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
requirements now the difference here is
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about entities there
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
health insurance is the regulated
 
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
product and health carriers are the ones
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
that develop those products and sell
 
00:26:11.399 --> 00:26:12.789 align:start position:0%
that develop those products and sell
them

00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
um and they're the ones assuming the
 
00:26:17.789 --> 00:26:17.799 align:start position:0%
risk so the way we regulate those
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
products is the health insurer comes up
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
with the product they file it with our
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
department we review the entire policy
 
00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:28.039 align:start position:0%
and product and ensure that it complies
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
with all state and federal laws then we
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
would approve it once it's approved they
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
can sell it to Consumers once it's in
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
the market and consumers have it we also
 
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
are monitoring how that plane is being
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
administered to ensure that not only on
 
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
paper did it comply with our laws but in
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
practice is the policy working in
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
accordance with all of our laws so
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's our Market conduct aspect to the
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
extent we get any kind of consumer
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
complaints or inquiries we would open
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
investigations look into that and make
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
sure um you know the plan is operating
 
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
the way it's supposed to so on the next
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
eight kind of goes into kind some of the
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
stuff that we
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
do we have to review everything before
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
it's sold once it's sold we we continue
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
to monitor it we're also looking at the
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
premium rates and that's where you know
 
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
the actuaries come in and make sure is
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
the rate they're charging actuar sound
 
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that the company is
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
not going over by um putting premium too
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
low we also need to make sure that
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
premium is not excessive so that's also
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
goes into part of the review in the
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
department we also are reviewing the
 
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
financials of insurance companies so
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
they have annual filings and they have
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
quarterly filings and we were monitoring
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
that on a constant basis to make sure
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
that these insurance companies are
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
solvent so that their money is there
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
when the claims come
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
in so moving on to the next one so when
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about well what laws are
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
there with respect to prescription drug
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
benefits there's lot a and depending on
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
what Market you're in depends on which
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
rules and laws apply so there's large
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
group small group individual and then
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
within the individual and small group
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
you have on Exchange and off exchange on
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
Exchange is what's sold on the federal
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
Insurance Exchange those are qhp or
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
qualified health plans and they have
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
heightened requirements that not all
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
plans meet so those are kind of like the
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
the strictest requirements there and
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
they do have stuff that is specific to
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
prescription drug and reviewing
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
formularies now where we do not have
 
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is when there are
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
self-funded plans government plans
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid Tri care so to the
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
extent a PBM is operating in one of
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
those markets for the most part as a
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
state there is no regulatory Authority
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
we cannot regulate something that the
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
federal government is already regulating
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
and then with Arisa we're preempted from
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of regulation in that space
 
00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:56.519 align:start position:0%
as well that's where we don't have
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily Authority it's not over the
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
entity we have authority over the entity
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's the activities they're doing that
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
fall outside our jurisdiction is where
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have the
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
authority so if you go to um number
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
10 this is where we start getting to
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
manage care so in New Hampshire health
 
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
and pretty much in the country health
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
insurance operates on a Managed Care
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
model so the idea is that this is your
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
HMO po plans you are in a plan and the
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
health carrier is negotiating with
 
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.430 align:start position:0%
health carrier is negotiating with
providers

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
um all kinds of healthcare providers
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals facilities drug companies
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
medical device manufacturers to get the
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
best rate they can for their covered
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
people and that's how they help mitigate
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
costs if they can negotiate better rates
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
then you're getting that discount by
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
buying their product that's how the keep
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
cost Dam that's how the model works so
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
um outside of prescription drugs you
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
know you have to go to in network
 
00:29:59.230 --> 00:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
providers those are providers that the
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
insurer has negotiated a contract with
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
they have come up with a contractual
 
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
rate for their services and that is how
 
00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:10.039 align:start position:0%
they're controlling cost pbms and
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs are doing the exact
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
same thing they're entering into
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
contracts to negotiate a better rate for
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
the people in those insurance plans at
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
the most basic level that that is mag
 
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
care and that's what they're doing so in
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
doing that you are steering your covered
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
people into certain places is because at
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the day you're responsible
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
for paying all those claims and you want
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure you're making the most cost
 
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
efficient options that are also quality
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
so that's why we have laws surrounding
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
that to make sure that it's not just the
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
cheapest option that you know people do
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
have access to medically necessary care
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
and that certain things are going to be
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
included in that attorney Eden please
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
yes um you brought up the word steering
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
interesting so so if
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
I'm CVS or camart again
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
follow Spears um comment about being
 
00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.990 align:start position:0%
follow Spears um comment about being
vertically

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
vertically
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
prevent the insurance which owns the pvm
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
which owns the pharmacy from steering
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
things internally to their own benefit
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
and not allowing the patient greater
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
that is in some respects the whole
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
purpose of Managed Care is to steer
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
patients to lower cost options so
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
there's nothing necessarily that
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
prevents them from doing that and that's
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
what you would see with traditional hmos
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
all the time it's you know a hospital
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
HMO that is requiring all their covered
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
persons to go within their hospital
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
system to manage costs so in that
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
respect it's very similar but in New
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do not have laws that
 
00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
understanding that we don't have laws in
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
that specific
 
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.909 align:start position:0%
that specific
area

00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:08.919 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
and as representative Merchant has
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
indicated this vertical integration of
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
CVS and Etna if I would have belonged to
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
Etna and I got steered of course to
 
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
CVS right down the chain and in some
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
cases these days to their drug right
 
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:30.039 align:start position:0%
because I think make a generic for
 
00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:32.870 align:start position:0%
because I think make a generic for
Humera

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
Humera
 
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
uh if let's say that drug was not it is
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
pretty cheap I mean cheaper than Huma
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
but let's say it wasn't and then in the
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
future it may not be would we have any
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
visibility that they were steering us to
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
drugs that were more
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
expensive would we have any visibility
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
whether we have control
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
consumers somewhat because there are
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
transparency laws that you could find
 
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
that out so there are that's the whole
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
push behind transparency we have
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
transparency laws here there's Federal
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
transparency laws that require
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
disclosure of certain things um as
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
Regulators we would be able to look into
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
that type of thing so those laws do
 
00:33:15.389 --> 00:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
exist for transparency yes would you be
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
so kind as to send those laws to the
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
committee so we can review those laws
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
yeah so um we're jumping ahead but our
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
second to last slide um these are two of
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
the transparency initiatives in New
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we have data currently
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
posted we're working on getting more but
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
it's a process some of the transparency
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
and coverage um laws are just becoming
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
effective and it's a matter of getting
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
all that data together cleaning it up
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
making it in Ausable so we're in the
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
process of doing that but these two
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
sites um the prescription drug cost and
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
utilization in New Hampshire is on New
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health cost and those are I
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
believe are the top 50 drugs prescribed
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
and you can see um utilization and price
 
00:33:56.669 --> 00:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
there we're working on putting more of
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
it together but can get you the specific
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
citations to transparency and coverage
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
we also have um some specific New
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire laws that um Le that are
 
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
transparency purposes one of them just
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
got passed in our last session I believe
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
it was s sp555 where we expanded some of
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
the transparency and data rep so that's
 
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
that's coming um we were collecting data
 
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
we are now be going to be collecting
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
slightly more data and we're in the
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
process of putting out guidance to to do
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
that and once we have that stuff we will
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
be posting it you know on our website
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
for the public but one of the things we
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
found when we were talking about 555 is
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
that maybe the list that's in there is
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the best list did you
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
and I was well we fix that in
 
00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:44.470 align:start position:0%
and I was well we fix that in
555

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
555
 
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.030 align:start position:0%
555
oh

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so it was a last we were in a
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and there's a
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
lot of back and forth but what it landed
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
on with I remember I don't remember that
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
the list was actually modified itself
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
was taken out but it was put back in so
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
it expanded um we got rid of some of the
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
stuff but we did expand what we will be
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
collecting as part of that okay I may
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
not have recognized that
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
so looking at New Hampshire Health cost
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
if I understand this a sort of a portal
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
and I've used actually a couple of times
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
myself when I've gone into the port
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
portal and I have a test that needs to
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
be done because the provider wants me to
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
get an MRI whatever it's going to be
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
blood work
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
it's actually very beneficial because I
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
can go to the portal I can look at and
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
say okay Hospital a is doing this
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hospital B is doing this I can actually
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
see the price points by each facility so
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
if I'm a patient now and I got a
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
prescription in my
 
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
hand where do I go to find out where
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
that price is based upon the the
 
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacy the pvm and so forth how do I
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
know the again
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
transparency is how do I know as a
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
right now and I'm not up to speed on all
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
the things there are some sites out
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
there that help do this we are in the
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
process internally at the New Hampshire
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
insurance department of coming up with
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
ways to make this information more
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
accessible there is transparency and
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
coverage Provisions that are coming into
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
place that will help with that um it's a
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
matter of implementing those um those
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
changes there are also um requirements
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
for advanced
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
eobs um so
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
so I'd have to look into that a little
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
bit more but there are websites and
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
there are projects in development that
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
will help consumers do that because I
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
day and carriers can answer for
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
themselves but you want that's a lot of
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
Health Care and Health Care spending we
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
want people to start shopping around and
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
see yes this is more convenient for me
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
but it actually it's costing every it's
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
costing you know $200 more if I go a
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
little bit further I can go here and get
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
this for a lot cheaper if consumers were
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
more Savvy in that way we could help
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
bring down health care costs as a whole
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
if we bring down healthc care costs as
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
the whole premiums go down in theory I
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
think right now it's more making them
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
not go like this and more like this you
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
know um I don't think I don't know we'll
 
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
see I don't know that they'll go down
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
but we want to try to stop the Steep
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
increases of Health um Health Care
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
spending generally prescription drug is
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
one of those that keeps going up at a
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
higher rate so there's a lot of options
 
00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of ideas out there about how to
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
best cut down on this I don't think at
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
this point in time anyone has found the
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
solution that's going to work for
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
everyone everyone is trying to implement
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
when I say everyone I'm talking about
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
different states are trying to implement
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
different laws and requirements with the
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
goal of trying to bring down these costs
 
00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:57.079 align:start position:0%
but some of them are new and we haven't
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
seen how those are going to play out
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
some of them are a little bit older but
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
they have not necessarily seen those
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
cost savings they were looking for so
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
it's something that everyone is working
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
on and we're trying to figure out ways
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
of doing that but to your point I think
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
giving people that information is the
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
hope that people who become more healthc
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
care Savvy more consumer Savvy start
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
looking these things up will be able to
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
help you know realize the cost of these
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
health care services and then that could
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
cause them to um behave differently for
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
the sake of everyone easier said than
 
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
done thank you for that I'm going to
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
date myself here but when I started
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
practicing Pharmacy one of the things we
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
had to do was to post the top 200 um the
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
prices for each one of those
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
prescriptions again why we did that was
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
because the law required it and why did
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
the law required is bring in
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
transparency to the patient so the
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
patient going walk into the pharmacy
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
know what the price point was before
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
they actually bought the prescription
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm trying to get to
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
here as a patient today I have no
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
clue what I'm going to be charged I
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
don't know where to go I don't have any
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
portal to go to there's no commonality
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
to it the price points are all over the
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
place I'll talk about this later in the
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
Mac environment I had a patient not
 
00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:15.630 align:start position:0%
Mac environment I had a patient not
myself

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
but there was a pharmacy same
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
PBM same day same drug three different
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
prices and as a patient how do I know
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm talking to the choir right
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
now but I think we need to figure out
 
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
how we can get the information out to
 
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
the public and help the patient
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
understand what's there yeah and that's
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
definitely something we're working on
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
there have been recent changes in
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
federal law and transparency and
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
coverage they're just you know getting
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
to that point of being implemented so I
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
think you know in a few years this stuff
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
will be more readily accessible it's
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
just it's a matter of implementing that
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
it now and I think I don't know for
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
curies they can answer for themselves
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
but um it I'd have to look into it more
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
but I think if the person called their
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
insurance provider they should be able
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
to provide them with some of that
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
information because the insurance
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
carrier knows what the prices are
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
everywhere because they've negotiated
 
00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm again saying the same thing is as
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
three different patients one in the same
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy same drug same PBM and had
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
three different prices
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
so when I call in what price do I get
 
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
the one I'm supposed to get somebody's
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
going to get I'm saying it's very
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
complicated it's very convoluted but
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
what I keep going back to is on page
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
eight when you talk about regulated
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
industry you regulate the
 
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
product which is the insurance yes
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy benefits and insurance so how
 
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
are you regulating the pharmacy benefit
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
insurance so Pharmacy benefits um when
 
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about individual and small
 
00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
group they are in a such health benefit
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
they are part of the health insurance
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
plan they are not a separate coverage it
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
is all part of your major medical
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
insurance plan
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
however that might not be obvious to
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
people because sometimes that
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
prescription drug piece is farmed out to
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
a PBM so people think it's two different
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
entities but it's not it's all part of
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
your major medical coverage so it falls
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
into manag care law all of those laws
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
apply especially in the individual and
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
small group when we're talking about
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
large group it gets a little bit
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
trickier because we're talking about um
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
employer benefit plans so they do have
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
some more flexibility to pick and choose
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
different aspects and they may have a
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
standalone prescription drug plan that
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different but a lot of
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
those laws still apply to prescription
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
drug plans so it it depends what type of
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
product you're talking about but for the
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
most part individual small group plans
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
um you would have to comply with all of
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
the Managed Care laws and um if you're
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
being sold on Exchange you also have to
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
comply with the qhp law so if we keep
 
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
going um I'm losing where we were even
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
at uh number 11 page 11 is the list of
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
and these are the ones that are really
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
specific to prescription drugs um and it
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
I've kind of tried to um delineate which
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
they apply to so 420j those ones apply
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
to all markets that's Managed Care laws
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
15 RSA 156 those ones apply to
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
individual and 41518 ones those are
 
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
group 415 26 and 27 those apply to all
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
markets and then the federal law the 45
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
CFR there is applicable to on Exchange
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
those qhp
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
plans so when I look at on this list I
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
see it applies to all markets that
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
include self-funded no because that's
 
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.870 align:start position:0%
include self-funded no because that's
not

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.710 --> 00:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
so so we're just talking about the
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance that the state
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
regulates but the state has the
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
authority not so much in the plan design
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
but in the economics of it according to
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
rutage they have some saying what goes
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
on with the pvm side of the equation so
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
what are we doing on the economic side
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
versus the planet
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
side I'm not sure I'm following
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
question if you look at other states
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
like Arkansas they have actually gone
 
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:28.839 align:start position:0%
into looking at the economics and the
 
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
cost and so forth within the pvm world
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
and that was decided by the Supreme
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
Court en rollage so I understand plan
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
design is off the table that's un
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
covered through Arisa because that's
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
really the insurance but what are we
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
doing the state to help out looking at
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
the economics and the cost structure
 
00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
within the PBM World who's overseeing
 
00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
that to some extent we
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
are can you explain to what means we say
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
some extent be kind of vag within the
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance department we
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
have a data analytics team we are also
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
charged with doing the annual hearing
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
every year where we're looking into cost
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
drivers so when we're doing those
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
projects we're looking at the cost
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
drivers in the health insurance Market
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
globally and we also you know look at
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
how much of the market is commercial
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
what's Medicare Medicaid where what are
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
the size of these markets what are the
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
um overlying also with the um the state
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
employee plan they opt into the chis
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
data so we're looking at those chis out
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
of Trends and health costs we are
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
looking at more than just the commercial
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
Market generally when you're talking
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
about what some other states did in
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
Rutledge rutage related to the way a PBM
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
can operate in
 
00:44:44.549 --> 00:44:44.559 align:start position:0%
filling prescriptions I believe and I'd
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
have to look back and that was specific
 
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
to how a PBM operates it was not
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
specific to plan benefits and that's why
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
it was not preempted by Arisa when we're
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
talking about the plan benefits and the
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
structure of how those are provided
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
that's where the commercial insurance
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
the insurance department regulates it or
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
if it's aissa preemptive then it would
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
be the employer that um decides how
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to be
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
done if I can go back um in regards to
 
00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:20.559 align:start position:0%
Arkansas it's how the PBM operates it's
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
not about the plan design yes so what
 
00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
are we doing on the PBM operations in
 
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to have some
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
operations I mean none of our laws they
 
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
operate pursuant to their contract so
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
other than that we don't necessarily
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
have laws I
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
mean to the extent that the PBM was also
 
00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy you would have to comply with
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
that to the extent you're you know um a
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
wholesaler or something like that you
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
would have to apply with comply with you
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
know those Pharmacy laws but as an in as
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
a PBM entity
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
we don't tell them how they have to
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
operate other than you have to be
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
financially solvent and you have to you
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
know follow what's in your contract to
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
the extent they're um operating in the
 
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
space of commercial stuff then they
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
would have to comply with insurance laws
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
but that would also be part of their
 
00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
contract you can't contract way you know
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's legally required so there you know
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
prompt pay for example is one of the
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
laws we have where you have to
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicate clean claims within a certain
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
number of days if they are you know
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicating those claims they would
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
have to follow that law so that's kind
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
of the extent of what we do for how they
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
operate um I'm not sure like what what
 
00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
what are you thinking that we should be
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
regulating I guess well part of it can
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
be as simple
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
as the frequency on which a payment is
 
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
done with a pharmacy it' be something to
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
do at that point in time with complaints
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
by the pharmacy or the community or the
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
patients and that's all about operations
 
00:46:59.069 --> 00:46:59.079 align:start position:0%
nothing plan design so at that point in
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
time is how they're operating I mean
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
when I think of this as another um sort
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
of a an example you have a general
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
contractor and they paid a bucket of
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
money and they subcontract it but every
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
single one the subcontractors also is
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
regulated and has meet
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
requirements they don't sit there and
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
say it's holy owned subcontractor I
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
don't need to worry about it if you are
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
subcontracting it out there is some sort
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
of compli some sort of vehicle that you
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
had to be held accountable to and it's
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
for the protection of the citizens that
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
the subcontractor is doing the work
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do even though
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
legally the general contractor is going
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
to have some responsibility to it as
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
well but there's also responsibility at
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
the subcontractor level so I look at the
 
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
relationship between the insurance
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
industry and the pvm this will up a
 
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
subcontractor and I'm looking for what
 
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.230 align:start position:0%
subcontractor and I'm looking for what
kind

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
kind
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
of regulatory Authority um what kind of
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
influence we have how do we look at the
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
operations how do we hold them
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
accountable and what do we hold them
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
accountable to so there are certain
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
operational requirements in our laws and
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
to the extent an insurer is
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
subcontracting or using a third party um
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
administrator in some fashion that
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
entity has to follow those laws and
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
insurers are required to go in and audit
 
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
those entities and have oversight of
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
that on an ongoing basis so it's not
 
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
something that you can just delegate out
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
and then have no oversight over they
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
need to be o overseeing all of that so
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
we do have that also to the respect with
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
respect to pbms in actual pharmacies
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
we're going for argument sake if we're
 
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
talking about in network pharmacies
 
00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
those pharmacies also have contracts
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
with the insurer so there are um certain
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
rights within their contracts with the
 
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
insurer um as in network providers that
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
they can Avail themselves of and that's
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
with complaint complaints that's with
 
00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:00.799 align:start position:0%
grievances contract negotiations um
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
timing of payments all that stuff is
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
typically going to be in that provider
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
contract so there are in some there are
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
contracts between the different entities
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
that are delineating a lot of these
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
things we do not necessarily regulate
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
what is in that contract for the most
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
part there are certain laws saying
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
provider contracts need to have XY and z
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
and as long as they have that the rest
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
of the details are up to the Contracting
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
parties to work out
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
so in the state of New Hampshire I
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
believe we have something called any
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
willing provider
 
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
law no we do
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
not yes we
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
do are you talking about for pharmacies
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
yes what I'm trying to get to if I have
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
an any willing provider law it says if
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to accept the contract I
 
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
should be able to take and build that
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
patient I don't have to say have a
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
contract or have the same contract with
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
the PBM because the reason for it being
 
00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:56.799 align:start position:0%
there is they give the patient the
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
freedom of choice which is very
 
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
important to us so at that point in time
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
how is the insurance department
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
enforcing any willing provider well if
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
there's and I'm not exactly sure that
 
00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what our law say is an
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
any willing provider I think there are
 
00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:15.559 align:start position:0%
parameters that are similar to that but
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I would classify it
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
but for argument sakes if it is any
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
willing provider then you're agreeing to
 
00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:25.559 align:start position:0%
accept the contractual rate so I mean
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what else it still Falls
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
with impr prompt pay so you would have
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
to submit the claim and you would be
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
assuming it's a clean claim you would be
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursed within that period of time
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
and you would be agreeing to accept
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
whatever that contractual rate was going
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure where would the regul
 
00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
like what more would we be regulating
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
we' be regulating to ensure that the
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
claims are paid in according in
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
accordance with the law uh we actually
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
have some people I think in the audience
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
that they're willing to come and speak
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
to us about this yeah my understanding
 
00:51:00.789 --> 00:51:00.799 align:start position:0%
is that they may not always have access
 
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
to a
 
00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
contract because under the Willing un
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
willing provide a law they should be
 
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
able to have access to it but a lot of
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
times they're not granted the access so
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
therefore they can't even Bill and take
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
care of their patients so I want to be
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
sure that they have the opportunity as a
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
provider to care for their patients
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
under that law and I want to be sure
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
that that law is being enforced so this
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
point in time as a patient I have
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
the right if you will to go to any
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacy I want
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
to even though it may be outside of
 
00:51:39.309 --> 00:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
network I may have to pay a different
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get to is
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
understand the patient rights here
 
00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
versus the pvm's rights does someone so
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else want can you speak your
 
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
friend here does someone know what law
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.750 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
here

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
Curtis give me a second yeah I'm not
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
sure if I'm understand your Mr chairman
 
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
ctis so we we do have a law that says
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
that um the carrier has to reimburse the
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
usual customary rate or um or the co-pay
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
whichever is less but that would I would
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
not say is an any willing provider and
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
we do have products that have in network
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy benefits and out of network and
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
then there's tiered networks where if
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah this is also specific to health
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance organizations hmos not
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily all insurance carriers so it
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
is a little bit of a cound so rips and
 
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
richion what I have here is RSA 420 B12
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay but if I'm understanding
 
00:52:59.230 --> 00:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're the point that
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
you're making um correctly and I may not
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
be keep in mind it's it the pharmacy is
 
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
still required to have a contract
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere right it's if they're not if
 
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have a contract for
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement patient can't come in and
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
expect to get their pharmaceu their
 
00:53:17.549 --> 00:53:17.559 align:start position:0%
prescription drug and have it covered
 
00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
under the plan it understand so
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
basically if they want to they can sign
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
the contract with the insurance of the
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
PBM yeah so therefore the PV should be
 
00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
willing to give them a
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
contract yeah well that sounds like wait
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
a minute I think the difference is if
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's going to be you know a certain
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
boilerplate contract if you're willing
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
to accept those terms then yes we can
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
contract with you but that does not mean
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
that that's the contractual rate because
 
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
they could be contracting with other
 
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and have different
 
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates so I think there is
 
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
Nuance here and I think this just says
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
that you can that contract it does not
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
say it's not an any willing provider a
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
true any willing provider you don't need
 
00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:04.839 align:start position:0%
to have that contract to be in network
 
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
or out of network it doesn't matter you
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
would just be able to go to whatever
 
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy you want and you would be able
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
to access that so some states do have
 
00:54:17.069 --> 00:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
those any willing provider provisions
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that's not exactly what is here
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
please if I am an outof Network Pharmacy
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
and I want to have a contract with a PBM
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
Curtis don't go
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
away and I want to have a contract with
 
00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.150 align:start position:0%
away and I want to have a contract with
the

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
PBM would the PBM say your volume is so
 
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
low that I don't think this contract is
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
going to work out can they make
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
judgments as to whether or not they want
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
to make a contract with someone based on
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
various you know money things and
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
management things yeah generally
 
00:54:57.309 --> 00:54:57.319 align:start position:0%
speaking it ensur is not required to
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
contract with any provider whether it's
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy or medical or a hospital it's
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
completely within the purview but you
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
have to meet Network adequacy
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
requirements you have to meet all of
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
these other things assuming you meet
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
those things then yes if you're um one
 
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
hold out and they had made their Network
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy requirements they do not need
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
you they do not have to contract with
 
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
you and there are no laws that require
 
00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
you to contract necessarily with anyone
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
assuming you meet those requirements
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
certainly and I I think if I may um that
 
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
goes to the previous point and the rules
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
specifically the church department rules
 
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
on network adequacy uh
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
2701 um and specifically 07 um and
 
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
06 so they had there are different tiers
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
for different densities of population
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
the further the more rural you get the
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
the lower the requirement but if an if a
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
specific plan is having a difficulty
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
finding in this case a pharmacy to serve
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
the rural area they're going to be
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
forced to reimburse at a higher rate to
 
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
entice somebody to serve the population
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
right that's the way it works so that
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
that's where the different rates may
 
00:56:12.029 --> 00:56:12.039 align:start position:0%
come in that make
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
sense can
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
I not
 
00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:18.039 align:start position:0%
yet good try
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
though so what I'm trying to understand
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
is the role the insurance department has
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
over the PBM operations because if the
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacy or pharmacist wants to have a
 
00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
complaint where do they go with it
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
where's the patient where do they go
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
with it at this point in time it sounds
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
like it's goes to no no man's land and
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
at that point in time if they're not
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
being held accountable operationally to
 
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
something to the
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
laws then what are we doing so consumers
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacies um providers they are all um
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
able to come to the department and file
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
complaint with our consumer services
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
even if it's a product we do not
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
regulate we do assist consumers in um
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
helping them navigate the system and
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
we'll tell them no this is not a product
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
we regulate this is who you will need to
 
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
reach out to again if it's in network
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
providers they should be working within
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
their um contract with their provider
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
reps to help figure out those issues
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes though that doesn't happen and
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
they do come to us and we will intervene
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
and help work out that situation for
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
them um so just to give you some stats
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
since January of 2023 so a little over a
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
year and a half
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
we've received approximately 68 consumer
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
complaints that in some way were related
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
to prescription drug um I'm I don't know
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
how many of those were necessarily
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
founded but that gives you an idea of
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
how many we get from consumers with
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
respect to um pharmacies in particular
 
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.039 align:start position:0%
we have rules and that's ins
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
274.00 6 is the complaint process for
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and we would um figure out if
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
is this something that we have
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over is it something that
 
00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:57.039 align:start position:0%
the Board of Pharmacy has Juris over
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
there is a mechanism for us to refer it
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
to them um under that process I I don't
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
think we've ever gotten a complaint but
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
I know for sure that we haven't had a
 
00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:09.799 align:start position:0%
complaint since 2022 prior to that I'd
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
have to do a little bit more digging I
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
just didn't have the time to look up
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
that data but I was at the department
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
during that time and my recollection is
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
that we don't we've never gotten a
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
complaint from a pharmacy question yeah
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that we had that came
 
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
to us in the Commerce Committee was we
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
go uh regarded the the idea that there
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
is a board where a pharmacy can bring in
 
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
a complaint and say the Mac price is X
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
let's say but we can't get it for that
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
even though they have a contract I guess
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
but we can't get it for that
 
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
price where is the PBM what is their
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
obligation to tell the pharmacy where
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
they can get it for the price that the
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
pharmacy is s saying that the PBM is
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
saying with the insurance company yay
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
verily that's the price if you am I
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
making that clear yeah and I would have
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
to look that up because I I remember
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
reading but I don't exactly know where
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
that is in the rules and statute there
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
is the requirement though that they do
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
pay the usual customary rate or the
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
co-pay whichever is less so that is
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
meant to help protect pharmacies on that
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
but yes there is I believe a mechanism
 
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
and I'd have to look it up and I can get
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
that back to yeah the bill specific
 
00:59:29.309 --> 00:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
specifically said that the pharmacy was
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
not given the information as to where
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
they could get that the drug for the
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
price you know so if we could find out
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
something about how that happens that
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism that would be good yes I will
 
00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
look that up and get it back to you
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
thanks one last thing in regards to uh
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
prior approvals which is back to the
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
operational side of the
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
equation my understanding is there's a
 
00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.789 align:start position:0%
equation my understanding is there's a
certain

00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
law that requires the patient to get a
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
certain amount of
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
medication prior to the prior approval
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
being processed if you
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
will so how many complaints have you had
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
with patients not being allowed to do
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
that look at this and saying 68 patients
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
over a year and give the number of
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
prescriptions that's that's H that's
 
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
minuscule yeah that's over a year and a
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
half and I mean I can't talk about
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
specifics but some of those could that
 
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't understand how they're
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
in network versus out of network or
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
preferred in network versus in network
 
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy work so they're questioning you
 
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
know the cost sharing or you know
 
01:00:39.549 --> 01:00:39.559 align:start position:0%
they're questioning the accumulation of
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
something a lot of we do get a lot of um
 
01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:43.870 align:start position:0%
complaints about
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:44.990 align:start position:0%
complaints about
[Music]

01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
um how the co- pays and um out of pocket
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
max is being accumulated and trying to
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
reconcile that with respect to being
 
01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
able to access drugs again going off my
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
memory um I do review pretty much most
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
of these complaints but I don't recall
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
ever getting a complaint like that we do
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
have a law um 40 420j
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
7-b that does put in certain prior
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
authorization requirements that um I
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
think it's a 48 hour prior authorization
 
01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.950 align:start position:0%
think it's a 48 hour prior authorization
and

01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
um yes there's the ability to get a
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
shortterm amount of the drug to hold
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
so attorney heeden thank you for being
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
here but I do have a deep I mean deep
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
concern that over this period of time
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
the lack of complaints that have come
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
into the insurance
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
department and it probably goes back to
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
patients and the pharmacist not
 
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
understanding what their legal rights
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
are and where to go with it but this is
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
really not speaking highly of the
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
process so I don't know what the
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
insurance department can do to try to
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
inform patients inform providers of what
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
they can do to how they can file a
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
complaint because over 2022 from the
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
pracy world hearing zero is concerning
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
to me with 68 from patients is even more
 
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
concerning given the number of patients
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
that are out there it goes back to my
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
deep concern about the role the
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
insurance department has over the
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
operational aspect of a PBM and how
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
they're functioning within our state so
 
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
that they're abiding by the laws that's
 
01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get to and thank you
 
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today I wanted to
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
turn it over to represent spere just on
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
that point though I mean we the
 
01:02:35.789 --> 01:02:35.799 align:start position:0%
department does do a lot of Outreach but
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
yes this is a consistent thing that
 
01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to break through and make
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
sure that people understand not just for
 
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs but health insurance
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
generally they understand how Insurance
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
Works they understand their rights under
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
the product if they have any questions
 
01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
to reach out to us that's what we're
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
here for to help those we do have a
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
whole Outreach division we have podcasts
 
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
we have uh we go to outreach events all
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
the time we try to do as much as we can
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
but you know there we's definitely
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
people we're still not reaching so we're
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
always trying to tell anyone if you have
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
any questions if you're unsure about how
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
your benefits are working if you think
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's a problem please reach out to
 
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
our consumer services because they can
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
help you navigate those
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
issues and all my time in the state of
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I have not received those
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for all you trying but
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just one person one patient one Cen
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
that hasn't fallen on my desk yet so but
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
trying my my last question is and don't
 
01:03:34.119 --> 01:03:35.589 align:start position:0%
trying my my last question is and don't
go

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
away getting back to this whole
 
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
relationship uh if I am a an insurance
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
PBM and that PBM also deals with do pbms
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
does CVS as a PBM ever deal with other
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh other pharmacies as a PBM would they
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
contract with another Pharmacy like R
 
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
Aid or something so I don't know about
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
CVS in specifically but yes pbms
 
01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:16.039 align:start position:0%
generally would contract with several
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
yeah Network pharmacies if you have a
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
contract with a PBM any pharmacy has it
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
has a has a written contract with a PBM
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
is that PBM required in any way to let
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
those pharmacies
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
know where they can get the drugs you
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
know getting back to that other bill
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
that I was talking about where they can
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
get the drugs for the price that they've
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
agreed to with the insurance
 
01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:46.839 align:start position:0%
company I don't know that I would think
 
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
that it should be in the contract but I
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
really don't know do you have an
 
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
answer on the Mac issue specifically I
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%

01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
today is the world of
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
cost and pharmacist Clifford if you
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
would be so kind as to step forward and
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
talk about how the state deals or
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
develops a Mac list and so forth I'll
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
try to be kind to you as well um so if
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
you could help us understand the Mac
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
world what does it mean how does it get
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
developed what the process is how does
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
the State Medicaid the if a service
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
utilizes the Mac list it' be helpful to
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
the committee to begin to understand the
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
process if you don't mind thank you okay
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
so I may have misunderstood your
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
question um that you sent ahead of time
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
so I thought the question had to do with
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
the uh Mac list being available publicly
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm prepared to speak to that I know
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
there are federal requirements on how a
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
Mac gets calculated and and I know um
 
01:06:59.789 --> 01:06:59.799 align:start position:0%
that there there have to be a certain
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
number of generic equivalents Pro
 
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
available so a Mac is only used on
 
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
generic drugs and there has to be a set
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
number of generics available so like for
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
example when a drug first goes generic
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's a six-month exclusivity period
 
01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
given to the first generic available so
 
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
during that first six-month period you
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
can't have a Mac price on on that drug
 
01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
drug because there's not enough choices
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
available to order I can get you those
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
specific details on the calculation I
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
just don't have them today um but you
 
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
had asked if our Mac list was publicly
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
available and currently our Mac list is
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
available to providers that sign up to
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
view it in the provider portal um but I
 
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
did talk with our Pharmacy benefit
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
administrator and they do have some
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
State Medicaid programs that they work
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
with that are publishing their Mac on a
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
public fa facing website so I put in a
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
request to move the New Hampshire Mac to
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
the public facing website and that's
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
being worked on I can tell you the the
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
frequency though um all of the drugs are
 
01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.590 align:start position:0%
frequency though um all of the drugs are
reviewed

01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
weekly and there could possibly be
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
weekly updates um and we so we have uh
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
we l published file that will be um
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
added to the public facing website and
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
we have a monthly file that will be put
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
on the public facing website and when we
 
01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
move it to the public facing website we
 
01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
will also put in our our Mac um review
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
request so when a
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacy contacts myself um and says
 
01:08:51.309 --> 01:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
that they can't purchase the drug for
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
that that price then we send them out
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
the Mac challenge form and that gets um
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
that that Mac price reviewed quickly for
 
01:09:03.199 --> 01:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
that that Mac price reviewed quickly for
that

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy um so it you know if it falls
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
outside the regular um sometimes it's
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
just a matter of the the drug price
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
updated and we haven't done our weekly
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
file update yet so because we only our
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
drug prices are updated weekly most phes
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
get price updates
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
daily so um but we do have a challenge
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
form and those are reviewed and if it
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
needs to be adjusted it gets
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
adjusted but Mac isn't the
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
only price that Medicaid uses so we use
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
a lesser of pricing logic so Medicaid
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
reimburses at the lesser of the NC which
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
is National Drug acquisition cost if
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
there's no NC available for that drug we
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
use the whack which is the wholesale
 
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
acquisition cost um but if there's a Mac
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
and the Mac is less it it pays at the
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
Mac if the pharmacy's usual and
 
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
customary charge is less then we pay at
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
charge but getting back to my other
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
question yes you have the data but do
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacies know where they can get the
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
price I don't know that we know where
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
they can get the drug for that price we
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
we have a contract with a um a drug
 
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.550 align:start position:0%
we have a contract with a um a drug
pricing

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
compendium and that's where the prices
 
01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
for the Mac come so when a pharmacy
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
challenges the Mac price and they submit
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
their invoice as part of that challenge
 
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
that can be recalculated for the
 
01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:58.990 align:start position:0%
that can be recalculated for the
pharmacy

01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
yeah well thank you for um Farm Clipper
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
for that information in regards to
 
01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:08.350 align:start position:0%
for that information in regards to
the

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
file because one of the things I wanted
 
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
to talk to uh Mr Curtis later on or
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
somebody is that I've been told to have
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
some documentation here
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
that there was a drug over the course of
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
a year had 177 price points
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to understand from
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Medicaid when you have a
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
price point on the Mac of the list if
 
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
you will is that consistent across all
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacies or is that depending upon
 
01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
some sort of relationship you have with
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy Pharmacy a guess One Price
 
01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy b gets another Price Pharmacy C
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
gets another price I mean is it really
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
consistent for New Hampshire Medicaid it
 
01:11:50.669 --> 01:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
is the Mac price is the price and that
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
price would be paid to all pharmacies
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
depending on how that claim
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know like I said we use a lesser of
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
logic so if the pharmacy's usual in
 
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
customary charge comes in lower that
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy would get their usual customary
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
charge now another Pharmacy might have a
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
higher usual and customary charge and
 
01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
their claim May pay at a Mac or whack or
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
naak but the price the price in the file
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
is consistent yes across all pharmacies
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay that's very helpful thank you
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a weekly file and a monthly
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
file what distinguish between the weekly
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
monthly uh it goes on price updates from
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
the drug compendia so if a drug had a a
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
change in their price that was listed
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
from the previous week and we need to
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
increase that price it would increase
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
sooner than rather rather than waiting
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
for the monthly file to update so if the
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
price goes down does it also go down yes
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
so so it's really the monthly file is
 
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
there provided there's no real changes
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the marketplace
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
his they is pretty stagnant for that
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
month and versus they weekly depending
 
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
upon Market
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
volatility correct
 
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
okay and how many challenges has the
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
one but that's for the fee for service
 
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
population and the fee for service
 
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
population is relatively small
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
you know if if there's a challenge with
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who's in a Medicaid managed
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
care that would go to the Medicaid
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
Organization okay thank you
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
y any other questions for Pharm
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
clippard thank
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
you the other one I wanted in your
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.229 --> 01:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
Curtis is looking at Mac prices
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
according to what I have here from a
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
sources the price points for Mac are all
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
over the
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
board and I'm trying to understand why
 
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
you would have the same
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
drug on the same
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
day in the same Pharmacy with three
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
different price points I just don't
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
understand that and number two is if I'm
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist trying to ensure that I'm
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
above water on the Mac list so when I go
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
to my wholesaler Mr Barry I can sit
 
01:14:31.229 --> 01:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
there and say to Mr wholesaler what
 
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
you're charging me is not sustainable
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
because I'm being told by my insurance
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
or my PBM that there's a price out there
 
01:14:42.189 --> 01:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
at this price point that I should be
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
able to buy it at so where is it and why
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
can't I do that but it sounds like the
 
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacy doesn't really have visibility
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
and transparency in what those price
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
points are so when I'm buying the
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
product I'm sort of behind the aball you
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
mic sure just state your name
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon my name is Sam Hol
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
with pcma which is National trade
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
Association for pharmacy benefit
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
managers uh so Mr chairman I'll take a
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
stab at your first question on the
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
various price points and Mac lists so
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
pbns do have various Mac lists depending
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
on the type of client and contract of
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy so say it's a a carrier or
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
a client that has um not as many lives
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
they might not get as a a higher
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement at the pharmacy so there's
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
one Mac list but say it's a carrier with
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of lives they will and it brings
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
more foot traffic to a pharmacy that
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
will have a different Mac list so there
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
are various reasons why there are
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
various Mac lists and I can follow this
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
up with all of you um but from our
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
perspective a pharmacy can a pharmacist
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
can look at a live Mac price through
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
portals so they can go to the portal my
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
question then is how
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
long is that price held for is it held
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
for a month 24 hours a week typically
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
mless change frequently uh it depends on
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
the PBM in the current market situation
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
there could be drug shortages there
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
could be supply chain issues but it does
 
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
change pretty frequently yes typically
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's seven
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
days typically yes so it could be less
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
than weekly in some instances yes it can
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay is there any
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just trying to put myself in the
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
shoes of the pharmacist trying to be
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
sure that what I'm trying to buy from
 
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
the wholesaler I've been told that the
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
wholesaler is major problem here but I'm
 
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
trying to understand with the wholesaler
 
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
if I don't know what my reimbursement
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
price is I can't hold my wholesaler
 
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
accountable so how do you help the
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacist understand what their price
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
point is so they can actually go to the
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
wholesaler and put leverage on the
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
wholesaler sure again pbms have portals
 
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
that they can access these Mac list
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
prices Live and then as far as the
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
relationship between a pharmacy and a
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
wholesaler pbms don't have insight to
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
that but if I understand it correctly it
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
can change daily change so therefore if
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
I go on to it look on Tuesday my comes
 
01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
in on Thursday I don't know if I'm going
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
to be above or below the water because
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
the price point on Thursday will be
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
different than the price point on
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
Tuesday when I went to look for my order
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
into the wholesaler I I understand I
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
hear you and I hear that frustration but
 
01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that is what we use to make sure
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
that pharmacies purchase drugs at um an
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
affordable price to keep prices low for
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
PBM clients I totally understand that
 
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
but there's needs to be some give and
 
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
take here between the pvm world and the
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
Mac world and also the wholesaler I've
 
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
got a pharmacist in the middle between
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
the two sure and I'm trying to figure
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
out how to help them run a business
 
01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely and my recommendation would
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
be the psos and wholesalers need to be
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
brought into this discussion is there a
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
whole another entity within the Pharmacy
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
space that's not in this room that I'm
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
aware of okay if I bring them in which
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
is fine they're going to tell me well I
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
don't know what the reimbursement is for
 
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist so how am I going to know
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
at this point in time if they're above
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
or below water I don't know how does the
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
wholesaler know your price points they
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
do so wholesalers also run something
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
called PSA Pharmacy Services
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
administrative organizations they
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
contract with independentes think of it
 
01:18:23.229 --> 01:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
like uh a group of pharmacies to uh
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
increase their purchasing power those P
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
so a group ofes will be under a psao
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
that psao contracts with the PBM on
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates yeah that same psao
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
also is a wholesaler selling those
 
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacies drugs at various price
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
points so my response back to you would
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
be a pharmacist could reach out to a
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
wholesaler and they would know they they
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
may or may not know they W know I hear
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
was saying I I lived in the space for
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
the last 40 years a pharmacy service
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
administrative organization which is
 
01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
psao negotiates a contract they don't
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
know what the PBM Mac is going to be
 
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
they don't negotiate the Mac all they do
 
01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
is negotiate the price with the PBM and
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from my own experience
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
and living in that
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
space let me understand the difference
 
01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
between the price and the Mac in your
 
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
sit in what you just described if I go
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
to my
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
wholesaler and I want to buy a generic
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
drug aspirin
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at the cost from the
 
01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
wholesaler and it's going to cost me $10
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
for a bottle of 100 which comes out to
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
10 cents per tablet okay that's my
 
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
cost I want to go to the wholesaler
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that at this point in time I can
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
buy it for at least 8 cents or even 10
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
to break even and I don't know where the
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacist is going to get the
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
information to be sure that from a
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
business point of view they're staying
 
01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.709 align:start position:0%
business point of view they're staying
home

01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm trying to get to
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
psao does not have they have the
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
wholesal information I don't disagree
 
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
that's true what they don't have is the
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
Mac information coming from the PBM
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's off the
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
table my response back would be the
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacists can or the pharmacy can take
 
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
a look at the Mac list and price at that
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
time and work with their
 
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
wholesaler and I I can't speak to the
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
relationship between a pharmacy and a
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
wholesaler no but you can speak to the
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
relationship between the pharmacy and
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
the PBM right and I just heard that we
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
could hold a price point for at least a
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
week maybe even two weeks that way there
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
they know during that period of time
 
01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:35.719 align:start position:0%
they can high movers they can buy the
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
product at a price point that's been
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
locked in for a two we period of time
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
maybe 30 days it's going to be some
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
point in time that they have some
 
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
Assurance to what that price point is
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
and if I heard it correctly on the price
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
point the price Point's all over to
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
place anyways because it depends upon
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
whe it's a big employer small emplo
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
employer I don't even know at this point
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
in time what my Mac price is going to be
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
even if you go into the portal does a
 
01:21:02.669 --> 01:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
portal tell me a large wholesaler I mean
 
01:21:05.229 --> 01:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
a large plan versus a small plan does it
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
differentiate that way they can see they
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
can view the Mac list for those pbms yes
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
for all the plans correct so every
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
single plan they can go in and see the
 
01:21:18.189 --> 01:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
Mac price I'll follow up to confirm but
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding yes okay because
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
what I heard was in your statement that
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
a large employer may get a different
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
price point correct and a small employer
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
gets a different price point so there's
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
various Mac lists that they can view
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
within the PBM yes and they will know
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
would you get back to me on that please
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely because I'm looking at this
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
and saying is that I'm just trying to
 
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
level the playing field to be sure at
 
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
this point in time whatever the Mac is
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
going to be and I'm looking at I think
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative um Cole I won't speak on
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
your behalf but I think part of it is if
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
it can be locked in for a period of time
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
so the person knows what it is and why
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
eight different Mac portals I mean if
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking operationally get back into
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
it if I'm in the pharmacy and place it
 
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
an order M and I have to go to a portal
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
and look at eight and I would say the
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
plans could be more than eight could be
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
all over the place I have to determine
 
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
which one of those plans is the one I'm
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
going to use as my average because I
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
don't know what my food traffic is going
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
to be that's what I'm trying to get to
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
is how do we ensure that the pharmacist
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
has some visibility into a Mac price
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's locked in for a period of time
 
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
and that they that point in time can
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
rely upon it and not have something
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
exchange such volatility it's changing
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis maybe even by the hour
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to understand I
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
understand because I'm looking at this
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
here and studies I've seen is they're
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
all over the place which is which just
 
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
said to me there are there's many Macs
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
many different lists and so forth
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's so complicated so difficult I don't
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
know how anyone can make any any logic
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
out of it I I understand chair Mr
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
chairman but from the PBM perspective
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know we contract with pharmacies on
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
quality and on price to make sure that
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
our clients can get drugs safely but
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
also at an affordable price as well I
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
understand the frustration on the
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
pharmacy side as well but again I we're
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
only talking about one side of the
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
equation between the PBM and the
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacy I still think with that we need
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
to bring in that other side between the
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and the wholesaler psao as well
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
if you can help me understand this side
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
and I can understand it well enough i'
 
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
be more than glad to bring in the other
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
side but right now I'm still not quite
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
sure I understand this side before I
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
bring him the other side and number two
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
if you could help me as well when was
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
time either Express Scripts
 
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
Kart aam RX with a pharmacy actually
 
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.510 --> 01:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
being the trade representative I don't
 
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
have any individual contracts because
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
what I've been told it's a take it or
 
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
leave it that they don't negotiate they
 
01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
basically say you can either do business
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
with us or not do business with us
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations so I would like to find out
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
from the trade
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
Association how often and how willing
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
are they to change their contract or is
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
it one size fits all and that's it
 
01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
because that's so important because you
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
keep going back to the contract keep
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
going back to the contract and you keep
 
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
talking about it being negotiated well
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
negotiating means the two parties sit
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
down and negotiate something if it comes
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
down to here's the
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
contract you can sign it take it or
 
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
leave it if you want to do business with
 
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
us there's a piece of paper and sign it
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't want to that's okay too I'd
 
01:24:43.709 --> 01:24:43.719 align:start position:0%
like to understand how much flexibility
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
do we have within the PBM world with the
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
Contracting CU that goes back to the
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
basis of the Mac price sure cuz I'm sure
 
01:24:55.149 --> 01:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
it's built into the contract we know
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
before working in the industry there was
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
gag clauses I couldn't even tell the
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
patient that they paid
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
cash it would be less expensive for them
 
01:25:07.229 --> 01:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
because there was contract language that
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
prohibit prohibited me from doing that
 
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
that's gone thank
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
goodness so I'm trying to
 
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on with the
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
mac's going on the contracts he keeps
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
saying they're negotiated if I can
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
understand this I'll be more than glad
 
01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
to have the wholeale come in understood
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay Gary yeah thank you based on the
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
bills that we saw in Commerce that's
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
only one part of it the problems that we
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
would that we were hearing about is okay
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
fine you've established a price where
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
can I get it for that price so it's not
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
just how often it's also okay fine where
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
we thank you please state your name hi
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
yes Margaret Reynolds with siga and
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
Express Scripts uh happy to be
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
here I'll start with Mac but I have a
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
couple of notes I took from the previous
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
presentation I'm happy to answer
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions on as well um I am not as
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with how of the lists or
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
varying lists we might have I will work
 
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
with Sam we will get you that
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
information um in other states as far as
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
Mac goes there are laws that say it must
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
be updated at least every seven days
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
that's our general practice but
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
certainly if a state says it must be
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
updated every five days we can do that
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's tighter but seven is our general
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
practice how me St I heard at least
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
every seven days correct correct do say
 
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
a minimum of seven days correct so
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
therefore if it's at least 7even days it
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
could change
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
daily no at least every seven days so it
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
could be longer so it needs to be within
 
01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.390 align:start position:0%
could be longer so it needs to be within
seven

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
days am I saying that
 
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
right I don't think
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
so I not the way the way I'm
 
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
interpreting this is that if this is at
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
least every seven days that means
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
correct but if you're doing it
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
daily that's still within seven days yes
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
I will say seven days is our general
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
practice that is what we do if it was
 
01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
less than seven our team would say
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
that's a very tight turnaround so seven
 
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
is our general practice but as a state
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
if you were to say should not be updated
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
within seven days we would wait for the
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
sday window or longer cor so we basic
 
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
want to try to think it through is that
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
we freeze it for a week that's all or
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
two or four
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm trying to get to there's a time
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
that the list is Frozen that's all okay
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
right now it's really not it's at least
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
every seven days which means it will
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
turn over every seven days but it can
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
turn over before
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
that we could come to an agreement on
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
that because I'm saying seven days is
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
our general practice but general
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
practice does not mean that that's okay
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
than not everywhere all the time correct
 
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
um and then as far as contracts go that
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
goes back to the Network aacy adequacy
 
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
conversation that was from earlier if
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
there's a pharmacy and there's not
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
another one within 20 miles and they're
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
the only game in town we certainly want
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
to negotiate with them to have them in
 
01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.350 align:start position:0%
to negotiate with them to have them in
our

01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
network but back to the psao
 
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
conversation if they are part of a
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
larger psao with 30 other pharmacies we
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
are now negotiating with that
 
01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
psao that affects all of the pharmacy so
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
that becomes harder to do independent
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
terms with an independent Pharmacy
 
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
because we're no longer talking to them
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
directly we're talking to a psao which
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
represents more
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacies um but no I mean we certainly
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
negotiate uh it just depends on the
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
network and ensuring that we meet those
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
Network adequacy
 
01:29:21.149 --> 01:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
requirements would you do some homework
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
for us sure I'd like to find out in
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire how many
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
contracts you've actually negotiated
 
01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:29.239 align:start position:0%
sure you mean truly negotiated not
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
it I can contact our Contracting team I
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
am not the person with that information
 
01:29:41.229 --> 01:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
homework um and then the only I
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say only because I'm sure I'll
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
have plenty to say but and when you ask
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
the question about the contracts and
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
negotiating the contracts it' be helpful
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
to understand what parts of the contract
 
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
are you negotiating sure is it not the
 
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
beginning date and end
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
date okay thank
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
you yes um and then one other point I
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to call out from the previous
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
presentation you were asking about a
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
portal for consumers to know what the
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
price is um and I don't represent good
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
RX but good RX does exist it's a website
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
you would put in the zip code and what
 
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
your script is the problem with good RX
 
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
is it is not reflective of what you
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
would pay under your benefit it is
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
reflective of what you would pay as a
 
01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
cash price or if you're uninsured or
 
01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
underinsured um so it there is a portal
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
out there that exists um but it would
 
01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
not tell you what your benefit is as a
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
sigma Express SCP Express Scripts
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
customer I can go to our insurance
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
website I can put in my drug that I'm
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
looking for and it will tell me what's
 
01:30:51.629 --> 01:30:51.639 align:start position:0%
in my network and what my outof pocket
 
01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
is but that's because that's catered to
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
my benefit so it wouldn't be for
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
everyone else to see what my price is
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
but I know what my copay is does that it
 
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
it helps actually I've used the portal
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
myself a couple of times so I understand
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
it completely okay um one of the things
 
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
that I would say about good RX is there
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
any cost of the pharmacy to use good ARX
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of I I'm I'm
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully there's pharmacists that can
 
01:31:21.149 --> 01:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
answer if they have to pay a fee to
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
access that but I know it's free to
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
consumers to just go on there and price
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
shop for the cash price well maybe we
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
have one of the pharmacists that are
 
01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.590 align:start position:0%
have one of the pharmacists that are
here

01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:31:34.109 --> 01:31:34.119 align:start position:0%
no um you want to get off the hot seat
 
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
don't blame you either um do you want to
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
finish your comments before I have them
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
come up and
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
speak I'm happy to answer any if there's
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions regarding Mac I'm I
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not an expert in Mac but I love
 
01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
homework so happy to take questions
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
back is it possible for PBM is set the
 
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
rates for a b we period and be done with
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
it for how long sorry two weeks for two
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
weeks what kind of pressure would that
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
put on
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
pbms I mean it's not our standard I
 
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
guess the counter to that is if the
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
price were to increase the reimbursement
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
were to increase on a drug then the
 
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacy would still be under for those
 
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
two weeks because it's not reflective of
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
the market dynamics right so we try to
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
update it so that every one knows and is
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
on a field but I I the points were made
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
earlier about being able to negotiate
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that they're getting that
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
price so point
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
taken thank you Mr chairman something I
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the last meeting but I have
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
to mention it again because I've been
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
around a while um and I don't mean to be
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
flipped but there's a statute on the
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
books that on this specific subject that
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
says the PBM shall review and make
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
necessary adjustments to the maximum
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
allowable cost for every drug for which
 
01:32:59.070 --> 01:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
the price has changed at least every 14
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
days and I'm smiling because it was the
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Independent Pharmacy
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
Association that said we're they're
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
changing it um not often enough it
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't change in the price of our
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
acquisition changes and they're not
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
changing the Mac price so that was not
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
that long ago that they said we're not
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
changing it often enough and now we're
 
01:33:22.109 --> 01:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
changing it too
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
often I'm struggling this I I think The
 
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
Sweet Spot would be rep and Cole sounds
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
like two weeks is a sweet spot because
 
01:33:32.189 --> 01:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
that's what we agree to is they have to
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
do it every two weeks so if we just
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
freeze it for two weeks and everybody's
 
01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
happy I can't speak for individual pbms
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
but I hope you understand and appreciate
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
the point that I'm making I hear the
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
point do you hear the my point as well
 
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
it was it was their Association that
 
01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
came in and said we're not changing it
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
often I mean right and just because the
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
Mac price is Frozen for two weeks
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you can buy it for
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
that absolutely SP so you got to have to
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
find out the b the problems we were
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
seeing in Commerce was yeah fine we've
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
got a Mac price here but I can't find
 
01:34:06.189 --> 01:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
any place I can buy it for that because
 
01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
you got a wholesaler on the other side
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
then that's going to be the
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
next audience to bring in and talk about
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
why the pharmacy can't find it at that
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
price makes sense um for
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
context I think it's at least indirectly
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
related to the con contract discussion
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
um between the last meeting in this one
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
I took a look at the pharmacy the retail
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
pharmacy licenses in the state of New
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um at the time I looked it up
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
there were 271 Retail Pharmacy locations
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire 199 of
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
those were chains so CVS right a
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
Walgreens includes hanford's includes
 
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
Walmart includes Target
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
199 uh 42 seem to be hospitals Health
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
Center institutions um nine were some
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
other maybe compound infusion um one
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
mail order which I think is pill pack um
 
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
and roughly 20
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
Independents so it 271 for a state of
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
1.3 million
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
people and my concern is going to be a
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
lot of times the independence because of
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
the ones that probably don't have a lot
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
of the muscle that the larger chains
 
01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.159 align:start position:0%
have I'm not I'll be sure everyone's
 
01:35:21.149 --> 01:35:21.159 align:start position:0%
treated equally I'm not going to focus
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
my attention stly one part of the market
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
but I'm looking at them specifically
 
01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that seem to be
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
having more of the issue than some of
 
01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
the other ones and I can share and
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
you've seen it now right a just get out
 
01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.870 align:start position:0%
you've seen it now right a just get out
of

01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy sure so what I'm saying this
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
Market was working so so
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically okay I don't I don't know
 
01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
yet of a PM that's fed for
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy but we could find one I'm
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
sure and I think we could agree that
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
right a is more than just a pharmacy
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
they're also a convenience store and I'm
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen any evidence that it's
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy reimbursement that drove it
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
into bankruptcy versus just maybe not
 
01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
great business decisions we that would
 
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
take a different
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
analysis understood but I also can look
 
01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
at the other ones on the other side of
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
the fence with Walgreens announcing 10%
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
closure CVS is looking closure and so
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
forth and I'm sure if the business model
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
was there and the pharmacy were vibrant
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be closing them and I
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
think you can look at every other type
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
of retail business because I used to
 
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
represent the industry whether it's Home
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
Depot and Lowe's uh Best Buy Any kind of
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
retailer they add locations they take
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
away locations it's the nature of
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
business based upon their market
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
performance which I totally understand
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
but my other concern is going to be the
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
patients sure because when we create
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy deserts and we have Pharmacy
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
deserts then we have bigger issues going
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
on with patient access and and the
 
01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
statutes and the rules in the insurance
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
department for Network adequacy address
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
that issue directly they those rules
 
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
were reopt again not that long ago pre-
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic but in my you know my recent
 
01:37:02.189 --> 01:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
memory and as far as the contracts with
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
The Independents go I would be
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
interested to know from The Independents
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
if they're represented by a psao or not
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
I think that's an important piece of
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
information maybe we should invite the
 
01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
PS psao in and find out how successful
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
they are in negotiating with the big
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
three I think you should invite the PSA
 
01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
in so thank you thank you as is there
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
somebody from the pharmacy Community
 
01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
wants to get up and talk about Mac
 
01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.070 align:start position:0%
wants to get up and talk about Mac
or

01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
anything concerns you folks have at this
 
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
mean yeah
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
it could you help us with the insurance
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
department two parts of it we had two
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
presentations one was the insurance
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
department talking about their
 
01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.910 align:start position:0%
department talking about their
oversight

01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory of pbms and I want to
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
understand from your point of view
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
what's your interpretation that what
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
does it mean and the other side is going
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
to be on the Mac
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
side why you can't find the drugs on the
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
market represent a spirit's point of
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
view at the point above the Mac or at
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
least at the Mac so you're at least at
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
hold okay we can my my name is Steve
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
cavadas um I'm an independent Pharmacy
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
owner uh on the Contracting side
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
what I I think the question is is how
 
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
much control do we have with that
 
01:38:32.669 --> 01:38:32.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely none uh the only control that
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
we have is opt in or opt out um when we
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
negotiating that that is
 
01:38:44.109 --> 01:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
non-existent um now we do use a
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
psao um and the thought process that
 
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
it's only 30 stores no it's a it's
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of stores so when we look at
 
01:38:57.589 --> 01:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
how do we compare you know the Mac price
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
of the the size of the entity well we're
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
as big as the chains so Nationwide which
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
is how these contracts work uh at least
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge so there's a little bit
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
of bickering that goes back and forth
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
between the psao and the PBM um but I
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't think that it is a a adequate
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship where both
 
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:23.910 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship where both
parties

01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
parties
 
01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
benefit we're always in a situation
 
01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
where this is what it is and if you
 
01:39:33.790 --> 01:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
don't want it leave it um if I
 
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
could so is the contract with yourself
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
in the psao OR with the directly with
 
01:39:45.149 --> 01:39:45.159 align:start position:0%
the PBM we have both we have a contract
 
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
with the PC psao that that does the
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
majority of the contracts and then we
 
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:53.719 align:start position:0%
have independent contracts with those
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
that do not play in the sandbox with the
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
psao do you know what they are at the
 
01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
top of your head human man is one that I
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
have and I I believe we have a separate
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
contract with KARK as
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
well if you could find out yep be
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
helpful is with the
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
PSO which pvms are covered by that and
 
01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
which ones you're doing independently
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
the ones you're doing independently
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
again it' be helpful understand are you
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
actually negotiating that independent
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
contract or you basically this is a take
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
to leave it it's usually it's facts to
 
01:40:31.229 --> 01:40:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
you I was an independent Pharmacy oh I'm
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
sorry my name is Glenn peral Colonial
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy New London um I have contracted
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
independently with um pbms and gone
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
through psao I've used psao affiliated
 
01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:47.589 align:start position:0%
through psao I've used psao affiliated
with

01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:51.639 align:start position:0%
wholesalers I've also used a psao who is
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
an independent psao align
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
RX um the
 
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
um the Contracting is is is the same no
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
matter which way the I've tried red
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
lining on my own uh I know the psos have
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
tried red lining uh and try to
 
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
renegotiate the contract and they're
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
they're is no movement on rate the only
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
movement that we see uh is on
 
01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.430 align:start position:0%
movement that we see uh is on
reporting

01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
um there's some effective rate language
 
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
that in there uh that may move a little
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
bit but basically the reimbursement rate
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
does not
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
move um and so the
 
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
um you talk about um patient steering L
 
01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:40.470 align:start position:0%
um you talk about um patient steering L
willing

01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
willing
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
provider uh the big problem with with
 
01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
with those types of Law and what we've
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
seen recently with the um DOD Tri care
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
contract was
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
if a PBM does not want you in
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
network then they offers a
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
ridiculous reimbursement rate and they
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
won't have you in in their Network and
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the big things that that
 
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh I know Congress is discussing right
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
now is is the latest DOD Tri care um
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
contract ises that contract through a
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
PBM or is that contract with federal
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
government it's through a PBM uh
 
01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.990 align:start position:0%
government it's through a PBM uh
prescripts

01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
prescripts
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
um is the PBM involved with the dod Tri
 
01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
care what reason would they give for not
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
wanting you in the
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
know I was under the impression that the
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
vendors okay without really thinking
 
01:42:51.629 --> 01:42:51.639 align:start position:0%
about the unintended consequence of that
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
decision so you know I think it was just
 
01:42:54.199 --> 01:42:55.470 align:start position:0%
decision so you know I think it was just
a

01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
downhill we need less vendors um but but
 
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't have anything to back that
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
up that was just
 
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
something indries I've read and and what
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
not didn't make sense to me uh if if you
 
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
paying the same rate to to everybody and
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's my interpretation of the any
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
willing you know provider then what
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
difference doesn't make how many vendors
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
you have if you're paying them the same
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's there's a a huge
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about the any willing
 
01:43:28.159 --> 01:43:30.870 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about the any willing
provider

01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:43:33.149 --> 01:43:33.159 align:start position:0%
because when we look at the chains
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
versus ourselves and versus mail order
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
if everybody's being reimbursed the same
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
amount then I don't think that mail
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
order would be
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
cheaper now you're adding the expense of
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
mail and all that Garb I I don't want to
 
01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
sound Flip or anything like that but
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
I've seen them do it with military
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
aircrafts so I know they do this doesn't
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
make any difference what the business is
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
they want as few contractors as possible
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
and it it doesn't make a whole lot of
 
01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
sense in many cases so I appreciate what
 
01:44:02.599 --> 01:44:03.669 align:start position:0%
sense in many cases so I appreciate what
you're

01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:44:06.589 --> 01:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
saying now to comment on the Mac
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
discussion about the time frame I I am
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
going to agree with the this gentleman
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
over here um
 
01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
that the prices do go up rapidly on
 
01:44:23.229 --> 01:44:23.239 align:start position:0%
certain drugs and right now the entire
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
add Market is on its ear as far as
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
pricing so sort of locking us into a
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
price that's two weeks old uh it would
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
be tough because in some cases like on
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
generic viance it has gone from $300
 
01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
bottle to $1,200 a bottle so you know we
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
would have to say for two weeks well
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
we're not going to serve you we're not
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to serve you you know the problem
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
is with the Mac is that you I was one of
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
the people that tried to get it to
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
understand where they're getting a
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
product from is that we are
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
contractually obligated to keep the
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
majority of our purchases with our
 
01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.830 align:start position:0%
majority of our purchases with our
primary

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
wholesaler so you know in order to get
 
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:09.080 align:start position:0%
best price and once again our buying
 
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
group is thousands of stores not just
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
one or two or 30 um you know we it it's
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
hard to find better
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
pricing um
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
so I'd leave the timing available you
 
01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
know so that these things can fluctuate
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that they they go down
 
01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
faster than they go up is issue number
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
one from from our perspective and and
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
and and that's just anecdotal you know
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
you see the the pricing you see the
 
01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
losses you go oh my gosh that was quick
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
that that you know they changed it to go
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
down but they don't change it to go up
 
01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
he's talking about the max right the max
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
max change down very very quickly but
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
they're very very slow to go up
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's just talking to Cole it sounded
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
like the um way the gasoline prices work
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
they go up real quick they come down
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
rolls low correct correct and that was
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
the whole the you know in in last uh
 
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
meeting that we were here yes there are
 
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
rules on we can uh uh audit the Mac
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
price and ask for the a review and
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
whatnot uh but that is an exercise that
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
is is just futile uh I've done hundreds
 
01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:23.470 align:start position:0%
is is just futile uh I've done hundreds
of

01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
of of requests myself outside of the
 
01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
psao and I would say maybe mid to Upper
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
90 percentile are denied so so what role
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
does the insurance department do to help
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
you that is that is one of our issues
 
01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
that we tried to bring up is that we
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
have no place to go to and once again
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
based on what I've he is that well it's
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
a Mac list and they're paying the Mac
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
list and and contractually they have a
 
01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
Mac list so all the laws are being
 
01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:53.629 align:start position:0%
Mac list so all the laws are being
followed

01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
followed
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
that there's some ethical issues here
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
and you know to be able to say in and
 
01:47:03.629 --> 01:47:03.639 align:start position:0%
the reasoning that they were not able to
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
tell us where to buy that product was
 
01:47:09.070 --> 01:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
because it would be an undue burden on
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
them now they're taking thousands of Mac
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
requests probably daily throughout the
 
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
Country Weekly at least and they're
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
denying these they have people that are
 
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the prices they're figuring
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
out what they should be they spend time
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
to have different Mac prices on all
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
these different list of all these
 
01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
different entities but they can't tell
 
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
me where it comes from
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
so it it always seems to everything
 
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
benefits them and at the end of the day
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
we're all stakeholders in this process
 
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
and how can we all be in the and in the
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
sandbox together to to provide care when
 
01:47:55.229 --> 01:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
there's just so much non-transparency
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
and no answers and that is the
 
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
frustration that we have at least I have
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
um so you know the whole Mac thing is a
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
joke um you know so basically there is a
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
contract price and if oh if we are if if
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy is benefiting off of that
 
01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
contract price we are going to move it
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
to a Mac list there's no Rhyme or Reason
 
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
in my mind I don't know and they can
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
tell me that what's the logic of making
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
it non Mac to
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
and so if I could ask a simple question
 
01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
of the pain points that are out there
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
which one seems to be the most
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
problematic is it the question of Mac is
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
it a question I mean at this point in
 
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
time you what you negotiate on your
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
dispensing fees to negotiate between you
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
and the PBM and that's a business
 
01:48:54.589 --> 01:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
decision but what I'm trying to get to
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
is the transparency about Mac so that
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
everyone's on the same page in some way
 
01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:49:03.390 --> 01:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
can rest assured that you're able to
 
01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:04.679 align:start position:0%
acquire it then the question will be
 
01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
where do you go if I heard it correctly
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
too if you do file an call it a
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
complaint or Challenge on the Mac
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
challenge is if you don't get a
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
response you don't have anywhere to go
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
right so that's where looking at the
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
insurance department insurance is going
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
to say what's in the contract well okay
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
yes so there's no arbitrator the
 
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
insurance department should be acting as
 
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
an arbitrator somehow begin to listen to
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
both sides I think it's a role that they
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
could play and it goes back to the
 
01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
operations we go back to before is that
 
01:49:40.270 --> 01:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
how do you it's not just you I'm looking
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
at the patient side of the equation too
 
01:49:43.709 --> 01:49:43.719 align:start position:0%
with prior approvals because when you go
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
through a prior approval process
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
providers and Physicians and patients
 
01:49:49.229 --> 01:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
you get caught into this process and
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
it's very complicated in some ways very
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
convoluted but I'm not sure what people
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
have where they can go and and then
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's silly unintended consequences of
 
01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
that so as an example you know you as an
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
example you get a a script in that
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
requires a prior authorization you give
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
them a three-day Supply happens to be a
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
controlled C2 uh script now it's dead so
 
01:50:15.629 --> 01:50:15.639 align:start position:0%
now the patient has a three-day Supply
 
01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
but we can't we can't rebuild the rest
 
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
to the insurance company then we have
 
01:50:24.990 --> 01:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
get the provider involved and and it's
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
just a a massive waste of time um and
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
and and the frustrating thing about the
 
01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
prior authorizations is that there are
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
some not many but there are some where
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
we it takes forever to get this approval
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
and then it comes back that the patient
 
01:50:40.119 --> 01:50:42.149 align:start position:0%
and then it comes back that the patient
pays

01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
pays
 
01:50:42.159 --> 01:50:44.149 align:start position:0%
pays
100%

01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
100%
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
co-pay and I lose so we have this huge
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
entity that is controlling absolutely
 
01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
Ely everything and it benefited nobody
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
now yes we can argue oh yes we got the
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
drug drug cheaper for the for the
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
client well yeah but this is why we have
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
deserts and this is why we're closing
 
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
and this is why we're not carrying the
 
01:51:11.069 --> 01:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
products anymore and this is why people
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
are finding it more and more difficult
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
to find their
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
stuff you know we have to
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
survive and we're just asking for people
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
to be fair and transparency is a huge
 
01:51:22.199 --> 01:51:23.589 align:start position:0%
to be fair and transparency is a huge
begin

01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
begin
 
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
huge part of this that everybody hides
 
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
ping you know curtains and we get
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
nowhere with it and as soon as it's too
 
01:51:35.709 --> 01:51:35.719 align:start position:0%
much work for the PBM then it it falls
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
out of committee so could you help me in
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
a very broad sense what percentage of
 
01:51:44.830 --> 01:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
the business and the prescription is not
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
the front end but the business of
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
filling prescription what percentage of
 
01:51:50.189 --> 01:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
your business today is going through a
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
pvm versus the old days most of it was
 
01:51:54.990 --> 01:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
cash so what's happening now because it
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
was probably 80 90% cash back in the 80s
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
is what percentage of your business now
 
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
going through pbms I would I would guess
 
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
and and this isn't I I could pull some
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
numbers for you but I would be surprised
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
if it was greater than
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
10% cash cash cash so B basically 90% of
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
it's going through a PBM process
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and it's probably higher
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
than that question
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
yes please uh you you spoke of uh in
 
01:52:28.350 --> 01:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
generalities of problems and of course
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
we can't attack generalities but can you
 
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
give us some examples and maybe you did
 
01:52:35.229 --> 01:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
in some of these emails that we just got
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
today of EX of the specific types of
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
incidences and problems that you're
 
01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
having that we could try to
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
address I mean just saying that the
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
insurance companies a black hole doesn't
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
help correct that so part of it is
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
consistent pricing so so
 
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
although as Peg was saying earlier
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid has their their reimbursement
 
01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
which is very generous compared to
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
everybody else but since most of
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid goes through the mcos well that
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't count and they were able to
 
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
carve out the pricing of that when they
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
when they develop those contracts so
 
01:53:16.109 --> 01:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
although Medicaid has a Mac list and
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid has a reimbursement structure
 
01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:20.679 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid thinks that our dispensing
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
fee should be whatever they have it as
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
nobody else follows that and and they
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to and the dispensing fees
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
that they give us are in the
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
pennies um so it it's almost worthless
 
01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:37.639 align:start position:0%
to have that as part of the contract you
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
know when we look at the National Data
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
it actually costs between what 1050 11
 
01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
something per script um and and and and
 
01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
we really are you know having to squeeze
 
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
that 10% of our customers to help make
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
up the tunnel losses and and once again
 
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not saying that the PBM
 
01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
should not make money you know and
 
01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
they're in their contracts they're
 
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to make
 
01:54:07.149 --> 01:54:07.159 align:start position:0%
20% and we discussed that last time and
 
01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
and we can talk about what all that
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
means but that is not allowed in my
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
business okay that for them for the PBM
 
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
sorry if I'm pointing in this direction
 
01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
but if if the PBM said to me I want to
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
make sure you make
 
01:54:27.629 --> 01:54:27.639 align:start position:0%
20% I would send them flowers for our
 
01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
benefit because some of us are older
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
than others of us could you write this
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
down and and provide it to us so we
 
01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:36.679 align:start position:0%
don't forget and we can address the
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
issue yeah we can we can distri problem
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
I've seen that but I have not heard so
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
far that that is that kind of an issue
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to get some more clarity on
 
01:54:50.109 --> 01:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
that yeah representative Merchant
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned um Mac Plus dispensing fee and
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
the dispensing fee is
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
contractual just so that the committee
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
is aware there are no dispensing fees
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
we're not talking dollars anymore we're
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
talking nickels and dimes as a as a
 
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
dispensing fee when we transmit a claim
 
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
off to uh get adjudicated our
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
transmission fees are higher than the
 
01:55:16.639 --> 01:55:17.990 align:start position:0%
transmission fees are higher than the
dispensing

01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
dispensing
 
01:55:20.350 --> 01:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
fees generally speaking and I gave you
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
some examples of those are actual ual
 
01:55:26.069 --> 01:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
patient profiles from my Pharmacy and
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
you can see the impact and the
 
01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that I'm getting for those
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%
prescriptions they do not cover the vial
 
01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
the cap and the label never mind any
 
01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
other label any other labor that went
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
into it that's what we're dealing with
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
and you have a patient that's getting
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
nine prescriptions that's a critical
 
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
patient and out of those nine
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
prescriptions you have one brand name
 
01:55:53.470 --> 01:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
medication and the brand name
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement we're losing 3040 $50 on
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
and and you're done you you're you're
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
done you you make eight or n9ine dollars
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
on the other eight prescriptions and you
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
lose 50 on the one brand name I think I
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
provided my August dispensings of brand
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
name medications and you can see how far
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
underwater I was on brand name
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
dispensing is that the document you gave
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
us just today correct okay that is
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
grossly under represented of what I used
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
to do because I am telling patients I
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
can't fill their prescriptions anymore
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
they're going off to other stores um if
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
they're getting them at all because I
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't know who in their right mind would
 
01:56:38.669 --> 01:56:38.679 align:start position:0%
would take on these these patients that
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
we're losing hundreds thousands of
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
dollars a year on that's one month
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's per month that yeah that's that's
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
one month that of that that print out
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
that I gave you um to answer another
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives questions
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
do the good RX single care cards require
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
a fee I provided a document of another
 
01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
trick that the pbms are doing now if
 
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
their pricing is higher than those
 
01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:08.669 align:start position:0%
their pricing is higher than those
discount

01:57:08.669 --> 01:57:08.679 align:start position:0%
discount
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
cards without any knowledge to the
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
patient before it was out without any
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
knowledge to the pharmacy but we have
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
ways of detecting it now fortunately
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
they would transfer it over to a a
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
discount card and the discount card
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
would take their fee and you can see the
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
examples that I've laid out um there are
 
01:57:32.350 --> 01:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
some substantial nearly
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
$1,400 claims that were transferred to a
 
01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:36.069 align:start position:0%
$1,400 claims that were transferred to a
discount

01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
discount
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
card patients pays the drug up pays the
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
price at the
 
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
register and that amount because it was
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
transferred to a discount card does not
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
apply to their out of-pocket deductible
 
01:57:55.229 --> 01:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
so if they go to another Pharmacy they
 
01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
may not realize that but I have a
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
conversation with them at the counter
 
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
happening yeah and that's and that's how
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
I know there's a anti- clawback bill
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's how they get around
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
it the the amount of minutia that you
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
unbelievable why do you care
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
if they're you if
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy is using uh or if somebody
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
finds a discount card that maybe they
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
got from a drug drug dealer I mean a
 
01:58:33.119 --> 01:58:34.069 align:start position:0%
got from a drug drug dealer I mean a
drug

01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
drug
 
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
supplier drug dealer why do you care if
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're using that because don't you get
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
you you still get the uh the price for
 
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
the you can see the clawback that's
 
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
happening you on the document that I
 
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
printed you okay I'll wait and read it
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay let's make a clarification there's
 
01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
a difference between a discount card
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
from a
 
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and a discount card like
 
01:59:00.669 --> 01:59:00.679 align:start position:0%
good RX now years ago when good RX came
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
out you know I had somebody come in I
 
01:59:05.310 --> 01:59:05.320 align:start position:0%
like sure we'll take it and I ran the
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
claim and my price was cheaper than the
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
good RX price so they gave them my price
 
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
and then they charged me
 
01:59:17.229 --> 01:59:17.239 align:start position:0%
$16 now I didn't make $16 on the scrip
 
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times the fees that are
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
going back through to the
 
01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
discount cards through the PBM
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
maneuver the the discount card makes
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
more than I do and I'm losing money you
 
01:59:34.109 --> 01:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
know so where's the logic in all this
 
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
where you you know this is just crazy
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
and and I would
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
be their solvency is not a problem um
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
it's just a money machine and
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have zero protection I
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
have tried looking at the insurance
 
01:59:54.669 --> 01:59:54.679 align:start position:0%
department to see where can I go with
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
this and if we're just looking at the
 
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
laws well they're following the laws but
 
02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:02.510 align:start position:0%
laws well they're following the laws but
they're

02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
also finding ways to to make that
 
02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:08.679 align:start position:0%
advantage to them so the pbms supply
 
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
these good RX
 
02:00:13.709 --> 02:00:13.719 align:start position:0%
cards I'm not sure if they Supply them I
 
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
would venture they're involved somehow
 
02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
but we're not saying what that is yet I
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
mean we don't know what that is yet it
 
02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
happens in the back ground so I transmit
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
off a claim I think it's I think it's
 
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
going off to CVS KARK I think it's going
 
02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
off to KARK they have a KARK card uh it
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
comes back to me
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
adjudicated and the way I see it is and
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
you'll see my print screens that I
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
provided they'll say patient pays in my
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
example I think it was n
 
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
$658 but we don't know who that the
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
third party is that's the discount
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
so on that one screen you don't see it
 
02:01:01.629 --> 02:01:01.639 align:start position:0%
but I also printed out the EDI data
 
02:01:04.229 --> 02:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
received and you will see that it shows
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
the bin number and then it says GDX next
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
to the bin number which means they
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
transferred it off to the good RX card
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
yeah well Staker that that's alls to me
 
02:01:20.430 --> 02:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
allow us to a little research thank you
 
02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:23.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Curtis um it's 3:30 I want to try to
 
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
be sensitive to people's time I want to
 
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
say thank you for being here it would
 
02:01:30.510 --> 02:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
ask you if you have a
 
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
contact with a psao or SL wholesaler
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
that we can possibly contact I'm trying
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
to find out if we can actually have
 
02:01:43.069 --> 02:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
somebody give a presentation remotely so
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be here physically um
 
02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
but I'm still working my way through
 
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
that process
 
02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
but if You' email it to me and so forth
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
if I can reach out to them I think
 
02:01:55.069 --> 02:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
that's important I have some homework
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
coming from the insurance department
 
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
from attorney Heaton um as far as that
 
02:02:01.629 --> 02:02:01.639 align:start position:0%
goes I think Mr Barry you've got a
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
couple of to-dos I think CVS um Express
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
SCP sorry has a couple of to-dos
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
um did I miss anybody I've got them down
 
02:02:13.229 --> 02:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
here somewhere I'm sure you probably
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
have all you too but I want to say at
 
02:02:16.030 --> 02:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
this point in time the next meeting will
 
02:02:20.189 --> 02:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
be on October 3rd at 1:30 location I'm
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
not sure I think Miss Davis is working
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
on that the meeting after that will be
 
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
October 17th again at 1:30 and if
 
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
necessary wrap this up will be October
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
26 we need to get some sort of report
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
out recommendation if you will from this
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
committee about future legislation and
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
maybe at that point in time one of those
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
meetings with my colleagues on this
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
committee is talk about drafting some
 
02:02:48.069 --> 02:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
potential legislation at least focus on
 
02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
a couple of topics I think Max is
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
probably a big one and the other one's
 
02:02:52.830 --> 02:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
going to going be the role of the
 
02:02:54.669 --> 02:02:54.679 align:start position:0%
insurance department within the PBM
 
02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
World itself I think what I heard was
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
what are we doing operationally as far
 
02:03:00.910 --> 02:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
as plan design and things of that nature
 
02:03:04.189 --> 02:03:04.199 align:start position:0%
it's Aisa um that's really up to the
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
plan it's up to the employer it's up to
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
people buying it I don't think this
 
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
committee should be involved with the
 
02:03:12.030 --> 02:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
plan design but when you're dealing with
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts of the operation and
 
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
communication and accountability and Mac
 
02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
challenges and all those things I think
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's something that's right for a
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
discussion so I want toour the meeting
