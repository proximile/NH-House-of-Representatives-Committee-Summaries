00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
hearing with the Pledge of Allegiance
 
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
and so uh there was a flag right behind
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
me so if you wouldn't mind standing
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll start this
 
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh so first up today is
 
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
HB 206 including space force and various
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
definitions of the Armed Forces there is
 
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 align:start position:0%
one sponsor that's representative Roy I
 
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
do not see representative Roy yet or
 
00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
here he's the sole sponsor so what I'm
 
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
going to do is I'm going to introduce
 
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
the bill so that we can we have several
 
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
people who signed up to speak to it
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
so HP 206 including space force and
 
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
various definitions of the Armed Forces
 
00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
so in our statute
 
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
relevant statute that's RSA 4 colon 13
 
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.710 align:start position:0%
relevant statute that's RSA 4 colon 13
Dash

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
Dash
 
00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
I uh it simply entails adding you know
 
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
say space force to the five existing
 
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 align:start position:0%
branches that are listed in our statute
 
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
those being in order uh U.S Air Force
 
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
U.S army United States Coast Guard
 
00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
United States Navy and essays Marine
 
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.009 align:start position:0%
United States Navy and essays Marine
Corps

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 align:start position:0%
Corps
 
00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.390 align:start position:0%
Corps
and

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
there are two other spots it simply adds
 
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
space force and statute along with those
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
other five branches in our existing
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
statute and that is the essence of
 
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
HB 206
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
again not seeing representative Roy here
 
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
um I do have a request from Melissa
 
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 align:start position:0%

button and and welcome to state federal
 
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
and veterans
 
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Roy for the
 
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
introduction to the bill and Mr Perry

for being here today chairman Moffett
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman Rollins and distinguished
 
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
members of the state federal relations
 
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
and Veterans Affairs committee I am
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
Melissa Willette New England Regional
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
liaison for the United States Department
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
of Defense State liaison office and I'm
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
here today to testify in favor of the
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
policies reflected in House Bill 206
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
adding space force to the various
 
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
definitions of armed forces in the New
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire revised statutes
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
by clearly defining Armed Forces to
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
include the space force the state of New
 
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can minimize disruptions and
 
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
benefits and services for eligible
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
service members and their dependents
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
this is because when state laws align
 
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
with federal laws it ensures that
 
00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 align:start position:0%
service members and their families have
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
access to the same benefits and service
 
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
Services no matter where they are
 
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.050 align:start position:0%
Services no matter where they are
stationed

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
stationed
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
updating the definition of military
 
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
service in the state of New Hampshire to
 
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
include the space force will also ensure
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
that service members and their families
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
have a smooth transition when they move
 
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
to the state this is particularly
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
important for active duty service
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
members and their families who are
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
required to move frequently
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
on December 20th 2019 Congress enacted
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
the United States space force act which
 
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
established the United States space
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
force as an armed Force within the
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
department of the Air Force its primary
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
mission is to organize train and equip
 
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
military personnel for space operations
 
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
and defend the United States interest in
 
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.650 align:start position:0%
and defend the United States interest in
space

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
as a result of this change as you were
 
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
likely aware New Hampshire became home
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
to New Boston space force station in
 
00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County which spreads across
 
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
the towns of New Boston Amherst and
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
Mount Vernon New Boston space force
 
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
station is operated by the 23rd space
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
operations Squadron which maintains the
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
largest satellite control Network remote
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
tracking station in the world along with
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
command and control capability for the
 
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
global positioning system
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 206 is not only key to the
 
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
Readiness and retention of the service
 
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
members serving at New Boston space
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
force station but to those current and
 
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
former space force Guardians stationed
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
elsewhere who call the granite state
 
00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:25.610 align:start position:0%
elsewhere who call the granite state
home

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
space force is the First new branch of
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
the Armed Forces in over seven decades
 
00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
this requires states to consider
 
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
modifying their policies to ensure their
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
definition reflects this change in force
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
structure which will minimize
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
disruptions and benefits and services
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
for space force Guardians as well as
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
their families
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
adding this branch of service to the New
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire revised statute's definition
 
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
of armed forces will ensure that
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
military families are equally
 
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
represented under all New Hampshire laws
 
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:56.180 align:start position:0%
which Define military service military
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
retiree and Veteran and that all
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
Guardians receive the benefits and
 
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
resourcing they have earned through
 
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
their service
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
for example this legislation also
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
clarifies that military family care
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
providers certified by the Department of
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
Defense or the military services
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
including the space force May provide
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
child care to the children of military
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
families off the installation which may
 
00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
Benefit Service members housed in the
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth region who are assigned to
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
Naval Shipyard Portsmouth to put it
 
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
simply by updating the definition of
 
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
armed forces to include the space force
 
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire will be able
 
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
to ensure that service members and their
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
families have access to the same
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
benefits and services as they would at
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
any other Duty station and that they are
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
not unfairly impacted by state laws that
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
do not reflect Federal changes
 
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
failure to act could make it more
 
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
difficult to attract highly skilled
 
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
individuals to the branch this would
 
00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.019 align:start position:0%
limit the talent pool available to the
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
space force and could make it more
 
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
difficult to fill critical vacancies not
 
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
including the space force and the
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
definition of armed services in the
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire could also
 
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
negatively impact Readiness and
 
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.070 align:start position:0%
negatively impact Readiness and
resiliency

Grady I'm a 25-year Air Force veteran
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm also a 23-year resident of the
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
town of Hooksett New Hampshire uh the
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
the state veterans advisory committee
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm representing today they we
 
00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
fully support this bill we actually did
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
have the language on it and we voted on
 
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
it at our January 3rd meeting and we
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
were unanimously in support of this and
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
my position on the state veterans
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
advisory committee the group I represent
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
is the Air Force Association which has
 
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
recently changed their name to the air
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
and space forces Association so I'm
 
00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:17.459 align:start position:0%
acutely aware of of the space force and
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
and what those folks do and I'm also
 
00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:21.959 align:start position:0%
aware that to a lot of Americans the
 
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
space force is a Steve Carell TV series
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
on Netflix and you know we need to sort
 
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
of let people know that they just
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
celebrated their third anniversary on
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
December 20th as a separate service
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
under the department of the Air Force
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
very much like the Marines are a
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
separate service under the department of
 
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:39.860 align:start position:0%
the Navy it's the same kind of
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
relationship so we do support this
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislation you know we do have as a
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
previous speaker mentioned a new New
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
Boston space force station in the summer
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
of 2021 was was moved from being an Air
 
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
Force Station to a space force station
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
they actually have four Guardians
 
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
assigned out there there's also about
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
120 uh civilian contractors and DOD
 
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
civilians that that work out at that
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
place and what they do basically is they
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh they they drive satellites
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
at that place they control satellites in
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
space you know every every without
 
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
turning this into a less a lesson in uh
 
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
in orbital mechanics you know everything
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
in space is falling and periodically you
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
have to fire some rockets for a for the
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
space station or anything in space to
 
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
remain in space you got to fire some
 
00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
rockets and put it back where it belongs
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of what those folks out
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
there do
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
um I was really fortunate in in the fall
 
00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
of 2021 to take a tour of New Boston
 
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
space force station and I highly
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
recommend that you take the VIP tour out
 
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
there sometime you actually go out in
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
the woods and see parts of the
 
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
reservation that used to be an old
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
bombing range and those kind of things
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
I'll split the chairman I'll send the
 
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Lieutenant Colonel Dave
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
zezinger who's the commander out there
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
I'll send you his contact information
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
and in the spring when the snow melts
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
you really should go out there and see
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
that operation it's very it takes a
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
couple of hours of your time it's a very
 
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
impressive thing
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
um so we do unanimously support this
 
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
bill uh and you know anything we can do
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
to help the space force uh be be a
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
little bit more known to Americans as a
 
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
group that's out there you know part of
 
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:14.820 align:start position:0%

00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:16.019 align:start position:0%

afar and we'll watch this later who may
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
have some questions about
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
um space force I know it's three years
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh some folks may be wondering what who
 
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
did the functions of that are currently
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
being done by space force who did those
 
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
before and could what was the thinking
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
behind creating this new Branch if you
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
could speak to that well the the
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
uh these were done kind of jointly by
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
all of the services the Army has a
 
00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
fairly robust program in Alabama at
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
redstone Stone Arsenal is where they
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
they have a group of folks that do a lot
 
00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
of the same things the Air Force had the
 
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
majority of the space assets out in
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
Colorado Springs and controlled a lot of
 
00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
the the satellite tracking stations
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
around the world the commander here also
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
owns Greenland goes up to Greenland
 
00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339 align:start position:0%
periodically and and takes a look at at
 
00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
Satellite so those functions were all
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
done by a kind of a smattering of each
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
service had a small part of the pie the
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
Air Force had the largest part of the
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
pie which is why they put this under the
 
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
Air Force when they created a separate
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
service but I I think much as
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
I was back in the post-world War II era
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
in 1947 when they created the Air Force
 
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
as a special as a separate branch of the
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
military and we came out from under the
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
department of the army I think that the
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
thinking was in in Washington that what
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
we needed was an advocate for space you
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
know as long as space didn't have its
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
own you know uh co-equal Branch status
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
with everybody else that they were sort
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
of going to get what's left over after
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
everything was uh was kind of divvied up
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
and so I think that they wanted somebody
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
out there that's going to take the lead
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
for space and space programs so we don't
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
forget about it and as a personal aside
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
I used to teach space and space force
 
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
things to my junior ROTC students in at
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
Auburn High School and I told them if if
 
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
we can't get your generation as excited
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
about space travel as I was watching
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
people walk on the moon back in the
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
1960s then we're never going to do it
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
we're never going to invest the money
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
that it's going to take to do it so
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
we've got to we've got to keep that in
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
the press and we've got a and even the
 
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
private space stuff that's going out
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
there you know sending William Shatner
 
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
to space keeps people
 
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
you know engaged in in in space
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
operations and so I think that they
 
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
wanted somebody to take the lead on that
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
and that's what we ended up with the
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
space force
 
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for that great answer
 
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
uh other questions or anything for
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
Colonel Grady
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
Crow Grady would you like to go to space
 
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
as uh William Shatner I was convinced I
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
was going to go to space when I was
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
younger uh and uh as I used to tell my
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
students I'm still looking for that
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
rocket pack we're all supposed to have
 
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
that I can drive around on okay so yes I
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
would I would love to do it someday I
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
think but maybe maybe my age though it's
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
the space world has passed me by
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
Senator Glenn was I think older than you
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
and I'll bet you were tracking that when
 
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
he went to space I was tracking it
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes sir and most of us have
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
seen the right stuff more than once um
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I won't ask if you
 
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
have the right stuff but I will thank
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
you for for your testimony and for being
 
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else uh wishing to speak to
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh HB 206 including space force and
 
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
if not at this time
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
that's my historic first gavel strike
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
will close this hearing and before it
 
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:26.220 align:start position:0%

here today but I see representative
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
Lundgren is in the house
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
and representative Lundgren
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to invite you to do what the
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
other folks did last week and take a

okay we still have almost 10 minutes and
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
we have to uh we have to we cannot start

first met I have a something that is
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
more in keeping with uh
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
what I believed in and you know I told
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
you I was raised in a rough neighborhood
 
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff but excuse me

welcome to speak up you have you have
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
the floor and a
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
audience on YouTube that could be around
 
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
the world I thank you kindly and you
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
know last time I spoke about many many
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
many things a rough neighborhood in the
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
whole bit but I do have some
 
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
accomplishments I was never in combat I
 
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
joined the Navy in 1981 naval Reserve
 
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
here in Manchester
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
in 1961 and uh
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
when I came out of boot camp that summer
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
I was one of the honor guards for Alan
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
Shepard when he came to used to be
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
grineer Air Force Base at the time and
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
so I was 17 years old scared to death I
 
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
saw him for about a half a second and my
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
second claim to fame is I served on the
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
ship that picked up John Glenn in 62. I
 
00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:45.299 align:start position:0%
was still in high school at the time but
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
I served I remember seeing the little
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
feet stenciled in painted in on this
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
deck on the deck in a little in a little
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%

watch the movie hidden figures talks
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
about the Apollo program where John

Glenn ended up going up there and those
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
three black women who were instrumental

in
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
making that Apollo program a success
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
towards the end of the movie for about a
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
second and a half you'll see John Glenn
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
being picked up by the USS Noah and
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's the ship I was on
 
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:27.299 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
two minutes ten seconds you went over
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative gagne
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%

Shepard who you mentioned the first
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
American in space in 1961 a New
 
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a proud New Hampshire uh
 
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
Native went to uh Pinkerton Academy in
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
Derry Pickerton is known as the Astros
 
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
and I have asked this nobody's been able
 
00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:54.539 align:start position:0%
to answer it but yet maybe reps of
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
London that's your area what was
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton called before they were the
 
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
Astros I I don't know but I'm sure back
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the 30s and 40s they weren't the
 
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.330 align:start position:0%
in the 30s and 40s they weren't the
Astros

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
Astros
 
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:10.250 align:start position:0%
Astros
okay

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
I think it was just Pinkerton Academy
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
and did not have a nickname they must
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
if I have somebody watching on on

00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
we still have a couple minutes before we
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
will start right on time at 10 hundred
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
hours the uh measure of the coming up
 
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.299 align:start position:0%
before us uh representative petusic will
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
be introducing it we had a little
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
conversation ahead of time
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
um relating to
 
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
the notion of uh guard reservists being
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
activated some of us have been in that
 
00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:09.110 align:start position:0%
activated some of us have been in that
position

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
I think it was 1968 there was a guard
 
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
unit out of New Hampshire that was in
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
Vietnam and uh just before that unit was
 
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:21.539 align:start position:0%
about to return from Vietnam the uh a
 
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
tragic uh I think they hit a tried to
 
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:27.299 align:start position:0%
hit a land mine we had
 
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
um uh as a number of grandstaters who
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
are just about to return Guardsmen I
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
believe were just about to return to New
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who tragically lost their
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
lives in Vietnam just before these
 
00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:42.539 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen are about to return to New
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and of course there was no
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
official declaration of war at that time
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%

00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
testimony on this area
 
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to round this up to 1000
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
hours and uh representative patosek if
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
we'd like to invite you up to uh
 
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860 align:start position:0%

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%

petusic from Rockingham 13 in Derry
 
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.289 align:start position:0%
petusic from Rockingham 13 in Derry
uh

00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
to your committee
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
relative to requiring an official
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
declaration of war for the activation of
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
I myself am a Vietnam veteran
 
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:48.620 align:start position:0%
which precedes
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
the National Guard being called up for
 
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.289 align:start position:0%
the National Guard being called up for
uh

00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:54.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:54.299 --> 00:29:55.850 align:start position:0%
uh
whatever

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
and I don't like the whatever
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
there should be a reason why they're
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
called up and there should be
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
justification with the Congress
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
and Vietnam was a war whether they had a
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
declaration of war or not it was a war
 
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
I have enough friends who are on the
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
wall in Washington
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
they died for a Cause
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
now I was asked to bring this to the
 
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
house I was told that last biennium
 
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
it did not make it through
 
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:33.620 align:start position:0%
I was asked
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
I asked for co-sponsors
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
and if memory serves every one of my
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors on here
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
is a veteran
 
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
we have Army
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
we have Marine Corps
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
myself as Air Force
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we have any costies
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
but anyway it's all veterans and I
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
believe that no military body
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
Air Guard Army guard
 
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
should be called out unless there is a
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
very very substantial reason for them
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
being called up the declaration of war
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
is one of them I've heard the fact that
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
it well you have problems with title 10
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
or title 32
 
00:31:22.679 --> 00:31:23.330 align:start position:0%
or title 32
um

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
that doesn't wash
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
so my job today is to present it and
 
00:31:32.529 --> 00:31:32.539 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit about it
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
I didn't know a lot about the guard
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
problem until I got involved in this and
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
the folks from bring our troops home
 
00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
sent me this very extremely informative
 
00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:47.269 align:start position:0%
sent me this very extremely informative
booklet

00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
booklet
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
born defending the guard and it's now
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
called the defend the guard bill
 
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
so I will take any questions that you
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
might have and try to answer them
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
I know for a fact that sitting in front
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
of me are at least three veterans that I
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
am very aware of and I'm very good
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
friends with
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
and it's probably more
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
because a lot of us don't show
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're veterans because in
 
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.610 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're veterans because in
some

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:18.620 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not a good thing but I'm
 
00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:24.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
a ribbon
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm proud of it
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions from anybody
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I have one
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
quick question and I know we have a
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
number of pink cards here
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh and I know Warren is he's still here
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
during a certain
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
activations or military operations there
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
is a refueling Wing or not Wing but
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
refilling unit that has flown out of
 
00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:03.140 align:start position:0%
peas in New Hampshire that has been
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
nationalized so to speak to support
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
Air Force operations so if this measure
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
were to move forward would this preclude
 
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:12.140 align:start position:0%
this unit from being
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
used for for such uh for such activity I
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
uh just from uh my perspective
 
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
I because I can't speak for anybody
 
00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.409 align:start position:0%
I because I can't speak for anybody
officially

00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:24.419 align:start position:0%
officially
 
00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:25.850 align:start position:0%
officially
um

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think this would interfere with
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
airguard uh
 
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.630 align:start position:0%
airguard uh
because

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:33:36.049 --> 00:33:36.059 align:start position:0%
back in the day when I was in Germany
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
and the outfit I was in was air mobile
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
and we depended upon uh two two of these
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
air squadrons one out of Dover Air Force
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
Base the other out of McGuire Air Force
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
Base 436 and the 438s air groups to
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
provide transportation to us wherever we
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
needed to go uh under orders that came
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
out of Washington
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
and they would come over pick us up drop
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
us off
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
a week later two weeks later a month
 
00:34:05.159 --> 00:34:06.169 align:start position:0%
a week later two weeks later a month
later

00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
they come back pick us up and take us
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
back to Germany uh where I was and what
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
I did uh I cannot share
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:23.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative
 
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
questions uh yet yes representative
 
00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.730 align:start position:0%
questions uh yet yes representative
massamilo

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
massamilo
 
00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
um under
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
part it talks about the performance of a
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
Duty through instrumentality of War what
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
Ah that's military legalese
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to Define uh for a
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
civilian Maybe
 
00:34:55.849 --> 00:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
the the Air Force Major Colonel might be
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
able to Define that for you but that's
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
as I used to say that's above my pay
 
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.990 align:start position:0%
as I used to say that's above my pay
grade

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
grade
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
way above mine
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:11.900 align:start position:0%
other questions for the prime sponsor
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative Finney
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
and I thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
um I also was in the Army Garden for
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
about 10 years I was part of a
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
Detachment whose parent company was out
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal no part of this says that
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
we lose about 400 million dollars in an
 
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
annual federal funding would we envision
 
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
um units being sent out of the state in
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
in order to uh
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
like not like you know cut costs but at
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
least to save money on you on the state
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
side because we wouldn't be getting
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
Federal funding anymore well I I looked
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
at this and I'm going in
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
my opinion is that if the federal
 
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
government calls you up the federal
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
government should be paying for it not
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
I mean we we have the guard and we have
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
the drills we have the programs that we
 
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
do in State uh and the emergencies that
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
we do in state but if the feds call you
 
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
up the FED should be paying the bill
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%

all right
 
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh chairman and
 
00:36:59.329 --> 00:36:59.339 align:start position:0%
members of the state and Veterans
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
Affairs committee I'm representative San
 
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
anastaso representing Rindge Jaffrey in
 
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
Dublin and also I served in the 82nd
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
Airborne Division as a combat medic and
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
it was awarded a combat medic badge for
 
00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:14.540 align:start position:0%
providing Medical Care Under Fire
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
this bill requires an official
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
declaration of war uh for the activation
 
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire National Guard and to
 
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
put the National Guard uh in compliance
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
with the Constitution of the United
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
States article one section 8 of the
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution vests in
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
Congress the uh exclusive power to
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
declare war
 
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
so there's two ways National Guardsmen
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
can be called into uh service under U.S
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
code it's title 10 or title 32.
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
um so when mobilized under title 10 uh
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen are directed by the president
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
to report for active duty in an official
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
capacity where they are under the
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
command of the president United States
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
and the federal government will provide
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
budgetary funding title 10 allows the
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
president to federalize National Guard
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
units for the lawful purposes of
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
National Defense overseas trainings and
 
00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:05.579 align:start position:0%
of enforcement of federal Authority
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
when mobilized under title 32 uh
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen remain under the command of
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
the governor who's the
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
commander-in-chief of his or her
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
respective State National Guard service
 
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
under title 32 was primarily State
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
active duty or was common referred to as
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
state call-up these missions commonly
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
are in response to Nash natural or
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
man-made disasters and Homeland defense
 
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
where the individual states will provide
 
00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:33.140 align:start position:0%
the budgetary funding
 
00:38:35.569 --> 00:38:35.579 align:start position:0%
so this bill continues compliance with
 
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
both of these codes uh where title 32
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
has to deal with disasters and Governor
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
command of the guard and title 10
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
authorizes the National Guard uh into
 
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
Federal service
 
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
um so the problem this bill solves is
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
that Congress hasn't formally declared
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
war since 1942
 
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
today the government uses the
 
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
authorization for use of military force
 
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh aumf of 2001 uh it's intended to deal
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
with those who committed the 9 11
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
attacks uh but as with many of these
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
government overreach measures only one
 
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative actually voted against
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
the thing it was Barbara Lee who stated
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's a blank check to the president to
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
attack anyone involved in December 11th
 
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
attacks anywhere in any country without
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
regard to our nation's long-term foreign
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
policy economic and National Security
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
interests without time limit and
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
granting these overly broad Powers the
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
Congress failed its responsibility to
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
understand the dimensions of its
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
declaration I could not support such a
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
grant of War making authority to the
 
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
president I believe it would put more
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
innocent lives at risk the president has
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional authority to protect
 
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
the nation from further attack and has
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
mobilized the Armed Forces to do just
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
that the Congress should have waited for
 
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
the facts to be presented and then acted
 
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
with Fuller knowledge of the
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
consequences of our action so that was
 
00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh Barbara Lee on the amuf uh in her
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
ignored statements predicted the
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
situation we are now where the aumf has
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
been allowed to allow U.S to conduct
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
operations in Afghanistan Philippines
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
Georgia Yemen uh to Buji Kenya Ethiopia
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
Iraq Somalia and others so uh we're
 
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
arguing that the aumf is not legal
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
according to section one I mean article
 
00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
one section 8 of The Constitution it's
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
well understood that Congress has the
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
power to declare war not the executive
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
branch and also that Congress cannot
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
simply delegate its authority to declare
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
war to the executive branch
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it's uh to to assert that the aumf
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
is legal according allowing the federal
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
government to conduct War over 20 20
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
years later where those members of
 
00:40:44.089 --> 00:40:44.099 align:start position:0%
Congress aren't even in office anymore
 
00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:44.750 align:start position:0%
Congress aren't even in office anymore
um

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know and it's just like this blanket
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
declaration uh it's not really in what
 
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
what the Constitution was intended to do
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
uh the thing is you know war is the it's
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
the greatest thing the state does I mean
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
they dropped uh two atomic bombs you
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
know on civilian populations in the 40s
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
and that that kind of power can't just
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
be left up to just blanket declarations
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh so the fiscal note suggests that
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
which was already brought up that we're
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
going to lose Federal funding because of
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
this thing now the thing about losing
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
Federal funding is or being able to have
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
these uh agreements with bases and
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
whatever uh is is for it doesn't matter
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
if the thing's illegal right if if we
 
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
have an illegal National Guard the the
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
funding like the actual bill if you read
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
the text it says
 
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
you know on the fiscal note it says
 
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of you know
 
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
this would make us follow the
 
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
Constitution and then we'll lose the
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
funding it's like okay well so do we
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
have an illegal Army then is that is
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal note almost suggests
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
that the National Guard is legally
 
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
funded because we're not in compliance
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
with the United States Constitution
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
um but even with that uh so
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
title 32 with uh there's a section 108
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
Which authorized the forfeiture of funds
 
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
when a state fails to comply with the
 
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
requirements of title 32
 
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
um so the the bill doesn't affect our
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
compliance even with title 10 uh but
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
under title 32 it's not even under
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
question because title 32 is under
 
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
command of the governor it's intended
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
for disasters and Homeland defense so I
 
00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:23.099 align:start position:0%
don't know where they're coming up with
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
this number because there's no reason
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
for us to lose Federal funding there's
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
no in compliance with any of these codes
 
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.069 align:start position:0%
no in compliance with any of these codes
um

00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
and then additionally section 108
 
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:35.339 align:start position:0%
doesn't result in immediate immediate or
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
immediate forfeiture of funds instead
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
the president must first give the state
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
a time frame which to remedy the failure
 
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
to comply and even if a state did not
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
yield the president has discretion to
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
determine how much funding may or may
 
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
not be withdrawn
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
and then also it's not even politically
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
feasible for the federal government to
 
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
pull funding from National Guard troops
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
so if they were authorized to do it they
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I mean the National Guard is
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
extremely popular with the public people
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
are very concerned about you know
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
funding for the National Guard and if
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
the federal government just started
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to pull funding I
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
mean it No No One's Gonna No One's Gonna
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
fight that battle I mean it's just
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
completely politically unfeasible to
 
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
just pull funding from the from the
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
National Guard
 
00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:19.069 align:start position:0%
National Guard
um

00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
all right and then just continue with my
 
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
testimony so the legislation is popular
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
with the new New Hampshire citizens uh I
 
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
talked to many members of my own
 
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
Community Republicans and Democrats it's
 
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
Universal I mean uh Americans in their
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
heart know from Civics their Civics
 
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
training that you know lawmaking is is
 
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
part of Congress and that Congress
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
declares the wars uh so when I when you
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
bring up this kind of thing to them they
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
say of course we should retain our
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
National Guard troops out of combat
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
unless there's a ejaculation of War I
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's like a no-brainer for uh
 
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.870 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's like a no-brainer for uh
grandstaters

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
grandstaters
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
so uh I haven't talked to any regular
 
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
person that thinks that this is a bad
 
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
measure uh oh and in addition to that
 
00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
there's lots of public organizations
 
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
that uh defend that support defend the
 
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
guard the ACLU of West Virginia supports
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
the defend the guard act as uh you know
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
they had the bill a bill similar Bill
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
brought to the West Virginia Congress
 
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
and they said um
 
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
so uh supports the defender guard is an
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
appropriate assertion of congress's sole
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
authority to wage war the conclusion of
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
the aclu's letter to the West Virginia
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
House Judiciary Committee States
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
the defender guard act seeks to use the
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
limited power of the state over the
 
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
National Guard to pressure the
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
Congressional executive branches of the
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
federal government to reverse the trend
 
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
of multiple long-term military
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
operations which any layperson would
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
understand to be War without a
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
congressional declaration of war as
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
required by Article 1 Section 8. it is
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
clear from multiple sources of law that
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
the power to declare war lies with
 
00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.390 align:start position:0%
the power to declare war lies with
Congress

00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
Congress has attempted to legislate much
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
of that Authority uh away both in Broad
 
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
feral code and through specific
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
authorizations uh the use of military
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
force it is not clear whether it is not
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
clear whether Congress can duly give
 
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
away Congressional Authority in such a
 
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.809 align:start position:0%
away Congressional Authority in such a
manner

00:45:16.809 --> 00:45:16.819 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
so all we're asking for is that before
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
the country decides to send uh New
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard troops into
 
00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:26.579 align:start position:0%
combat to kill and be killed that first
 
00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:29.220 align:start position:0%
the Congress does their Duty uh and
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
signs a declaration of war as they are
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required to
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
um so obviously I urge the committee to
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
make a OTP motion uh
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the house and that's
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Senator say
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
your name again for the record
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your service
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony your
 
00:45:59.569 --> 00:45:59.579 align:start position:0%
thorough testimony we have about 10
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
cards or so so there's a lot of interest
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
in this so uh as you testify uh you know
 
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
please say what you would like to say if
 
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
if some points have already been uh made
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
that are part of your testimony then
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
that you don't need to reiterate what
 
00:46:16.609 --> 00:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
has been said unless you feel a need to
 
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
all right next up uh represent Manning
 
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
do you uh
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
do you have any written uh testimony
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
you'd like to submit uh this is just my
 
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
scratch paper it's a mess okay so you
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
question was about written testimony in
 
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:33.829 align:start position:0%
question was about written testimony in
um

00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
I will point out that our sessions are
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
on YouTube and which makes it a little
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
bit easier for our clerk knowing that uh
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
there's a a record out there and uh
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
before I go to represent Manny and I uh
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
previous speaker mentioned we haven't
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
declared war since 1942 which is true
 
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
the last time we declared war was in in
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
January of 1942 in the country we
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
declared war on was Bulgaria in case you
 
00:46:59.930 --> 00:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
didn't know that all right Russian
 
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
Armenian um welcome thank you thank you
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee my
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
name is Tom minion I'm a representing
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District uh Juan Pelham I'm a
 
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps infantry veteran that
 
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
enlisted in 2004 to hunt down those
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for 9 11. however I didn't
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
get a chance to do that like all service
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
members I went where I was told even
 
00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
though I didn't completely understand
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
why you're going to hear counter
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
arguments today but take it from an
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
enlisted grunt that's been knocked onto
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
my ass into Iraqi dirt by a VB IED
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that convinced me to
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
continue sending our Guardsmen into
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way without going through the
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
correct process
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
my first deployment to Iraq start in
 
00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
August 2005. one of the guys in my
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
platoon was from New Orleans and he
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
learned about Hurricane Katrina over a
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
satellite phone call back home
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
he was raised by his grandmother and he
 
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
was alone and she was alone during that
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
catastrophe we gave him our allotted sat
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
phone time to make calls to neighbors to
 
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
make sure she got out safely it wasn't
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
until years later that I found out that
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
the Louisiana National Guard was
 
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
deployed to Iraq right around the same
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
time we were the Department of Defense
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
sent active duty Marine Corps infantry
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
battalions to help with Katrina using
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
War fighters to fulfill the mission
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
objectives of search and rescue
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen the motto of the National
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
Guard is always ready always there but
 
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
the operation supporting
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Wars prevents them from
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
fulfilling this Florida National
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen were training Ukrainian
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
soldiers instead of helping the
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
hurricane disaster relief fires in
 
00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:23.099 align:start position:0%
Oregon were left to spread because their
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
guard were in Afghanistan
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Guardsmen were in Syria
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
protecting the interests of oil
 
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
companies instead of aiding their
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
neighbors back home when tornadoes
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
devastated communities
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
this committee was briefed by the
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
adjutant general last week where he said
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
over 300 of our New Hampshire Guardsmen
 
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
were deployed to the Middle East right
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
now imagine if we got smashed by a
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
nor'easter and needed those 300 here to
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
assist our families and Neighbors
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
they would not be there they were
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
instead off supporting an
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional undeclared war
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
another terrible consequence of these
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
unending Wars is the mental and
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
emotional toll on our service members
 
00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
again as this committee was brief last
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
week New Hampshire is one of the states
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
with the highest suicide rate among
 
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.530 align:start position:0%
with the highest suicide rate among
veterans

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
this is a serious problem that we in
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
this legislature can combat by passing
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
HB 229 Force Congress to do their
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional duty to risk the ire of
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
their constituents by voting for these
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
nonsense Wars that do nothing to protect
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
us at home before committing the lives
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
of our Guardsmen these men and women
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
signed up to defend us the least we can
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
do is vote OTP to show we are defending
 
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
them I'm happy to answer any of your
 
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.010 align:start position:0%
them I'm happy to answer any of your
questions

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020 align:start position:0%

thank you representative questions
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%

um we discussed this bill at our meeting
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
on January the 3rd and and we said it
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
sounds a lot like HB 1092 from the last
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
session and I was given permission at
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
that meeting to say that we don't
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I was also given
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
permission to contact uh representative
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
potusik as the bill sponsor and say that
 
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
we do not support this bill as a veteran
 
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
Community here in New Hampshire and and
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
give him the reasons why title 10 of U.S
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
law I'm going to let Colonel Perry he's
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to testify later talk to you about
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
title 10 and how that that really
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
applies here but it title 10 is is the
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
law and it's not it's not really
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
optional you know post Desert Storm
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
we we downsized the military quite a bit
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
and to be perfectly honest right now
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
Garden Reserve forces are not nice to
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
have forces for our government they're
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
they're must-have forces the tankers we
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
have sitting on the ramp over at peace
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
you know Governor sununu didn't write a
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
check for those okay we those are Air
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
Force assets and they're part of the air
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
bridge to to Europe and those things are
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
in operation all the time supporting
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
real world uh missions
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
um we particularly take exception in the
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
in the state veterans advisory committee
 
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:17.579 align:start position:0%
to congress not really doing their job
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
just because they haven't exercised
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
their article one authority to declare
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
war okay to give you a very brief
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
history lesson in August of 1964
 
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
we had a couple of North Vietnamese
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
Patrol boats that fired on a U.S Navy
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
ship in the Gulf of Tonkin and for their
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
time in trouble they were both sunk but
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
President Johnson went to the Congress
 
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
and said they are shooting at our boys
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
over here and the Congress said all
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
right we're going to pass the Gulf of
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
Tonkin Resolution and we're going to
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
give you essentially a blank check to do
 
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
whatever you want when the war was over
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
in 1973 the Congress rethought that idea
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
and said that was really not a very good
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
idea at all so they passed the War
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
Powers Act of 1973 which basically says
 
00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
the president can go any place he needs
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
to or she needs to for 60 days
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
and use military force where that's
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
necessary after that 60-day period also
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
subject to 30 days bringing everybody
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
home you have to come and tell us what
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
you're doing or we're going to cut the
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
money off
 
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
this bill when I did some research on it
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
this bill was actually passed sent to
 
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
President Nixon he vetoed it it went
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
back to the Congress and they overrode
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
his veto and said we're in charge of
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
this stuff so we're gonna we're gonna go
 
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
ahead and do this if you'll remember in
 
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
your history why did President George
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
H.W bush go to the Congress and get an
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
authorization to use military force
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
before Desert Storm required to by the
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
War Powers Act same song second verse
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
for President George W bush for both
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan and Iraq
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of extensive
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
coordination goes goes that goes around
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
when we send folks into combat zones or
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
when we just send people anywhere that
 
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
deploy that the governor's always kept
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
aware of all of those things and there's
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
very extensive coordination there
 
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
the truth of the matter is
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
this bill is not going to get what the
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
sponsors behind me want it to do if you
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
want to to prevent you know the idea
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
that you think that Congress isn't doing
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
their job then then we have four
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly good members of our
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation that can
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
introduce that legislation for you on a
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
federal level and see if we can change
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
title 10. as it is right now we're not
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
going to change title 10 of U.S law from
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
Concord all right you want to do that
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to be at the federal
 
00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
level it's not going to be at the state
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
level at the state level I'll tell you
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
what they'll do what they'll do is
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
they'll say well
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
if you don't want to if you don't want
 
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
to play we're just going to take our
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
toys and go home that's the same thing
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
they threatened with the folks over at
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
Burlington when they had already spent
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars to build facilities
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
for the new F-35 over there and they had
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
a group of citizens that said you know
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
we think that's going to be too loud
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
we'd rather have you put something
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
quieter in here so we'll whip back
 
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:08.339 align:start position:0%
everything up and move it and shut the
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
Vermont guard down if you want to and
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
then they decided Well no okay maybe
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
we'll uh we'll bring the f-35s in which
 
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
by the way they don't take off in after
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
Burger most of the time anyway so it's
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
not that loud it's not louder than F-16
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
anyway that's really all I wanted to
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
tell you because I know Kurt there's a
 
00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
lot of people that want to talk in
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
Colonel Perry is going to talk some
 
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
other things about title 10 and but we
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
do not support this legislation like we
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
did in support 1092 like we didn't
 
00:54:33.119 --> 00:54:34.250 align:start position:0%
did in support 1092 like we didn't
support

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
580 in the previous in the previous
 
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
three sessions there's been three
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
consecutive two two previous were itl
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%

are in there and these are names that
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%

association of the U.S army the uh the
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%

once a year to uh to the legislature on
 
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:31.500 align:start position:0%

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
questions for Colonel Grady
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh Colonel I have a quick question I
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
know we have a lot of folks who want to
 
00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
testify but I you referenced uh
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
president H W bush in 1990 going to
 
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
Congress for the uh off Force
 
00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
authorization which passed nearly my
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances at the time uh gave me
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
extreme interest in that vote uh my
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
understanding is the general uh
 
00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
President Bush at that time said that
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
had in this past narrowly particularly
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
in the U.S Senate uh the authorization
 
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
for the use of force in 1990 Desert
 
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.109 align:start position:0%
for the use of force in 1990 Desert
Shield

00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
Shield
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
the president reportedly said that had
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
congress not authorized that use of
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
force he was going to use Force anyway
 
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
do you recollect him saying that I I
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
don't recollect that I was on the wrong
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
side of the uh of the of the the world I
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
was in uh Okinawa and I was actually
 
00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
sitting on Alert in South Korea when uh
 
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
when the actual fighting started on the
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
15th of January of uh 91 so I didn't I
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
did not follow that no sir okay I see
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
some heads nodding in the back uh
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
because that was my recollection and of
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
course it was a moot point it passed but
 
00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:48.059 align:start position:0%
had it not passed that is something that
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
remains of concern to folks was that
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
President Bush said he was going to go
 
00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
ahead anyway he's not here God Rest his
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
soul but uh thank you uh
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
Noah Blanchette is here
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh welcome to state federal and veterans
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman good morning members
 
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a whole ton to say I
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
just wanted to come today and give my
 
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
support for the bill I come from a Small
 
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:26.579 align:start position:0%
Town of Antrim New Hampshire I'm a
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
former National Guard member for six
 
00:57:29.339 --> 00:57:30.650 align:start position:0%
former National Guard member for six
years

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
um and I think what this bill's doing is
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
a good thing I don't believe that we
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
should be deploying the guard
 
00:57:42.049 --> 00:57:42.059 align:start position:0%
to these combat scenarios without formal
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
declaration of war
 
00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.809 --> 00:57:49.819 align:start position:0%
I don't know I just think it's kind of a
 
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
difficult gray area
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
whereas we could um navigate that by
 
00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
following uh
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
the things we have written in the
 
00:58:00.599 --> 00:58:01.849 align:start position:0%
the things we have written in the
Constitution

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan veteran hat uh with my
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
Combat Action Badge on it I served I'm
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
here today
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
um as a veteran which is why I'm not in
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
the normal suit and tie decorum uh I I
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
was a 33 and a 33 year four-month
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
veteran exactly one third of a century
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
a little over half of that was in the
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
garden the Reserve I retired as a
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Colonel army guy after
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
volunteering for a deployment into
 
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan I did two mobilizations
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
after 9 11.
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh when you're in Afghanistan at night
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
you have cigars and fake beer to think
 
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
about things and so I spent a lot of
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
time thinking about the Constitution one
 
01:00:05.329 --> 01:00:05.339 align:start position:0%
of the things I've I that I think is
 
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
important to remember and I think you'll
 
01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:09.020 align:start position:0%
get this as a history
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
professional Mr chair is the reason that
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
we gave congress the right to or the
 
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
power to declare war in our constitution
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
it's because the scholars of the 1700s
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
had seen kings abuse the ability to
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
use conflicts with external parties as a
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
way to keeping the rabble from rousing
 
01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.829 align:start position:0%
way to keeping the rabble from rousing
and

01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
um and because leaders tend to know that
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
the most effective way to unign a a
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
population is to find a common enemy and
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
so leaders throughout history and into
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
the future will use that reality of
 
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
human behavior when needed to to Rally
 
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
people behind them by finding a common
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
enemy and so it was deemed important to
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
keep the executive from having that
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
unilateral power and put it back into
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
the hands of the people where it belongs
 
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm fully in support of the
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
concept and principles of this bill
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
because I I think we've had a poor
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
history of of compliance with that
 
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
important belief and to your earlier
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
point about President Bush saying he
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
would go forward even without the
 
01:01:30.839 --> 01:01:31.870 align:start position:0%
would go forward even without the
Congressional

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
Congressional
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
authorization I think that would have
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
been a fascinating Supreme Court case
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know and I think he would have lost
 
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
that because he would have directly
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
thumbed his nose at a very specific part
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
of our constitution so so what we have
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
done and what the Supreme Court has
 
01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.890 align:start position:0%
done and what the Supreme Court has
recognized

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
is that rather than declaration of war
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
as long as the Congress was showing an
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
affirmative step towards authorizing the
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
military force and the Supreme Court has
 
01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
ruled even a new appropriation
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
specifically to deploy the force and to
 
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
arm the force that that's sufficient and
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
so I I won't step on the Supreme Court
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
because I think they know it better than
 
01:02:18.849 --> 01:02:18.859 align:start position:0%
I do and I and and maybe
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
starting on line 22 were the or Clause
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
is put in or has taken an official
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
action pursuant to Article 1 Section 8
 
01:02:32.329 --> 01:02:32.339 align:start position:0%
Clause 15. you know that that may if if
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
I were a scholar a
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
supreme court scholar I I'm I could tell
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
you whether or not that was adequate to
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
ensure that some Congressional actionist
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
is needs to be taken and I don't think
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
it needs to be the formal declaration of
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
war that's not the way the Supreme Court
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
is interpreted but just some affirmative
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
action and
 
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:56.809 align:start position:0%
action and
um

01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
so I if if that is adequate I I don't
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
know that I would have a problem uh with
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
um and I I think the fiscal note as much
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
as I respect the people who put the
 
01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes together in the process
 
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
used I I I think it's a hypothetical I
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
think it's definitely the worst case
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
scenario uh I think if New Hampshire
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
simply told Congress and the president
 
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
that we expect them to take an
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
affirmative action before sending our
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
guard into Harm's Way that that would be
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
perceived to be a reasonable position
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
and so I I would encourage you to think
 
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
about this in terms of history and
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
principles of our Constitution and not
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
not not let this money issue distracts
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
you from what I think is really the
 
01:03:51.549 --> 01:03:51.559 align:start position:0%
important argument here
 
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
we we know we can't trust the federal
 
01:03:59.089 --> 01:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
government we we know that when we
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
bombed Libya for over 60 days nobody
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
asked for a declaration of the War
 
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
Powers Act and I think that was a huge
 
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
sin against our constitution and even
 
01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
our federal laws so so the the the the
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
the things that we have put in place
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
have continued to be flouted the two
 
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
Congressional authorizations to go into
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
the Middle East on uh
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
um enduring Freedom
 
01:04:27.849 --> 01:04:27.859 align:start position:0%
um and the like uh have never
 
01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
expired they could call up under those
 
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
same authorizations today and re ignite
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
a war in anywhere from uh you know Syria
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
to Iraq uh to to Libya apparently so
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
um it's way too broad it gives way too
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
much discretion to the president to
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
Rally the American people behind the
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
flag to to find a common enemy and take
 
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
us into war and we should recognize that
 
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
and resist that I believe
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
um so so if I were if I were better at
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
this if I knew what the Supreme Court
 
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
precedents were around interpreting
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
article on Section 8 Clause 15
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
Provisions uh I I could tell you if I
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
supported this outright or if it needed
 
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
an amendment but
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
if if this committee it yelled it I
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
could understand that if you amended it
 
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
I could understand that I just I just
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
want to say that there is a very
 
01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh argument and conversation
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
that we should be having around this
 
01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.690 align:start position:0%
that we should be having around this
because

01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
um you know the power to send people
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
into combat is an awesome power and
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
we've put controls in place for a very
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
valid historical purpose so that that's
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative we'll take any
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
questions I I will are there any
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Finney thank
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um you know thank you
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
for being here Jess um
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
my one question and I'm hoping I'm not
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
being redundant here
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
um we're we're talking to the Congress
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
about trying to limit the scope of their
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
powers back to the to our one of the
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution but this then
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
affected the executive
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
um from issuing an executive order that
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
would override Congress and that our
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
governor would would have to comply with
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
could we say you know could we still say
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
no at that point well okay so I uh
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
representative Finney I appreciate the
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
question and I'm going to disclaim my
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
answer I I I'm not an attorney I'm just
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
a Layman who's been reading
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
constitutional law for about 30 years
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
out of sort of uh interest
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
um and and and what I would say is that
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
if uh we had an instance where Congress
 
01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
had explicitly had an opportunity to
 
01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:56.339 align:start position:0%
take an affirmative action to to fund or
 
01:06:58.609 --> 01:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
otherwise support an aggressive military
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
action and chose not to that if the
 
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
president were to issue an executive
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
order uh to to try to overcome that it
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's my belief that the current makeup
 
01:07:14.809 --> 01:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
of the Supreme Court would likely uh
 
01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
rule against the executive order because
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
it would be such an egregious and
 
01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.730 align:start position:0%
it would be such an egregious and
obvious

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:21.740 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
refutation of the of the declared powers
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the Congress I think I want a
 
01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
clarification on that because uh that
 
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
part is is more important in my opinion
 
01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.510 align:start position:0%
part is is more important in my opinion
because

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
um we have an executive branch who's
 
01:07:36.529 --> 01:07:36.539 align:start position:0%
overtaking their power a little bit too
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
much and so I want to make sure that
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
we're checking that power as well as the
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
the the power of of Congress to make
 
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
these uh orders and I I I I I I think
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
the the process of having this
 
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
legislation considered is a good
 
01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:54.299 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity for the
 
01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:56.339 align:start position:0%
legislature and even if it were to pass
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
I think it's real effect and the real
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
world would be pretty negligible because
 
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is is a small element of
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
our overall defense posture uh we might
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
make the national news and we might get
 
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
some other states to think about this
 
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:15.059 align:start position:0%
um you know the sanctuary movement for
 
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
illegal immigration started with a
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
single State you know you never know
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
when the power of a good idea might
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
catch fire but if we're kind of isolated
 
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
and taken this action I don't I don't
 
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
think it will have any practical real
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
world effect
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
Cena thank you representative Edwards
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%

representative Edwards can we get a pink
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%

01:09:01.739 --> 01:09:03.709 align:start position:0%
what did you just

our communities they serve with pride
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
distinction and courage rarely matched
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
in Washington only earlier this month
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
the National Guard operated mobile

Guard citizen soldiers are an essential
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
part of operations in New Hampshire this
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
is just a recent selection only in the
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
last several months of all the valuable
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
Services provided by national Guardsmen
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
and these are all services that they
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
cannot provide if they are deployed for
 
01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
combat on the opposite side of the
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
planet from the communities that rely on
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
them this legislation aims to fix that
 
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
by requiring Congress to provide an
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
actual declaration of war before
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
National Guardsmen are deployed into
 
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.350 align:start position:0%
National Guardsmen are deployed into
combat

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
combat
 
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
Congress has not bothered to actually
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
declare a war since 1942. despite this
 
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
thousands upon thousands upon thousands
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
of soldiers have been sent to their
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
deaths on the opposite side of the
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
planet since the start of the global war
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
on terror National Guardsmen make up 45
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
percent of all deployed American
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
combatants and unfortunately make up 18
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
percent of the deaths so that's roughly
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
one in five dead soldiers that are done
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
overseas is from the National Guard
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
with their lives they unfortunately buy
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire absolutely nothing the
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is simple if New
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families are depart forever
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
with their beloved Sons and Daughters
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
then Congress should have to the courage
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
to actually declare war first if
 
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
Congress is too cowardly to declare a
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
war if the political shrapnel is too
 
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
difficult to face then Granite State
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
family should not be forced to send
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
their kids out to face real shrapnel
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
Everyone likes to read news articles
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
about mobile Dentistry units and heroic
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
staff sergeant saving people from cars
 
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
no one likes to read news stories about
 
01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
our brave young people dying somewhere
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
they ought not be in the first place
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
this legislation ensures more of the
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
former and less of the latter you may
 
01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
hear arguments today about how this
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
threatens Federal funding if you're
 
01:11:35.209 --> 01:11:35.219 align:start position:0%
worried about that let the fiscal
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee figure it out I do not believe
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
that the federal legislators from this
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
state would ever authorize decreasing
 
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
the funding for the National Guard
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
especially since all they have to do to
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
utilize our National Guard is simply
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
declare war
 
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
you may hear arguments today about how
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
the Air National Guard is important for
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
refueling Jets this is not impacted by
 
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
this bill whatsoever this bill is about
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
combat refueling planes is not combat as
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster put it it'll be a solemn
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
duty of the state governments to protect
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
their own authority over their own
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
militia and to interpose between their
 
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
citizens and arbitrary power I request
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
my name is Jason Gerhard representing
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
Northfield Franklin
 
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
and I want to address something I heard
 
01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
has heard from the colonel I believe it
 
01:12:56.219 --> 01:12:57.169 align:start position:0%
has heard from the colonel I believe it
was

01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:57.179 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
about the Gulf of Tonkin so this is from
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
the U.S naval Institute just the opening
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph to their article questions
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
about the Gulf of Tonkin incident have
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
persisted for more than 40 years but
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
once classified documents and tapes
 
01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
released in the past several years
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
combined with previously uncovered facts
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
made clear that high government
 
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
officials and distorted facts and
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
deceive the American public about events
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
that led to the full U.S involvement in
 
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
the Vietnam War this is pretty open
 
01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
information I don't know if anybody
 
01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
actually looked into it but the Gulf of
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
Tonkin thing is kind of so using that as
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
a justification for setting National
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
Guard our neighbors overseas on some
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
specious Wars and the other thing I
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to address
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
was President Eisenhower's farewell
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
address just very briefly
 
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
this conjunction of an immense military
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
establishment and a large arms industry
 
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
is new in the American Experience the
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
total influence economic political even
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
spirituals felt in every city every
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
state house
 
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
every Office of the federal government
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
we recognize this imperative need for
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
this development we yet we must not fail
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
to comprehend his grave implications our
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
toil resources and livelihood are all
 
01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
involved so is a very structure of our
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
society in the councils of government we
 
01:14:08.689 --> 01:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
must guard against the acquisition of
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
unwarranted influence whether sought or
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
unsought by the military-industrial
 
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.310 align:start position:0%
unsought by the military-industrial
complex

01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
complex
 
01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
potential for this disastrous rise of
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
misplaced power exists and will persist
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
it goes on and it gets better but the
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
point being is there's obviously
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
the powers that ought not be are trying
 
01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.390 align:start position:0%
the powers that ought not be are trying
to

01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
threaten us and scare us into the idea
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
that we're going to lose everything we
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
have if we don't go along with
 
01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.530 align:start position:0%
have if we don't go along with
Washington's

01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
Washington's
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
dictates we have to stand up and why do
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
we why are the flags in the state house
 
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
when we walk through the Hall of flags
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
what are they there for
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
I mean people have died for the things
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
that we're doing right now debating and
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
actually looking at hey you know this is
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
the Constitution this is what they
 
01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
actually swore an oath to uphold which
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
everyone in here did we already
 
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the federal
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
government's not following it I mean we
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
can kind of you know what I mean I don't
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
understand the point of why this is even
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
Up For Debate they're not following the
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
law okay done bring our troops home we
 
01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
can send them back you know we can get
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
our next flight back as soon as they
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
pass that resolution so I just I don't
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
know I don't see how this is that
 
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
complicated so thank you very much for
 
01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
your time and uh
 
01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
I'm done you take any questions if
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
they're already I doubt there will be
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
but I guess I will are there questions
 
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to ask good questions you
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
know because this is an important issue
 
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that we need to stay engaged
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
in this is someone that that's also
 
01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
served and I appreciate all you guys
 
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
being involved why do you think in your
 
01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
purview that the federal government has
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
taken up guard units instead of active
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
duty units to to send to these places is
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
it because
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're trying to find a loophole in the
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
law or is it because it's cheaper for
 
01:15:46.729 --> 01:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
them to send us
 
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
I think it's a little bit different I
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
think that people who join National
 
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
Guard so my twin brother enlisted at 17
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I actually was in the Army for two
 
01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
and a half weeks long story but the
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
point being is I think National Guard
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
troops tend to join more for patriotic
 
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
reasons and during my time when people
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
were talking about why they enlisted it
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
seemed that the active the active Army
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
was more economic Reasons from what I've
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
seen and there was some just you know
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
some crazy people in there too but
 
01:16:12.649 --> 01:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
um the National Guard people seem to be
 
01:16:12.659 --> 01:16:14.030 align:start position:0%
um the National Guard people seem to be
more

01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
it just seems to be more homebody type
 
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
like real
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
patriotic people and I think it's easier
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
to get them enlisted than active duty
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
does that I don't know if that makes any
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
sense but
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
is that I'm probably not wording it
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
right but it just so
 
01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.750 align:start position:0%
right but it just so
yes

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
see none thank you representative uh and
 
01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
now uh Warren Perry uh who opposes the
 
01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:46.130 align:start position:0%
now uh Warren Perry uh who opposes the
bill

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:47.630 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair for the record uh
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
Warren Perry Deputy Edge in general for
 
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire's Department of
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and Veterans Services
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for the opportunity to testify
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
today thanks for your service and thanks
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
to the service uh of all the people who
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
have testified here before me I like to
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
say before I give my formal remarks I'd
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
like to just kind of make comments on
 
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
testimony that you heard already today
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
first of all I take exception to the
 
01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
fact that people don't join the regular
 
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
army for patriotic reasons I serve 28
 
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
years in a regular army I consider
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
myself a patriot
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
and I consider all the people who serve
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
in our Armed Forces Patriots whether
 
01:17:22.729 --> 01:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
they're in the reserve components the
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
regular components wherever so uh
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
economic reasons may be a general
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
generating Factor but I'm sure that many
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
people join the National Guard for the
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
education benefits that we have here in
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
the states
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
so making that broad brush statement is
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh I just thought I'd address it on the
 
01:17:39.659 --> 01:17:40.610 align:start position:0%
uh I just thought I'd address it on the
record

01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:42.470 align:start position:0%
record
uh

01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
second thing I'd like to say is I'm not
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
aware you heard testimony earlier about
 
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
the ACLU and other states and other
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
people supporting this this act I'm not
 
01:17:50.689 --> 01:17:50.699 align:start position:0%
aware of any other state that's passed a
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
similar act I'd have to do a little more
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
research but as of last year when the
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
bill when the similar bill came before
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
the house there wasn't any and I don't
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
think any have passed this since then
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
the next thing I'd like to address is
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
the term instrumentality of War it is a
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
military Dragon piece but I would tell
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
you that the men and women who are
 
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
supporting the air Bridge across the
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
North Atlantic are instrumentalities of
 
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
War they're refueling aircraft that are
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
going to directly participate in actions
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
and combat actions or other actions
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
across the uh around the globe
 
01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
and I think that this would impact our
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
ability to perform that mission without
 
01:18:32.689 --> 01:18:32.699 align:start position:0%
a declaration of war not necessarily for
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
just pulling things in the Pacific but
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
certainly as we prepare to refuel and
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
station an aircraft around the world to
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
support that mission uh and extend the
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh the air capability of our planes in
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
the air certainly would have an impact
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
on that particular piece so to answer
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
your question there
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
next I'd like to talk a little bit about
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
status you heard about title 10 and
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
title 32 status and in fact that
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
testimony was correct I would just like
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
to clarify and be precise and say State
 
01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
active duty is neither title 10 or title
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
32. both titled you know title 32 is a
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
state status federally funded
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
title 10 is a federal status federally
 
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
funded and state active duty is a state
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
status state funded so we can't lump
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
title 32 in state active duty together
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
and the example I'll give is the coveted
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
response was a title 32 status under the
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
control of the governor federally funded
 
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
so that's that's how that works so all
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of the National Guard
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
that you got in this state that we got
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
in this state about 700 of them over the
 
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
course of the time of the mobilization
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
for that time to support was federally
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
funded and you know and would have been
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
federally funded regardless of this bill
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying that's the value
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
that they give I would also say that
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
those 700 Airmen and uh and army
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen Army and air Guardsmen that
 
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
were supporting that mission were doing
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
that while about 500 people were
 
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
deployed in support of global operations
 
01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
so the fact that we we can do both is
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
what I'm telling you the guard can do
 
01:20:12.659 --> 01:20:13.490 align:start position:0%
what I'm telling you the guard can do
both

01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
you know the backyard draft as some
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
people refer to it as we deploy folks is
 
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
not doesn't necessarily have the impact
 
01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
that people think it has and I know all
 
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
of you benefited from the guard and the
 
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
guard support during the coveted
 
01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
response while we were still persecuting
 
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
operations across the globe
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
I want to address the fiscal note a
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
little bit now we're in the fiscal note
 
01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
does it say that we will lose 365
 
01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars what it does say is that
 
01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
it puts that risk Federal funding in
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
that amount
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
so uh you know that's what it is so the
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
national Guardsmen have a dual Mission
 
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's not just to support the state there
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
not just the militia for the state our
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
national Guardsmen and women swear two
 
01:20:59.090 --> 01:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
Oaths they swear an oath to the
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution of United States of America
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the constitution of the State of New
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and both missions are equally
 
01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:07.739 align:start position:0%
important the federal funding and all
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
the things associated with it are
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
associated with our ability to to
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
provide forces to support the federal
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
Mission so when we talk about that
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it doesn't say the money's
 
01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
going to go away it says there's a
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
potential that it goes away and it's not
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know so I just a careful reading
 
01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
we'll kind of put that in perspective
 
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
so what I will say is that current
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
statutes right and I I particularly
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the testimony of uh Jess
 
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
Edwards who testified not as
 
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards but as Jess
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
Edwards and his constitutional uh
 
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
Scholars uh so before I make any other
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
four more marks I would just like to
 
01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
cite two cases there were two cases in
 
01:21:57.649 --> 01:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court one in 1820 Houston
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
versus more
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
and one in 1827 and I think it was a
 
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
habit right here bear with me
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
Martin versus Mott in both of those
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
cases the question of whether or not the
 
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219 align:start position:0%
president had the authority to activate
 
01:22:17.209 --> 01:22:17.219 align:start position:0%
the militia was the question the
 
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
background of those two cases were the
 
01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
president ordered people to militia to
 
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
to serve and uh soldiers disobeyed that
 
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
order and were punished for disobeying
 
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
the order of the president as in the
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
oath we swear obey the orders of the
 
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
president of the United States
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh and the orders of the officers have
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
pointed over you in both cases
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
uh based on an act that was passed in
 
01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.290 align:start position:0%
uh based on an act that was passed in
1795

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
1795
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court upheld Congress has
 
01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
exercised its Authority by authorizing
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
the president to call forth the militia
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
in case is mentioned in the Constitution
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
so that was Houston versus Moore 1820
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
and in mott Martin versus Mott the act
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
of 1795 provided that whenever the
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
United States shall be invaded or be an
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
eminent danger of Invasion From Any
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
foreign Nation or Indian tribe it shall
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
be lawful for the president of the
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
United States to call forth such number
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
of the militia of the states most
 
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
convenient to the place of danger or
 
01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
scene of action as he may judge
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
necessary to repel an invasion and I
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
would say that based on the
 
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
authorization authorization of use of
 
01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
force that cited in my written testimony
 
01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
that I think based on that the Supreme
 
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
Court this today would likely
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
stop have Starry decisions right they
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
would let those decisions stand based on
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
the precedent that was going on so as we
 
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
as we talk about this and we talk about
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality of the president
 
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
ordering the militia you know one of the
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
things we need to look at is whether or
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
not the con that U.S Congress is going
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
to rescind The Authority they have
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
delegated to the president in the
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
authorization of a force and I think
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
that that may be what's at issue here is
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
that the president has been delegated
 
01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
that Authority and maybe Congress needs
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
to do something about that if they deem
 
01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.770 align:start position:0%
to do something about that if they deem
necessary

01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
right now what the department hangs its
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
hat on is title 10 United States code
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
section 12 301
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
and in summary in my written testimony
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
it says the consent of the governor is
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
described in sections B and D this is so
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh bowlegs F in that in that citation
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
this uh the governor as in those
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
instances described in B and D above may
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
not be when held in whole or in part
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to active duty outside the
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
United States its territories its
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
possessions because of Any objection to
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
the location purpose or type uh or
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
schedule of that active duty so title 10
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
is clear right
 
01:24:58.729 --> 01:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
so so we're going to go back and kind of
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
look at the balance of powers right
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
Congress has been delegated powers in
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
the Constitution they delegate those Co
 
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
those powers to the president United
 
01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
States and the authorization use force
 
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
act or the other Act of 17 uh
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
95 the Supreme Court's ruled on it seems
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
like what I was taught in my Civics
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
classes we kind of worked it all out
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
right the balance of powers kind of they
 
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
they they work so if there's a violation
 
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution there the Supreme
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
Court hasn't found it seems like
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
Congress has delegated it and the
 
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
president has executed it and what we
 
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
need to change is whether or not
 
01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
Congress is going to
 
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:38.540 align:start position:0%
change this authorization
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know and as as uh Jess Edwards has
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
stated this bill's not going to have any
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
impact on that because the governor is
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
not going to have the power to withdraw
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
his consent based on title 10.
 
01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of where where we sit I
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
will tell you that the fiscal impact
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
that the federal government brings to
 
01:25:59.090 --> 01:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
significant right those airplanes cost a
 
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
lot of money particularly the new ones
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
that they have there all of the trucks
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
that we used are in covet they don't
 
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
belong to the state of New Hampshire
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
they belong to the federal government
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
and the federal government buys their
 
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
gas it buys all the money it takes to
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
train them and it spends all the money
 
01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
it takes to man them right so why would
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
we put that at risk because they can do
 
01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
like I said earlier both they can
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
support the state and obey the orders of
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
the president United States uh together
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
I am uh I am a 28-year veteran of the
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
United States Army I did deploy both to
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
Desert Storm and to operation Iraqi
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
freedom I lost men in combat like many
 
01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:43.580 align:start position:0%
of the men behind me did
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
and nobody wants to fight Wars less than
 
01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:49.610 align:start position:0%
and nobody wants to fight Wars less than
us

01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
but I don't see I can't see you know
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
based on my patriotism not following the
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
orders of the president and I don't see
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
that they're illegal based on the
 
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
citations that I've I've given you in
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
the comments that I've made so I'm happy
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions I I urge the
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
committee to to to
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
vote this inexperience to legislate as
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
written so if it's amended certainly
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
come back and talk to you again about it
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
and consider the Amendments but that's
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
my testimony sorry I drug on a little
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
long hopefully I made sense well I'm
 
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Perry questions
 
01:27:30.649 --> 01:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman uh representative gagne
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Colonel for taking my question
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is like an aside question aside
 
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
from the money potential losses
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh we had orientation last week where we
 
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
you came and and others presented that
 
01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
the Enlistment
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
was down
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh could it be my opinion I'm asking for
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
yours could it be because of all the
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
many freaking deployments that are being
 
01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.629 align:start position:0%
many freaking deployments that are being
made

01:27:59.629 --> 01:27:59.639 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
I I would tell you that everybody in the
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
Army and the Navy and the Marine Corps
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
and the Air Force and the space force
 
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
and the Coast Guard they're tired
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that right now and I
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
think that's having an absolute impact
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
on our ability to recruit our forces
 
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
there are many in my opinion right so in
 
01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
my opinion uh
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
I think what believe it or not and some
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
people don't necessarily like to hear
 
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
this and it was mentioned a little bit
 
01:28:28.729 --> 01:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
earlier some people joined the army
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
because for economic reasons
 
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the economy drives the
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
drives the the
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
enlistment pieces and it's been pretty
 
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.310 align:start position:0%
enlistment pieces and it's been pretty
good

01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
but the propensity to enlist is down and
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
our soldiers and Airmen are tired and I
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
would tell you it's not only having an
 
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
impact on our ability to recruit but
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
it's also having an impact on our
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
ability to retain
 
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
ER that's a short and sweet answer to
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
now the questions they're tired
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Perry okay we
 
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
have seven more cards here all seven are

you have taken time to be here I'll just
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
point out that if certain points that
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:29:17.290 --> 01:29:17.300 align:start position:0%
uh ready to state if they've been stated
 
01:29:20.209 --> 01:29:20.219 align:start position:0%
we'd really be looking for some some New
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
Perspectives and we'll go right now to

01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
that standing armies are dangerous to

Liberty and ought not be raised or kept
 
01:30:08.689 --> 01:30:08.699 align:start position:0%

01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
countless service men and women have
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
died in conflicts that have no specific

01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
Congressional approval as the

Constitution mandates
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can serve as a check
 
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
against this gross abuse of power by
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
retaining ownership of its National
 
01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
Guard only reserving them for foreign
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
deployment if there isn't officially
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
declared war by Congress so Congress can
 
01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
be held accountable to the American
 
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
people if they do not approve of the
 
01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:41.149 align:start position:0%
people if they do not approve of the
results

01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
as it stands there are huge
 
01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies in the executive branch
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
that perpetuate War for profit at the
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
expense of those that put their lives on
 
01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:48.900 align:start position:0%
the line believing that they are
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
defending this country in a manner that
 
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
is constitutionally permissible
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
this is not what the founding fathers
 
01:30:56.689 --> 01:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
intended and if Congress does not want
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
to change the Constitution then defend
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
the guard will restore a bit of the
 
01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
founding Vision incentivizing the
 
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
re-establishment of the process of War
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
rather than an endless cycle perpetuated
 
01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
by an unaccountable uncontrollable
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
viratic executive branch
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
war is a very serious matter and
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
deployment should only take place in
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances of self-defense defend the
 
01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
guard is a way of ensuring that this is
 
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
the case at least on a state level
 
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that war has not
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
officially been declared by Congress
 
01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
since World War II as previously
 
01:31:31.129 --> 01:31:31.139 align:start position:0%
mentioned this provides a check against
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
the Executive Branch from continuing to
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
perpetuate endless Wars and having the
 
01:31:37.729 --> 01:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
U.S military serve as a global police
 
01:31:37.739 --> 01:31:38.930 align:start position:0%
U.S military serve as a global police
force

01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:31:41.450 --> 01:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
if Congress wants this continued they
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
need to pass a constitutional amendment
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh to make it so not simply pass the War
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
Powers Act or any other legislation
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
that that has the same level of strength
 
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
as the US Constitution as we are a
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
nation of laws that must adhere to our
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional framework
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
Congress has failed to act and will
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
continue to fail to act on this
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandate as many of them
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
are personally benefited to see the war
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
machine continue even if it negatively
 
01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:11.219 align:start position:0%
affects New Hampshire and American
 
01:32:11.219 --> 01:32:12.890 align:start position:0%
affects New Hampshire and American
families

01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
having a Perpetual state of War through
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
the constant deployment of armed forces
 
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
including the National Guard actually
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
weakens National Security in my opinion
 
01:32:23.689 --> 01:32:23.699 align:start position:0%
by extending resources that
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
um when they are not needed and creating
 
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
enemies out of allies through
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary military intervention
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
I want my future children and
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
grandchildren to live in a world where
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
Nation shall not lift up the sword
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
against Nation neither shall they learn
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
War anymore
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
and I believe that defend the guard is a
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
great first step in ensuring this vision
 
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
therefore I encourage the committee to
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
make an OTP recommendation on HB 229 and
 
01:32:48.169 --> 01:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time and I'm open
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
to questions
 
01:32:54.370 --> 01:32:54.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your testimony for
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
showing up here appreciate that and
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
from Jerry representing himself in
 
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you committee for giving me the
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on HB 229 defend
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
the guard my name is Derek pru I'm from
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
Derry New Hampshire I'm a former
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
Sergeant in the New Hampshire Army
 
01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
National Guard served six years and I
 
01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
01:33:54.110 --> 01:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
now uh I'm going to start with a quote
 
01:33:57.169 --> 01:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
for from President James Madison the
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution supposes what the history
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
of all governments demonstrates that the
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
executive is the branch of power most
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
interested in war and prone to it it is
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
accordingly with studied care vested the
 
01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
question of war in the legislature
 
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
now I joined out of a sense of duty to
 
01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
protect uh foremost my state which is
 
01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:19.860 align:start position:0%
why I enlisted in the National Guard I
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure that I was there for
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
any kind of uh State emergency whether
 
01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
it be snow storms or flooding anything
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
like that and then of course to uphold
 
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
and defend the Constitution United
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
States which I have my Constitution
 
01:34:35.689 --> 01:34:35.699 align:start position:0%
right here open to Article 1 Section 8
 
01:34:38.209 --> 01:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
which clearly states that Congress has
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
the authority to declare war Grant
 
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
letters of Mark and reprisal make rules
 
01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:50.209 --> 01:34:50.219 align:start position:0%
um knowing this and uh while I was doing
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
overseas training mission in Hungary uh
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
I was part of a high Mars unit Third
 
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
Battalion one third of the 197th field
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
artillery Bravo battery
 
01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
um in my high Mars waiting on a fire
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
mission uh kind of just
 
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
looking through news see what's going on
 
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
in the world at the time and I came
 
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
across what was called the Pentagon
 
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
papers which was released by The
 
01:35:16.129 --> 01:35:16.139 align:start position:0%
Intercept and in the Pentagon papers it
 
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
was found that ninety percent of drone
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
strikes in the Middle East was not on
 
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
the intended target
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
90 and that mostly came from The
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
Whistleblower Airman Daniel Hale and so
 
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
learning that information uh and being
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
field artillery where a lot of our uh
 
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
intel was probably a lot of the same
 
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
Intel that these drone Pilots were
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
getting uh that really concerned me uh
 
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
in terms of my my service and so I
 
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
started really looking into uh the
 
01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
purpose of these wars in the Middle East
 
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
and what was going on uh the background
 
01:35:52.129 --> 01:35:52.139 align:start position:0%
and what I discovered was that these
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
wars were unconstitutional they were
 
01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
never declared like was previously
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
stated the last declaration of war was
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
World War II
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
and the Constitution is very clear about
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
what happens with war and Congress
 
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
should be the ones to declare war
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
and then uh you know reading about
 
01:36:12.169 --> 01:36:12.179 align:start position:0%
authorization for the use of military
 
01:36:12.179 --> 01:36:13.370 align:start position:0%
authorization for the use of military
force

01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
um it's not a war declaration it is uh
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
like it's been previously stated a blank
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
check it doesn't mention anything about
 
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh Geographic or uh budgetary or time
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
restraints or anything like that
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
um and you can clearly see that we've
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
been intermittently involved in places
 
01:36:36.169 --> 01:36:36.179 align:start position:0%
like Somalia since 1993 that's almost 30
 
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
years of military engagement and in
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
other places across the world
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
and so the real question is is can
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
Congress legislate away their
 
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional Authority
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
um some might say yes my assertion is
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
that no they can't do that they must
 
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
abide by the supreme law of the land
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
which is the United States Constitution
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
section one uh article one section 8
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
. I just wanted to address some things
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Perry mentioned uh repel invasions
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
this bill itself says that the president
 
01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
does have the authority to repel
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
invasions this bill doesn't try to
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
prevent that another thing is in title
 
01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
10 section 12 301 subsection F which
 
01:37:24.850 --> 01:37:24.860 align:start position:0%
mentions the government the governor
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
withholding their consent cannot
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
withhold their consent for location
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
purpose type or schedule of active duty
 
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
we're not asking that the governor do
 
01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
this we're asking if the governor
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
withhold this consent on the basis that
 
01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:41.100 align:start position:0%
Congress is not following the supreme
 
01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
law of the land we're not objecting to
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
location purpose type or schedule of
 
01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.629 align:start position:0%
location purpose type or schedule of
active

01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
active
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
um I also have right here
 
01:37:50.159 --> 01:37:51.709 align:start position:0%
um I also have right here
um I

01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
didn't print enough of these copies but
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
when this bill was introduced in Kansas
 
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
the uh Kansas Division of budget uh
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
their fiscal note was the adjutant
 
01:38:04.610 --> 01:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
General's Department states that the
 
01:38:07.729 --> 01:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
enactment of SB 370 that was their
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
version of this bill would not have a
 
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
fiscal effect so again other states are
 
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
saying that this is not going to have
 
01:38:16.209 --> 01:38:16.219 align:start position:0%
any effect any any
 
01:38:16.219 --> 01:38:18.010 align:start position:0%
any effect any any
budgetary

01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:18.020 align:start position:0%
budgetary
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
reprisals is purely speculation and then
 
01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
we can also look at in New Hampshire
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
with our you know not having a seat belt
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
law not re-numbering our exits uh not
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
having motorcycle helmets we're already
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
in that chicken fight with the
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
government over Federal funding of
 
01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
Highway budget which we've won we kind
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
of call their Bluff they're not
 
01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
withholding any funds from from those
 
01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:42.610 align:start position:0%
withholding any funds from from those
purposes

01:38:42.610 --> 01:38:42.620 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:44.390 align:start position:0%
purposes
and

01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to repeat this it is
 
01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
the solemn duty of the state government
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
to protect their own authority over
 
01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
their own militia and to interpose
 
01:38:54.169 --> 01:38:54.179 align:start position:0%
between their citizens and arbitrary
 
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
power that is our very own Daniel
 
01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:57.229 align:start position:0%
power that is our very own Daniel
Webster

01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%

01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:00.360 align:start position:0%

from the committee
 
01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
I would also like to say that training
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
mission in Hungary this bill would not
 
01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
affect that training Mission overseas
 
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
training is not affected by The Spill
 
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:13.980 align:start position:0%

01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
I have watched American soldiers bleed
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
to death while our Medics worked on them
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%

for us and for our
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
audience on the world wide web Alec
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
Leone sir yes that was correct
 
01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.050 align:start position:0%
Leone sir yes that was correct
um

01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today in support of this
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
bill uh as a former member of the New
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.639 --> 01:41:49.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:50.810 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:53.169 --> 01:41:53.179 align:start position:0%
the military power of the United States
 
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
is extremely
 
01:41:59.570 --> 01:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
large and Powerful it is uh almost
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
without match
 
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
and I feel the ways it's been used over
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
the past decades
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
um have been extremely irresponsible and
 
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
as previously previously stated
 
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
questionably constitutional at best
 
01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:17.689 align:start position:0%
questionably constitutional at best
um

01:42:17.689 --> 01:42:17.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:17.699 --> 01:42:19.310 align:start position:0%
um
while

01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
the units from the New Hampshire
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
National Guard might not make up a
 
01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.129 align:start position:0%
National Guard might not make up a
massive

01:42:25.129 --> 01:42:25.139 align:start position:0%
massive
 
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
portion of that might and power
 
01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:30.950 align:start position:0%
portion of that might and power
um

01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
I believe it's our duty at least to stop
 
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
enabling this uh
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
irresponsible Behavior where we can
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
even if that's just for the sake of our
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
neighbors and friends and family here
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
would you take any questions if there
 
01:42:53.450 --> 01:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
are any
 
01:42:57.050 --> 01:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
and saying none at Alec thank you as

so that's just uh I'm here as well but
 
01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:58.970 align:start position:0%
so that's just uh I'm here as well but
um

01:44:58.970 --> 01:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
would I I want to Echo what uh
 
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative Manion said
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
um also some um I've forgotten your name
 
01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:08.209 align:start position:0%
um also some um I've forgotten your name
Zephyr

01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
Zephyr
 
01:45:10.609 --> 01:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
um spoke very eloquently to how I feel
 
01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:13.139 align:start position:0%
about this and I I wanted to add a few
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
things that I don't think are in the in
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
the conversation
 
01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
um one is is that
 
01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:21.229 align:start position:0%
um one is is that
um

01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
when we talk about constitutionality
 
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
we're talking about who has the power to
 
01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
declare Wars
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
um we also have article six the U.S
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution which
 
01:45:32.689 --> 01:45:32.699 align:start position:0%
um which which says we have to follow
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
International treaties and included in
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
ratified uh International treaties is
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
the UN Charter
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
um which which uh is maybe the reason
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
why we haven't engaged uh in in
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
declaring Wars
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
um because it's very clear that it's
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
illegal to attack another country to put
 
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
your troops in another country under
 
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
that Charter and under article 6 of our
 
01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
own Constitution
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and so I when we talk about what
 
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're you know what what missions are uh
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
being executed the US is supporting
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
things like the the war in Yemen the
 
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
saudi-led offensive there uh over a
 
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand people per year over
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
the last uh five or six years have died
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
of starvation and an engineered cholera
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
epidemic by the Saudi government that's
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that sometimes we're
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
doing we spend 858 billion that's our
 
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
current national defense authorization
 
01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
act 858 billion with a B that's more
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
than six times that of China more than
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
10 times that of Russia we have troops
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
in over 700 countries around the world
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
most of those on bases but we have uh
 
01:46:39.169 --> 01:46:39.179 align:start position:0%
kinetic operations and over a dozen
 
01:46:39.179 --> 01:46:40.729 align:start position:0%
kinetic operations and over a dozen
countries

01:46:40.729 --> 01:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
countries
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and that uh isn't the it's it's not
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
um no and I want to go to a conversation
 
01:46:49.250 --> 01:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
that I had with Colin Powell's Chief of
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
Staff Lawrence Wilkerson
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
um and Larry spent the night at my house
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
while he was in New Hampshire talking
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
about the revolving door and and the
 
01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
reality that military keynesianism this
 
01:47:02.450 --> 01:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
this reality that we've had penned on
 
01:47:05.209 --> 01:47:05.219 align:start position:0%
jobs and politicians to defend depend
 
01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:07.139 align:start position:0%
especially at the federal level on
 
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
contributions from Pentagon contractors
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
and that growth of the military sector
 
01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:16.139 align:start position:0%
of manufacturing is a is something that
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
our economic system continues to grow
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
increasingly dependent on this bill
 
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm not a constitutional
 
01:47:26.930 --> 01:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
scholar and I don't know what the
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
Constitutional law is what I know is is
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
what's right and wrong and that any
 
01:47:33.169 --> 01:47:33.179 align:start position:0%
roadblocks we can put in to the
 
01:47:36.770 --> 01:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
executive to uh closening our ties with
 
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
the Saudis when it comes to the Warren
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
blockade there to bombing and killing in
 
01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
countries like Iraq and Syria and
 
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan where I engaged in combat in
 
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
Iraq multiple times
 
01:47:51.530 --> 01:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to keep New Hampshire
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
soldiers from having to do that I hope
 
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
that you have the courage to do it you
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
know whether or not this bill can do
 
01:48:01.129 --> 01:48:01.139 align:start position:0%
what it wants to do whether or not the
 
01:48:03.169 --> 01:48:03.179 align:start position:0%
federal government pushes back and finds
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
a way to deploy our troops anyway
 
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
putting a small roadblock in and saying
 
01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:09.659 align:start position:0%
hey maybe maybe we shouldn't be engaged
 
01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
in combat in 13 countries is an act of
 
01:48:14.689 --> 01:48:14.699 align:start position:0%
Courage that you who are I mean when it
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
comes to legislatures when it comes to
 
01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
elected officials New Hampshire has the
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
people who are most tied into their
 
01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
constituents and and who are most able
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
to do what's morally right because
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
they're not dependent on those big
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
contributions from Raytheon and Bae and
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
General Dynamics and I hope you guys
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
have the courage to do the right thing
 
01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
and vote ought to pass and I'm happy to
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you will questions for will
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
Cena thank you for taking the time to
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
come down here on this uh on this snowy
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
day our final pink card on this measure
 
01:48:53.450 --> 01:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
is uh in favor of the bill from Gabe
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
Holden is Gabe here
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.689 --> 01:49:11.699 align:start position:0%
so uh I've been poor my entire life and
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
I don't represent them but I can tell
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
you what that perspective is like and
 
01:49:19.609 --> 01:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
the reason that matters is because
 
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
it is disproportionately the poor that
 
01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
joined the services
 
01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:25.550 align:start position:0%
joined the services
and

01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
when they join the National Guard
 
01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
they make an agreement with you
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
that they will guard the nation that
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
means two things that means that one
 
01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
they will not do things other than guard
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
the nation they will not be the toy
 
01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
soldiers of political Elites in
 
01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:46.129 align:start position:0%
soldiers of political Elites in
Washington

01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:46.139 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
01:49:49.609 --> 01:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
and number two that they will guard the
 
01:49:52.609 --> 01:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
nation when it needs to be guarded I
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
mean I think we all know that Warfare
 
01:49:58.609 --> 01:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
has changed and sure sometimes there is
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
a nation that is a threat to this one
 
01:50:05.689 --> 01:50:05.699 align:start position:0%
and in those cases it's not hard to
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
declare war
 
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
and when that's war is declared that is
 
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
when that guard needs to be there
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
but there are other threats it is not
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
always a nation that we go
 
01:50:20.330 --> 01:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
to defend ourselves from
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
and yeah they are authorized the the
 
01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court authorized the president
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
to repel that means to drive back to
 
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
drive them out of this country you don't
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
repel an invasion from going to their
 
01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:39.470 align:start position:0%
repel an invasion from going to their
home

01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:42.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
when

01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
we make those choices and and yes a lot
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
of the the economic choice is the
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
education that you receive because it is
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
one of the most effective ways to get
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
yourself out of the bottom bracket
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
but you made an agreement with them
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking that you keep that
 
01:51:01.679 --> 01:51:04.609 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking that you keep that
agreement

01:51:04.609 --> 01:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to point out that as far as
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
I can tell everyone who opposes this are
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
the people who
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
benefit financially
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:22.129 --> 01:51:22.139 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to end my statement with a
 
01:51:24.850 --> 01:51:24.860 align:start position:0%

01:51:28.129 --> 01:51:28.139 align:start position:0%

war is a racket
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
its profits are reckoned in dollars and
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
the losses in lives
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%

I am here today to present HB 269 and

act relative to limiting The Authority
 
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire delegates to
 
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
policy-making conventions
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is also known as the faithful
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
delegate law is common sense legislation
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
to propose controls guidelines and guard
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
rails to limit The Authority of New
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire delegates to any Interstate or
 
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
Interstate policy-making convention the
 
01:54:52.729 --> 01:54:52.739 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is to ensure that
 
01:54:55.490 --> 01:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature defines
 
01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
the scope and sets limitations on the
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
role and authority of delegates
 
01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
representing the sovereignty of New
 
01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:04.790 align:start position:0%
representing the sovereignty of New
Hampshire

01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
a little bit of history about this bill
 
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
a previous version of this bill HB 148
 
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
passed both the House and Senate in
 
01:55:18.890 --> 01:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
2015. unfortunately Governor Hassan
 
01:55:21.169 --> 01:55:21.179 align:start position:0%
vetoed this bill because she said it was
 
01:55:23.209 --> 01:55:23.219 align:start position:0%
not required at the time
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
also in 2022 HB 1170 passed the house
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
but was tabled in the Senate so the text
 
01:55:36.729 --> 01:55:36.739 align:start position:0%
of this bill is the same as 1170.
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
and then as a an additional note in 2020
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
there was a Supreme Court decision
 
01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
chiafalo versus Washington and the U.S
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%

01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
that state legislatures maintained
 
01:55:56.689 --> 01:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
control over their appointed delegates
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
this bill has three main components to
 
01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
ensure the limitations of this Authority
 
01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
is followed number one it establishes a
 
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
procedure for the selection of delegates
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
number two it limits the authority of
 
01:56:16.250 --> 01:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
delegates to only those granted by the
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature and number
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
three it creates a procedure for
 
01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%

01:56:26.649 --> 01:56:26.659 align:start position:0%

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.370 align:start position:0%

limitations on Authority

discussed

01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
and the secretary of state is
 
01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
responsible for enforcing these policies
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
a few fiscal notes delegates are paid a
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars daily and reimbursed for
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
their actual expenses submitted the
 
01:59:49.089 --> 01:59:49.099 align:start position:0%
daily payment could be approximately
 
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
257 per delegate in addition to
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs
 
01:59:55.729 --> 01:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
and note that these Interstate
 
01:59:57.770 --> 01:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
conventions have been limited over the
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
past two years and these expense
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
anticipated expenditures are in are
 
02:00:07.850 --> 02:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
questionable at this time
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I urge the passage of this
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill to provide common sense legislation
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
to propose controls guidelines and guard
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
rails to select delegates limit The
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
Authority of New Hampshire delegates to
 
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
any Interstate policy-making convention
 
02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
and provide a procedure for recalling
 
02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
and replacing delegates that act outside
 
02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
the scope of the authority granted by
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature
 
02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and I will take questions
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Rose Jeff I do have a quick
 
02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:44.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Rose Jeff I do have a quick
question

02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:00:47.169 --> 02:00:47.179 align:start position:0%
um up front here the word interest
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
Interstate you used many times on line
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
four the title uh under chapter 20-c is
 
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
Authority of New Hampshire delegates to
 
02:01:01.250 --> 02:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
Interstate conventions now in line 12
 
02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
below that it refers to uh representing
 
02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
the people in state of New Hampshire at
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
any Interstate slash interest state
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
so my question or concern here is given
 
02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
that the word intra state is part of
 
02:01:21.050 --> 02:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
this measure uh in your speaking it
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
sounds like to Interstate I'm I'm
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
concerned and I think others may be
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about this applying to
 
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
intrastate could you speak to that yes
 
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
it the same policies procedures would
 
02:01:38.089 --> 02:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
apply to intrastate conventions but most
 
02:01:41.410 --> 02:01:41.420 align:start position:0%
of the examples that we know occur
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
Interstate but yes that is part of the
 
02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:45.950 align:start position:0%
Interstate but yes that is part of the
bill

02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:01:48.169 --> 02:01:48.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for that questions for the
 
02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor uh representative massimoa
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
if any other states who have already
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
signed on for an article 5 convention
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
application have these same prevent uh
 
02:02:07.850 --> 02:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
provisions and procedures in place or
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
are they different from what's presented
 
02:02:10.139 --> 02:02:11.030 align:start position:0%
are they different from what's presented
here

02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:02:13.609 --> 02:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
yes I believe they do however there are
 
02:02:17.169 --> 02:02:17.179 align:start position:0%
some expert experts that will testify
 
02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
specifically related to your question
 
02:02:23.689 --> 02:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Charlotte
 
02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:30.410 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
representative

02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
um we talked a lot about Article 5
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
conventions but this bill actually goes
 
02:02:37.970 --> 02:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
much further than a simple Article 5
 
02:02:41.149 --> 02:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
convention you mentioned for example ISO
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
New England would become under the
 
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
regulation of the legislature as well as
 
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
interstate as the chair mentioned and I
 
02:02:51.649 --> 02:02:51.659 align:start position:0%
suppose that could be a meeting of uh
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
registered Deeds from the 10th County
 
02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
could be determined to be an interstate
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
meeting does the legislature really want
 
02:03:00.649 --> 02:03:00.659 align:start position:0%
that product power
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
over the function of other
 
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
people in other groups
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sure that there needs to be a
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
threshold as to what specifically the
 
02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
inter or Interstate convention topics
 
02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:17.530 align:start position:0%
inter or Interstate convention topics
and

02:03:17.530 --> 02:03:17.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
criticality would be to
 
02:03:22.609 --> 02:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
be part of this bill so we could
 
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
certainly clarify that if it needs to be
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you but it's not meant to be a
 
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sherlock other

02:03:48.530 --> 02:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
penalties of these imposed when the oath
 
02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
was taken to just uh concentrate on what
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
the convention was convened for have you
 
02:03:57.890 --> 02:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
any ideas as to what those penalties
 
02:03:59.390 --> 02:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
removal from the there would be the
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
delegate would be removed there and this
 
02:04:11.229 --> 02:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
other questions

um maybe clarify for the rest of the
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee that that this bill
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
um that you could speak to that point of
 
02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:27.250 align:start position:0%
um that you could speak to that point of
water

02:04:27.250 --> 02:04:27.260 align:start position:0%

what what you can say here uh so the
 
02:04:40.729 --> 02:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
intent of your comment is I am asking a
 
02:04:46.030 --> 02:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
question uh our rules rather preclude
 
02:04:48.729 --> 02:04:48.739 align:start position:0%

02:05:54.290 --> 02:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
so I won't thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
hearing this testimony and considering
 
02:06:05.810 --> 02:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to repeat what I have
 
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
provided here in written form it's a on
 
02:06:13.129 --> 02:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
the technical side
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
but but behind this bill I find because
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
I've been on the phone probably for
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
three and a half weeks over the past
 
02:06:19.729 --> 02:06:19.739 align:start position:0%
three and a half weeks talking to
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
Republicans about this General topic of
 
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
the article 5 conventions uh authorized
 
02:06:27.050 --> 02:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
in the U.S Constitution
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
and and behind that discussion is
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
whether delegates can be trusted to do
 
02:06:34.250 --> 02:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
the work uh commissioned by the New
 
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature so this bill is
 
02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:37.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature so this bill is
important

02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
but but but the underlying
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh Pro Con on this bill seems to be
 
02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
melded together with whether one
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
supports the power in the Constitution
 
02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
under Article Five so I'll address that
 
02:06:49.070 --> 02:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
by asking you sort of a rhetorical
 
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
question to myself members of the
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee and to the public
 
02:06:54.890 --> 02:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
which is to what extent do you think
 
02:06:58.129 --> 02:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
Congress is doing a good job dealing
 
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
with major structural issues and I'll
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
just two examples national debt and
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
campaign money so I know that both of
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
these issues animate the public uh the
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
public at large bipartisan super
 
02:07:13.970 --> 02:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
majorities of the public support an
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
amendment to the U.S Constitution to
 
02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
deal with the debt problem and to deal
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
with the campaign money problem across
 
02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
the Spectrum so my question to myself
 
02:07:23.209 --> 02:07:23.219 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to the public
 
02:07:25.810 --> 02:07:25.820 align:start position:0%
do you think Congress is doing the job
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
of of tackling these issues and the
 
02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
answer is clearly no there's not a
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
single person that I've talked with in
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
three weeks and my 10 years of working
 
02:07:36.169 --> 02:07:36.179 align:start position:0%
on amending the Constitution in a
 
02:07:39.050 --> 02:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
variety of capacities uh that answers
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
the question favorably we're very
 
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
frustrated with Congress so this bill
 
02:07:48.890 --> 02:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
creates support it creates a sense of of
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
trust in the process laid out by the
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
framers of our United States
 
02:07:55.490 --> 02:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
Constitution which which told us As
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
Americans that should Congress fail to
 
02:07:59.629 --> 02:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
deal with major structural issues that
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
require amendments to the Constitution
 
02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
should Congress fail for whatever reason
 
02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:06.860 align:start position:0%
corruption or irresponsiveness
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
anticipated by the framers that the
 
02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
states would have the power to step in
 
02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh under a a procedure if two-thirds of
 
02:08:16.850 --> 02:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
the States agree on any particular
 
02:08:20.930 --> 02:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
subject uh to to appoint delegates and
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
the delegates are bound by the what's
 
02:08:26.030 --> 02:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
called an application by the states our
 
02:08:28.070 --> 02:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
state has a live application dating from
 
02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:29.290 align:start position:0%
state has a live application dating from
2012

02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:29.300 align:start position:0%
2012
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
asking for a convention for opposing
 
02:08:34.609 --> 02:08:34.619 align:start position:0%
amendments limited to the subject of
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
debt or budget balancing and so
 
02:08:39.530 --> 02:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
questions come up to what extent are
 
02:08:41.570 --> 02:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
these delegates under the control of the
 
02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature I'd argue that
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
based upon on case law and I've cited a
 
02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
particular case here and decided
 
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
unanimously by our Supreme Court in the
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
year 2020 that the legislature's
 
02:08:57.850 --> 02:08:57.860 align:start position:0%
application passed by this legislature
 
02:09:00.770 --> 02:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
binds the delegates appointed by the
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and by you folks
 
02:09:04.729 --> 02:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
here in the room this legislature to do
 
02:09:07.129 --> 02:09:07.139 align:start position:0%
the work contained in that application
 
02:09:11.290 --> 02:09:11.300 align:start position:0%
which is limited to the subject of of
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
budget balancing and debt restraint
 
02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
so that power in the hands you folks at
 
02:09:20.089 --> 02:09:20.099 align:start position:0%
the legislature already exists Supreme
 
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
Court is unanimously identified and
 
02:09:24.370 --> 02:09:24.380 align:start position:0%
confirmed that that exists but this bill
 
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
creates one extra layer of protection
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
and and and a sense of the safety of
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
this process This concerns about the
 
02:09:35.089 --> 02:09:35.099 align:start position:0%
safety of the states stepping in where
 
02:09:37.609 --> 02:09:37.619 align:start position:0%
Congress has utterly failed America to
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
deal with substantial significant issues
 
02:09:42.770 --> 02:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
structural issues Congress has failed we
 
02:09:44.530 --> 02:09:44.540 align:start position:0%
all agree on that at least I think so
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
this provides one extra layer of
 
02:09:50.089 --> 02:09:50.099 align:start position:0%
protection of safety of security so that
 
02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
you know you folks here in the
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
legislature who are commissioned to
 
02:09:55.729 --> 02:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
appoint these delegates that I as a
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
member of the public I can trust you to
 
02:09:59.689 --> 02:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
do a good job of appointing delegates
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
who will do the job that you've
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
commissioned them to do so for that
 
02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
reason I strongly support this bill and
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
of course you can hear that my focus is
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
on the Article 5 convention process
 
02:10:13.070 --> 02:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's where the main concerns
 
02:10:16.129 --> 02:10:16.139 align:start position:0%
are registered uh and so I'll I'll just
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony there except to
 
02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:19.980 align:start position:0%

process laid out by our framers of our
 
02:11:44.330 --> 02:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
constitution to deal with major
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
structural problems that Congress is
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
ducking your head on and that super
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%

thank you Senator I have a question
 
02:12:01.970 --> 02:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
um with regard to this measure which
 
02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
spells out a process a structure for
 
02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
delegate selection for an interstate
 
02:12:10.250 --> 02:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
convention uh
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
what is in place now
 
02:12:16.250 --> 02:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
um this is new language uh if if there
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
were a say a different measure move
 
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
forward for an article five or whatever
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
some sort of Interstate uh convention
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
um without this what do we have now that
 
02:12:31.089 --> 02:12:31.099 align:start position:0%
would cover this uh situation
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
deeply embedded a gentleman here will
 
02:12:35.149 --> 02:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
answer that type of thing but deeply
 
02:12:37.010 --> 02:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
embedded in the materials in the links
 
02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
to the links in this thing I've handed
 
02:12:42.169 --> 02:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
out here is a citation of a interesting
 
02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh summary of a book that was written
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the uh the amendment that
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
was passed uh to the 21st amendment that
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
repealed prohibition of alcohol and New
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire appointed delegates we
 
02:12:56.930 --> 02:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
appointed I think it was 10 delegates at
 
02:13:00.290 --> 02:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
the time we appointed and each state in
 
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
in the process of the state delegation
 
02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh empowered by Congress to ratify that
 
02:13:09.770 --> 02:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
21st Amendment each state had its own
 
02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
process so New Hampshire could the New
 
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature could choose its
 
02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
own process and is empowered to do so so
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
if this bill were not to pass you
 
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
already have that power in the
 
02:13:22.129 --> 02:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
legislature to determine how the
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
delegates would be appointed and that's
 
02:13:26.689 --> 02:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
flexible according to what you see this
 
02:13:26.699 --> 02:13:27.470 align:start position:0%
flexible according to what you see this
bill

02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
and again this is a this is a Belton
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
suspenders approach to increasing
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
confidence in the power of the states to
 
02:13:36.890 --> 02:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
resolve issues that Congress is ducking
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
and that will never Congress is in my
 
02:13:40.729 --> 02:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
opinion bought and paid for if that's
 
02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
just my opinion and that's why the
 
02:13:44.689 --> 02:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
states are allowed to step in so this
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
this creates a known identified
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
predetermined structure by which
 
02:13:52.970 --> 02:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
delegates could be appointed Etc and and
 
02:13:56.450 --> 02:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
controlled although I'd argue again that
 
02:13:58.490 --> 02:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
you already have these Powers you
 
02:14:00.050 --> 02:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
already have total control over the
 
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
behavior of these delegates should this
 
02:14:04.129 --> 02:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
bill not pass but this again I advocate
 
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill to increase
 
02:14:08.089 --> 02:14:08.099 align:start position:0%
confidence increase Trust
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
that thank you Senator other questions
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
see none thank you thank you Senator uh

Plaistow so the southeast border of the
 
02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:46.550 align:start position:0%
Plaistow so the southeast border of the
state

02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:14:49.850 --> 02:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of my testimony or
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
commentary here is uh because I'm the
 
02:14:57.050 --> 02:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the convention of States uh
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
resolution which you'll hear next week
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
and I've received a large number of
 
02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:03.530 align:start position:0%
and I've received a large number of
emails

02:15:03.530 --> 02:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
emails
 
02:15:07.370 --> 02:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
telling me that this is a illegitimate
 
02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:08.649 align:start position:0%
telling me that this is a illegitimate
process

02:15:08.649 --> 02:15:08.659 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
and that the the entire process by which
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
we uh ended up with the United States
 
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution was illegitimate these
 
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
delegates did not have the authority and
 
02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
power to
 
02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
end the Articles of Confederation
 
02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
and uh that I I want to go through a
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of History to dispel that
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
which is relevant to the entire concept
 
02:15:43.629 --> 02:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
of the state's nominating and tasking
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
delegates to support convention work
 
02:15:49.199 --> 02:15:50.870 align:start position:0%
delegates to support convention work
so

02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:53.450 --> 02:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
the Philadelphia Convention wasn't our
 
02:15:55.490 --> 02:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
first attempt to deal with the Articles
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
of Confederation it started in Annapolis
 
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
at a meeting titled the meeting of
 
02:16:05.569 --> 02:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to remedy defects of the
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:16:10.450 --> 02:16:10.460 align:start position:0%
that was in September of
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
1786 a year before the Philadelphia
 
02:16:16.930 --> 02:16:16.940 align:start position:0%
Convention and why did they meet because
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
it was recognized that the states had
 
02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
set up multiple barriers for uh
 
02:16:26.689 --> 02:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
restricting trade all kinds of tariffs
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
between the different states
 
02:16:31.490 --> 02:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:16:34.730 --> 02:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
that convention was called with respect
 
02:16:40.009 --> 02:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
to dealing with that unique Soul tasking
 
02:16:43.009 --> 02:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
now New Jersey New York Pennsylvania and
 
02:16:45.770 --> 02:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
Delaware and Virginia showed up
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
and North Carolina didn't make it it was
 
02:16:52.509 --> 02:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
a four-day convention and they were late
 
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
so they weren't part of the convention
 
02:16:57.730 --> 02:16:57.740 align:start position:0%
the other states
 
02:17:00.349 --> 02:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
I apologize the representative they have
 
02:17:02.929 --> 02:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
a point of order for the chair
 
02:17:02.939 --> 02:17:04.129 align:start position:0%
a point of order for the chair
please

02:17:04.129 --> 02:17:04.139 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the bill before us
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
is on limiting The Authority of New
 
02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire delegates to policy making
 
02:17:11.219 --> 02:17:12.589 align:start position:0%
Hampshire delegates to policy making
conventions

02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
conventions
 
02:17:14.509 --> 02:17:14.519 align:start position:0%
and I think a friend from the
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
legislature is talking about how the
 
02:17:18.650 --> 02:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
convention first started and people went
 
02:17:20.810 --> 02:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
to the convention and it's interesting
 
02:17:23.089 --> 02:17:23.099 align:start position:0%
and I and I expect to hear that when we
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
take up the Article 5 Bill next week but
 
02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
I think now we're just focused on this
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
bill before us which is limiting uh the
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
role and I again apologize the member
 
02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
for interrupting and I want to hear what
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
he has to say but I think it should be
 
02:17:41.690 --> 02:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
given when we take up that bill and not
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
while we discuss this bill on limiting
 
02:17:46.370 --> 02:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh the authority of members to any
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention that's my point
 
02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
about Mr chairman thank you
 
02:17:53.089 --> 02:17:53.099 align:start position:0%
representative sherliff uh represent
 
02:17:55.969 --> 02:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
Bernardo the the History part I find
 
02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
very good and helpful but uh
 
02:18:02.169 --> 02:18:02.179 align:start position:0%
please try to tie this into the specific
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
measure that is before us if you would
 
02:18:09.049 --> 02:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman I understand the uh the
 
02:18:11.929 --> 02:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
comment the reason for the the short
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
diversion in history was was to make
 
02:18:18.349 --> 02:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
clear that states did have the authority
 
02:18:20.290 --> 02:18:20.300 align:start position:0%
to appoint
 
02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
delegates to various conventions and
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
they followed that tasking so the
 
02:18:29.209 --> 02:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
Annapolis folks followed the tasking and
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of their discussion they they
 
02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
said we need a broader convention and
 
02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
the article sent out a unanimous report
 
02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
saying we need a broader convention to
 
02:18:45.290 --> 02:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
discuss the issues of government
 
02:18:50.089 --> 02:18:50.099 align:start position:0%
for for these 13 colonies so that was
 
02:18:53.389 --> 02:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
followed the tasking was followed and
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
that is that is the point I mean the the
 
02:19:02.209 --> 02:19:02.219 align:start position:0%
the the concern for this uh Bill and and
 
02:19:06.169 --> 02:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
I think uh Senator Rubens made the point
 
02:19:10.730 --> 02:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
was we need to establish trust in this
 
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
process and and we as he already
 
02:19:17.629 --> 02:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
indicated we already have that Authority
 
02:19:21.889 --> 02:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
as a legislature to to address
 
02:19:26.209 --> 02:19:26.219 align:start position:0%
a tasking for a convention or other
 
02:19:30.650 --> 02:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
Interstate uh compact type issues but
 
02:19:34.669 --> 02:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
let in order to ensure that we have
 
02:19:38.209 --> 02:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
cemented that trust we use the this this
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
bill as the belt and suspenders as he
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
said to ensure that we
 
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
that that the the citizens of New
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will agree that yes the
 
02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
legislature has the authority the
 
02:19:54.290 --> 02:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
legislature has the ability to do the
 
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
tasking and the legislature has the
 
02:19:58.610 --> 02:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
ability to hold those delegates
 
02:19:58.620 --> 02:19:59.810 align:start position:0%
ability to hold those delegates
accountable

02:19:59.810 --> 02:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of this bill and
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose and the reason for
 
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
going through the history is to say we
 
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:20:20.330 --> 02:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:21.650 --> 02:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
saying that I thank you for your
 
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
testimony uh Senator rubin's earlier
 
02:20:27.370 --> 02:20:27.380 align:start position:0%
reference someone from Wolf Pack
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
wolf-p-a-c I believe that might be uh
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
Samuel Filman who is here uh asked for
 
02:20:36.410 --> 02:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
four minutes and uh
 
02:20:38.690 --> 02:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
Mr Phil you have four minutes
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
that you asked for
 
02:20:42.050 --> 02:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
and maybe more
 
02:20:49.929 --> 02:20:49.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
my name is Samuel fieldman I'm National
 
02:20:54.830 --> 02:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
Council for Wolf Pack I've been studying
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
the issue of these kinds of conventions
 
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
since uh 2010 uh when my kids were not
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
quite born yet uh they just turned 11.
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
um and you know these issues are near
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
and dear to my heart
 
02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
um I want to specifically talk about in
 
02:21:14.110 --> 02:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
the bill before us the moment uh
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
2c3 section 2 uh representative Porcelli
 
02:21:22.250 --> 02:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
talked about a Supreme Court case uh
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
cfollow and that's the case that this
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
language comes from but I want to give
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of the history of how
 
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
that language got to where it is today
 
02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
and in doing so that will also help you
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
better understand the different types of
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
conventions this bill deals with not
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
only Article 5 conventions but all types
 
02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
of Interstate conventions and it will
 
02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
also help you understand the why we know
 
02:21:46.849 --> 02:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
that this kind of limiting procedure is
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
possible first I'm very honored to be
 
02:21:51.530 --> 02:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
telling the story before representative
 
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
Kerry town crier of pascala New
 
02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because my Story begins right
 
02:21:59.570 --> 02:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
after representative Bernardi uh his
 
02:22:02.270 --> 02:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
story and it begins in that very Town
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
um the article the U.S Constitution
 
02:22:07.010 --> 02:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
under has three different types of
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
conventions it has two under Article 5
 
02:22:11.809 --> 02:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
for ratification and for proposing and
 
02:22:13.849 --> 02:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
it also has conventions under article 7.
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
the article 7 ratifying convention
 
02:22:18.889 --> 02:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
ratified the US Constitution itself and
 
02:22:20.450 --> 02:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
those were held in the various States
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
after uh the after the Constitution was
 
02:22:25.610 --> 02:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
proposed by the convention and by
 
02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:27.230 align:start position:0%
proposed by the convention and by
Congress

02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
02:22:28.849 --> 02:22:28.859 align:start position:0%
um in the town in the state of New
 
02:22:28.859 --> 02:22:29.650 align:start position:0%
um in the town in the state of New
Hampshire

02:22:29.650 --> 02:22:29.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
there were people who had very strong
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
feelings on both sides about the this
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
new Constitution and
 
02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
um they especially the overwhelming
 
02:22:40.010 --> 02:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
majority really opposed the new
 
02:22:41.929 --> 02:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
Constitution which is why some of the
 
02:22:43.490 --> 02:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
Federalists tried every trick in the
 
02:22:45.170 --> 02:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
book that they could think of holding
 
02:22:47.389 --> 02:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
the the convention in the middle of um
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
of a brutal New Hampshire winter in the
 
02:22:52.610 --> 02:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
Federalist controlled area where people
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
had to travel up to 200 miles to get
 
02:22:56.830 --> 02:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
there through the snow
 
02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
but it really mattered to people at the
 
02:23:01.010 --> 02:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
time and it's still these kinds of
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
things matter to us today uh which is
 
02:23:06.889 --> 02:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
why towns met elect delegates sent their
 
02:23:09.469 --> 02:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
delegates and towns also instructed
 
02:23:12.170 --> 02:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
their delegates specifically on the
 
02:23:14.030 --> 02:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
issue and many of the towns constructed
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
their delegates to vote no to vote
 
02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
against the U.S Constitution when they
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
got to the to the original convention in
 
02:23:23.090 --> 02:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they found that they
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough delegates to vote for
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
it but they also found that once the
 
02:23:28.670 --> 02:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
delegates were talking about the policy
 
02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
many of them found that they wish they
 
02:23:32.090 --> 02:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
had different instructions that they
 
02:23:34.250 --> 02:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
wished they could vote Yes for the
 
02:23:36.349 --> 02:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution but they couldn't because
 
02:23:38.330 --> 02:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
the instructions were they were Bound by
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
their instructions and the instructions
 
02:23:42.110 --> 02:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
were enforceable so they traveled back
 
02:23:43.610 --> 02:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire winter back to
 
02:23:45.770 --> 02:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
their towns and in the town of biscawan
 
02:23:47.389 --> 02:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
the the people there had instructed
 
02:23:52.250 --> 02:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
their delegates to vote no on uh their
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
delegate to vote no on the on the
 
02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:55.370 align:start position:0%
delegate to vote no on the on the
Constitution

02:23:55.370 --> 02:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
02:23:57.889 --> 02:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
um and he said you know if if you send
 
02:23:59.929 --> 02:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
me back I'm going to vote Yes
 
02:24:01.849 --> 02:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
um and they recognized in that town
 
02:24:05.090 --> 02:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
their inherent authority to replace that
 
02:24:07.250 --> 02:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
delegate with somebody else who would
 
02:24:08.990 --> 02:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
follow the right procedure they had
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
another candidate all picked out who was
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
ready and willing and they ultimately
 
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
decided that they would trust their
 
02:24:16.370 --> 02:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
delegate to vote his conscience and they
 
02:24:18.590 --> 02:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
would abide by that even if they were
 
02:24:20.510 --> 02:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
less certain about about that position
 
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
they trusted his knowledge and they
 
02:24:24.650 --> 02:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
decided to do that but they recognized
 
02:24:27.290 --> 02:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
that they had the authority to limit
 
02:24:30.770 --> 02:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
that delegate if uh if they so chose
 
02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
um fast forward to the conventions that
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh that Senator Rubens talked about uh
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
this time Article 5 conventions for
 
02:24:42.170 --> 02:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
ratification of the um of the uh
 
02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the 21st amendment
 
02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
um in that case as as you asked how to
 
02:24:49.730 --> 02:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
how did we figure out these things well
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
they were kind of scrambling because
 
02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
Congress called for an amendment and
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
called for it to be for the first time
 
02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
ever ratified by Article 5 ratification
 
02:25:03.230 --> 02:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
conventions and people didn't know how
 
02:25:05.150 --> 02:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
the Article 5 convention process worked
 
02:25:06.410 --> 02:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
in this case the ratification
 
02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
conventions as opposed to the as opposed
 
02:25:10.610 --> 02:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
to the amendment proposing convention
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of fear about that
 
02:25:14.809 --> 02:25:14.819 align:start position:0%
and States ended up scrambling to put
 
02:25:16.969 --> 02:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
together whatever the best delegate
 
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
limitation rules that they could
 
02:25:21.530 --> 02:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
um the book that representative that
 
02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Rubens talked about
 
02:25:25.969 --> 02:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
provides all of the laws passed by all
 
02:25:27.710 --> 02:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
the different states and nearly all of
 
02:25:29.630 --> 02:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
them had some sort of mechanism or other
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
of delegate limitations but only one of
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
them hit on the gold standard all of
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
them were effective none of the
 
02:25:37.250 --> 02:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
delegates ran away but one of them hit
 
02:25:39.290 --> 02:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
on the gold standard for for how to do
 
02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
it and it was this precise procedure
 
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
that was the state of Arizona where if a
 
02:25:45.050 --> 02:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
delegate ran away from their
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
instructions they would be removed their
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
vote would be invalidated and that and
 
02:25:51.410 --> 02:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
that they would then be replaced with an
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
alternate who would vote according to
 
02:25:55.010 --> 02:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
how they were instructed
 
02:25:57.050 --> 02:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
um uh that didn't end up needing to
 
02:25:57.060 --> 02:25:58.010 align:start position:0%
um uh that didn't end up needing to
happen

02:25:58.010 --> 02:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:26:00.170 --> 02:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
um but that exact language was later
 
02:26:02.290 --> 02:26:02.300 align:start position:0%
adopted by neighboring state New Mexico
 
02:26:05.570 --> 02:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh for uh for a different type of
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
Interstate convention in this case uh
 
02:26:11.690 --> 02:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
the um the Electoral College
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and the electricity Electoral College
 
02:26:16.429 --> 02:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
similar to delegates to a convention I
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
also are generally instructed uh to uh
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
by their various States and they have
 
02:26:23.809 --> 02:26:23.819 align:start position:0%
the same language there and in this case
 
02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh one of the delegates in New Mexico
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
did not want to vote for uh the person
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
who for I believe it was Hillary Clinton
 
02:26:32.690 --> 02:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh that their state had voted for and
 
02:26:34.849 --> 02:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
instead voted for Colin Powell that
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
delegates vote was invalidated it never
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
counted was not counted by Congress when
 
02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
they they met to count the votes and
 
02:26:43.790 --> 02:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
they were replaced by an alternate who
 
02:26:45.410 --> 02:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
voted as the state had instructed them
 
02:26:48.170 --> 02:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
to do and that was upheld unanimously by
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court
 
02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
um and you know this is in a very
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
divided Supreme Court but it was upheld
 
02:26:56.690 --> 02:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
unanimously just in 2020 and that's the
 
02:26:59.630 --> 02:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
language that is now in in this bill and
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's a language that's increasingly
 
02:27:04.010 --> 02:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
being adopted by more and more States as
 
02:27:05.150 --> 02:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're looking at this and being
 
02:27:07.130 --> 02:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
proposed in more and more States and
 
02:27:09.469 --> 02:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly important to have that
 
02:27:12.349 --> 02:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
kind of um that kind of bill pass ahead
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
of time well certainly states have
 
02:27:16.610 --> 02:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that when an article 5
 
02:27:19.370 --> 02:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
convention happens as happened in 1933
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
with the Article 5 ratifying conventions
 
02:27:24.410 --> 02:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
they are able to very quickly come up
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
with uh with a regulatory scheme pass a
 
02:27:29.330 --> 02:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
bill and handle it and it worked
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely wonderfully without without a
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
flaw then it's better to do it ahead of
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
time when you're not under that time
 
02:27:38.210 --> 02:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
pressure and that's why I'm in support
 
02:27:40.370 --> 02:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
take some some questions from the
 
02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:45.889 align:start position:0%
take some some questions from the
committee

02:27:45.889 --> 02:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for being here
 
02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
from wolf pack is Pac political action
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
committee not p-a-c-k correct oh yes
 
02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh we have three more cards we do
 
02:27:58.730 --> 02:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
have a card uh from a an individual
 
02:28:00.170 --> 02:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
posing the bill which I want to go to
 
02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
right now that is a representative uh
 
02:28:10.130 --> 02:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:13.010 --> 02:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
who asked for three minutes
 
02:28:14.929 --> 02:28:14.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Alvin Z I represent
 
02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
Merrimack 26 which goes from loud and
 
02:28:21.290 --> 02:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
over to Danbury if you want all eight
 
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
town named I'll give them to you I'm in
 
02:28:26.530 --> 02:28:26.540 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
when the enough states which is 34
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
request the U.S Congress for an article
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
5 convention
 
02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
the U.S archives is tasked with counting
 
02:28:39.770 --> 02:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there are those States
 
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
and there's correct number of states
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
um then the U.S Congress sets the
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
conditions of the convention and the
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
same Congress determines the
 
02:28:53.929 --> 02:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
qualifications of delegates and
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:00.910 --> 02:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention
 
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh is a federal function not a state
 
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
function as such this bill has no
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
control and therefore this bill provides
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
false confidence in New Hampshire's
 
02:29:16.969 --> 02:29:16.979 align:start position:0%
ability to control the delegates
 
02:29:20.990 --> 02:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
also in uh some of the written testimony
 
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's been provided online uh it was
 
02:29:28.030 --> 02:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
talked about it only takes 13 or more
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
states to reject any
 
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
changes but if a new con a new
 
02:29:37.969 --> 02:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
constitution is proposed the new
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
constitution may have different
 
02:29:41.530 --> 02:29:41.540 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
adopting it and therefore the 13 states
 
02:29:47.690 --> 02:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
may not be enough
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's why I'm opposed to this
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
because it gives a misleading
 
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh confidence in in our ability to do
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
anything about a runaway convention
 
02:30:01.610 --> 02:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll take questions if any are
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
C9 thank you representative
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
leave two more cards both in support of
 
02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm looking at uh William Jolly
 
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
William is in the back and he's coming
 
02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
to the front
 
02:30:19.020 --> 02:30:20.690 align:start position:0%
to the front
voice

02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
voice
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
from Groton New Hampshire popular
 
02:30:25.130 --> 02:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
population 700
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
unless somebody was born or died today
 
02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:28.429 align:start position:0%
unless somebody was born or died today
so

02:30:28.429 --> 02:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:28.439 --> 02:30:30.230 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:33.710 --> 02:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much uh my my 15 year
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
old daughter is trying to make me groovy
 
02:30:37.250 --> 02:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's working I and the
 
02:30:38.210 --> 02:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
reason I tell you that is I'm going to
 
02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
use my phone to read to you but I had to
 
02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
go next door and borrow some
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
reading glasses so I got I don't think
 
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm groovy uh
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
and I don't even know if that's a word
 
02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
anymore so uh ladies and gentlemen thank
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
you okay that's not working ladies and
 
02:30:55.969 --> 02:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thank you for an opportunity
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
for all of us to speak to this
 
02:30:58.920 --> 02:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
for all of us to speak to this
um

02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'm a soldier I was a soldier I'm
 
02:31:04.250 --> 02:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
retired I guess I'm still in the retired
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
reserve and uh
 
02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
I get a little worked up here thinking
 
02:31:10.490 --> 02:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
about the people who spoke earlier the
 
02:31:12.889 --> 02:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
heroes that got shot at blown up things
 
02:31:14.750 --> 02:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
like that came here to testify before
 
02:31:14.760 --> 02:31:16.370 align:start position:0%
like that came here to testify before
you

02:31:16.370 --> 02:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that was a a
 
02:31:21.290 --> 02:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
resonating message from them and it's
 
02:31:23.210 --> 02:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
the observation of the people and we are
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
a government of them by and for the
 
02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:25.910 align:start position:0%
a government of them by and for the
people

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
is that they don't feel they're being
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
represented by their Congress because
 
02:31:31.610 --> 02:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
the Congress abandoned their
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility and delegated it to the
 
02:31:34.319 --> 02:31:35.389 align:start position:0%
responsibility and delegated it to the
executive

02:31:35.389 --> 02:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
executive
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
also he was an act of cowardice because
 
02:31:39.950 --> 02:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
it is okay so when we're talking about
 
02:31:43.010 --> 02:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
this stuff it's the same thing what
 
02:31:44.570 --> 02:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
we're talking about when we speak to and
 
02:31:46.690 --> 02:31:46.700 align:start position:0%
I will get into it and I'm I'm not a
 
02:31:48.889 --> 02:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
constitutional scholar I'm a
 
02:31:50.450 --> 02:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
constitutional student I've been
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
interested for decades but my Master's
 
02:31:54.770 --> 02:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
in Business Administration it's not a
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
big deal so
 
02:32:00.290 --> 02:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
when I look at what
 
02:32:03.230 --> 02:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
we're facing and the reason for the fear
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
that others have mentioned is we don't
 
02:32:08.090 --> 02:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
trust the institutions that we keep
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
saying are going to do the right thing
 
02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
by us in the event of um
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll speak to the Constitutional
 
02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
Convention because I was unaware that
 
02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
this bill uh reaches out to other types
 
02:32:21.889 --> 02:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
of conventions
 
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
we don't trust the institutions as
 
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
they're operating today
 
02:32:28.429 --> 02:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at histories prior to
 
02:32:30.110 --> 02:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
World War II which was the last time we
 
02:32:32.090 --> 02:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
actually declared war so I see a thread
 
02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
here and I think it's important that we
 
02:32:36.050 --> 02:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
consider that because
 
02:32:38.510 --> 02:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
this Constitutional Convention that we
 
02:32:40.370 --> 02:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
have should serve as a check for the bad
 
02:32:43.849 --> 02:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
behavior of our elected people and our
 
02:32:46.490 --> 02:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
appointed people subordinate to them so
 
02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'll get into the the verbiage of my
 
02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
ramblings here I did KISS the Blarney
 
02:32:52.849 --> 02:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
Stone but I've managed to tighten up my
 
02:32:54.410 --> 02:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
speech quite a bit so I won't be too
 
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
long I promise uh so I'll just read even
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
though some of it's repetitive thank you
 
02:32:59.389 --> 02:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen for the opportunity
 
02:33:00.830 --> 02:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
to speak in this my name is William
 
02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:02.150 align:start position:0%
to speak in this my name is William
Jolly

02:33:02.150 --> 02:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
Jolly
 
02:33:04.730 --> 02:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm a resident of Groton I moved up
 
02:33:07.730 --> 02:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
from Boston uh my house looked at the
 
02:33:09.710 --> 02:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
rail I would have looked at the rail of
 
02:33:11.929 --> 02:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
the uh Bunker Hill battle which is
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
actually on breeds Hill so I moved up
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
here thinking things are going to be
 
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
pretty conservative and I hope we can
 
02:33:18.770 --> 02:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
keep things in check and have truly
 
02:33:20.570 --> 02:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
purple rather than one color extreme or
 
02:33:23.630 --> 02:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
another but I in full disclosure I'm
 
02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
here as an individual and I am a uh uh
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
we have a different title for it in
 
02:33:30.410 --> 02:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
Grafton County I'm a delegate to the
 
02:33:32.809 --> 02:33:32.819 align:start position:0%
state Republican committee so but I'm
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
here as an individual I'm not
 
02:33:35.389 --> 02:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
representing them in my statements right
 
02:33:35.399 --> 02:33:36.230 align:start position:0%
representing them in my statements right
now

02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:38.170 align:start position:0%
now
professionally

02:33:38.170 --> 02:33:38.180 align:start position:0%
professionally
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
professionally I'm an insurance broker
 
02:33:43.130 --> 02:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
in an earlier life I mentioned I was a
 
02:33:45.650 --> 02:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
soldier in one of my last jobs over 32
 
02:33:47.690 --> 02:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
years as a soldier and prior to that in
 
02:33:50.510 --> 02:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
Navy Seabee was as a tactical
 
02:33:52.849 --> 02:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
information operations planner and
 
02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
instructor at Norwich University and so
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
I worked on staffs uh doing stuff that
 
02:33:59.870 --> 02:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
we won't get into but it was it was
 
02:34:02.690 --> 02:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy stuff one of my jobs is one
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
that you folks have right now and that
 
02:34:06.849 --> 02:34:06.859 align:start position:0%
was too you may have heard of this sir
 
02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
that was to analyze assess and find ways
 
02:34:12.410 --> 02:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
to mitigate second and third order
 
02:34:14.809 --> 02:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
effects risks
 
02:34:19.070 --> 02:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
and introduce them this bill does that
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
I'm one of the people that does not have
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
confidence in in the security of an
 
02:34:27.349 --> 02:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention right now
 
02:34:31.010 --> 02:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
um so I'm obviously I'm here to uh say
 
02:34:32.870 --> 02:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
it should uh should be ought to pass but
 
02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:34.010 align:start position:0%
it should uh should be ought to pass but
by

02:34:34.010 --> 02:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:34:36.170 --> 02:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
all appearances there are three reasons
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh why I'm in favor of this in Article 5
 
02:34:41.330 --> 02:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
conventional States should be relied
 
02:34:42.889 --> 02:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
upon as a check on the federal
 
02:34:44.929 --> 02:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
government but the founders left us with
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
very little uh to work with as to what
 
02:34:48.770 --> 02:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
this thing looks like when it's done how
 
02:34:50.690 --> 02:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
is it structured there is some language
 
02:34:52.010 --> 02:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
out there
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
none of it is law it's all experience
 
02:34:59.389 --> 02:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
and and in some cases conjecture uh
 
02:35:01.730 --> 02:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
there's currently no solid check on
 
02:35:03.650 --> 02:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
potential Rogues to an article 5
 
02:35:03.660 --> 02:35:05.090 align:start position:0%
potential Rogues to an article 5
convention

02:35:05.090 --> 02:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
convention
 
02:35:07.370 --> 02:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh by at least not by New Hampshire and
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's not sufficient checks to Rogues
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
across the several States right so it's
 
02:35:15.170 --> 02:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
if we have a number of people that band
 
02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
together and we in 15 other states have
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
our check in place is that going to be
 
02:35:23.389 --> 02:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
adequate so I'm not I'm not saying that
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
this is a Panacea for for what we face
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
but I think it's an important Cog in the
 
02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:29.450 align:start position:0%
but I think it's an important Cog in the
wheel

02:35:29.450 --> 02:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
wheel
 
02:35:31.250 --> 02:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
um there is a potential for a rogue
 
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
delegate or delegation from the majority
 
02:35:34.670 --> 02:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
of States including New Hampshire right
 
02:35:36.830 --> 02:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
now to behave in a manner inconsistent
 
02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
with the intent of individual State
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
legislatures there's currently no solid
 
02:35:43.610 --> 02:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
check on potential Rogues lastly a
 
02:35:45.410 --> 02:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
majority of states with legislation like
 
02:35:47.510 --> 02:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
this proposal are better yet adoption by
 
02:35:49.610 --> 02:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
all the states with something similar to
 
02:35:52.010 --> 02:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
our proposed piece will provide a
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
measure although incomplete of
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
mitigation of the risk of a runaway
 
02:35:57.309 --> 02:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
Convention of states
 
02:35:59.809 --> 02:35:59.819 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned I'm not a constitutional
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
scholar but I do I do have a lot of
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
passion for it and like a lot of people
 
02:36:05.090 --> 02:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
behind me and probably a lot of you I
 
02:36:07.670 --> 02:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
pay attention to it and I study it
 
02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:09.710 align:start position:0%
pay attention to it and I study it
um

02:36:09.710 --> 02:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:12.170 --> 02:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
one of the people that we should be
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
looking to is someone who's is
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
considered a constitutional scholar and
 
02:36:18.410 --> 02:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's Justice Berger U.S Supreme Court
 
02:36:20.690 --> 02:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
Justice Berger served from the late
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
1960s to the late 1980s he was a
 
02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
Republican appointee and he wrote
 
02:36:28.490 --> 02:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
there is no effective way to limit or
 
02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
muzzle the actions of a constitutional
 
02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:31.730 align:start position:0%
muzzle the actions of a constitutional
convention

02:36:31.730 --> 02:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
convention
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
the convention could make its own rules
 
02:36:36.290 --> 02:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
and set its own agenda Congress might
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
try to limit the convention to one
 
02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment or to one issue which is
 
02:36:41.389 --> 02:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
probably a good thing but there is no
 
02:36:43.370 --> 02:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
way to assure that the convention would
 
02:36:43.380 --> 02:36:44.270 align:start position:0%
way to assure that the convention would
obey

02:36:44.270 --> 02:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
obey
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
after a convention is convened it is too
 
02:36:49.130 --> 02:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
late to stay uh to stop the convention
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
if we don't like its agenda so again I I
 
02:36:55.130 --> 02:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
don't there are people that uh disagree
 
02:36:56.570 --> 02:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
with what this Justice said and they're
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
going to speak later but he was a
 
02:37:00.469 --> 02:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Justice he couldn't have
 
02:37:02.330 --> 02:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
been a knucklehead part of English and
 
02:37:06.530 --> 02:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
he uh and he probably had some some
 
02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
references that he could cite in order
 
02:37:13.309 --> 02:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
and I'll wrap this up pretty quickly the
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
potential for a Convention of States
 
02:37:19.610 --> 02:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
this is my words the potential for a
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
Convention of States should be relied
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
upon as a check for the three branches
 
02:37:24.349 --> 02:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
of federal government
 
02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
without an ability for states to control
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
their delegates we are at risk for
 
02:37:30.530 --> 02:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
unanticipated outcomes
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
this absence of guidance and experience
 
02:37:34.730 --> 02:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
juxtaposed with the abundance of
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Behavior exhibited by
 
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
people around the nation empowered at
 
02:37:40.510 --> 02:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
the federal and state levels today
 
02:37:43.010 --> 02:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
events is a need for good people to
 
02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
create protections that's you guys to
 
02:37:47.330 --> 02:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
create protections for the constituents
 
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity for you adoption
 
02:37:53.450 --> 02:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
of HB 269 is a statute will be a step in
 
02:37:54.830 --> 02:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
the right direction for New Hampshire to
 
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
protect us from having to debate with
 
02:37:58.730 --> 02:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
uncertain outcomes proposed bad
 
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
amendments and to serve as a good model
 
02:38:03.050 --> 02:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
for other states in particular within
 
02:38:04.670 --> 02:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
the body and this this is critical I
 
02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
think that we have this thing called
 
02:38:07.730 --> 02:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
center of gravity what that is is
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
basically the thing that's going to make
 
02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
this really really a valuable tool the
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
center of gravity to this would be a C3
 
02:38:19.370 --> 02:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
subsection two and where they talk about
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
nullification because there isn't a lot
 
02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
of language about that out there and if
 
02:38:27.170 --> 02:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
we can nullify prior to the bad behavior
 
02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
we have a better argument when it would
 
02:38:32.750 --> 02:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
probably go to the U.S Supreme Court so
 
02:38:34.849 --> 02:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
that's not based on my legal experience
 
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't have any but based on my
 
02:38:38.450 --> 02:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
observations so that's all I have
 
02:38:39.950 --> 02:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
pending your questions thank you for
 
02:38:41.630 --> 02:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
your time
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming down from Groton
 
02:38:47.809 --> 02:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:50.150 --> 02:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you seeing none your
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
daughter can review the video as to uh
 
02:38:54.290 --> 02:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
your grooving this so she's not allowed
 
02:38:55.070 --> 02:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
to see this because it'll be
 
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
never-ending judgment thank you
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
here uh uh is from um Ken Quinn Ken is
 
02:39:06.490 --> 02:39:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:14.170 align:start position:0%
 
submitted

02:39:14.170 --> 02:39:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:16.610 --> 02:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
that online
 
02:39:18.770 --> 02:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Kenny saw that and it's
 
02:39:21.050 --> 02:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
much appreciated great information and
 
02:39:23.450 --> 02:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
we all have that in our inboxes
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wants to speak
 
02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
to this measure
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh Senator uh Rubens uh you can have you
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:38.590 align:start position:0%
 
yep

02:39:38.590 --> 02:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
yep

welcome thank you Mr chair members of
 
03:38:08.809 --> 03:38:08.819 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Carol McGuire

Merrimack District 27 which is
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
Allenstown Dunbarton Epsom and Hooksett
 
03:38:19.010 --> 03:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 330 is a request of the
 
03:38:21.170 --> 03:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Veterans Affairs
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.490 --> 03:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
incentive program to gel car
 
03:38:34.330 --> 03:38:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
only case where they were required to to
 
03:38:40.090 --> 03:38:40.100 align:start position:0%
go through the formal rulemaking process
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
and gel Carr couldn't figure out why
 
03:38:46.370 --> 03:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
they should be required to do so
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
so this bill started as
 
03:38:53.710 --> 03:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
simply deleting the
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
541a reference on page one line 28 and
 
03:38:58.920 --> 03:39:00.050 align:start position:0%
541a reference on page one line 28 and
said

03:39:00.050 --> 03:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:39:01.729 --> 03:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
you have rules
 
03:39:04.490 --> 03:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
we'll um will follow
 
03:39:06.170 --> 03:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
that's that's good enough they don't
 
03:39:09.170 --> 03:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
need to go through legislative approval
 
03:39:13.250 --> 03:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
I also
 
03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
at their request added that the any
 
03:39:22.490 --> 03:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
fines that they collect would go into
 
03:39:25.010 --> 03:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
their enlistment incentive fund
 
03:39:25.020 --> 03:39:26.330 align:start position:0%
their enlistment incentive fund
but

03:39:26.330 --> 03:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:39:26.340 --> 03:39:27.229 align:start position:0%
but
um

03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
didn't seem like a big deal and
 
03:39:33.650 --> 03:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
increased the uh incentive payment from
 
03:39:36.410 --> 03:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
500 to a thousand dollars because of
 
03:39:36.420 --> 03:39:38.269 align:start position:0%
500 to a thousand dollars because of
inflation

03:39:38.269 --> 03:39:38.279 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
and I will try to
 
03:39:43.969 --> 03:39:43.979 align:start position:0%

03:41:40.190 --> 03:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
this bill does three things right it
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
increases a current statute to increase
 
03:41:45.050 --> 03:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
our enlistment incentive program from

statute to apply to this in the last
 
03:42:04.010 --> 03:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
legislative session and the third thing
 
03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
was uh Mr Perry will specifically answer
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
your question ma'am in regards to the
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
the fines conceptually when a soldier uh
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
gets an Article 15 he gets in trouble
 
03:42:17.389 --> 03:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
during a drill status
 
03:42:19.010 --> 03:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
um he pays a fine for whatever that
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
infraction may occur we used to apply
 
03:42:23.690 --> 03:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
those funds to our scholarship found
 
03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
account we no longer have a scholarship
 
03:42:27.710 --> 03:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
account because of tuition waiver that
 
03:42:29.389 --> 03:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
we offer our service members at the
 
03:42:31.790 --> 03:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire
 
03:42:34.370 --> 03:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
so it now goes into the general funds
 
03:42:36.349 --> 03:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
um it's a sort of a nominal fee I'd say
 
03:42:39.290 --> 03:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
a thousand to five thousand dollars so
 
03:42:40.370 --> 03:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
instead of it just going to the general
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
fund it would come back into this
 
03:42:42.239 --> 03:42:43.309 align:start position:0%
fund it would come back into this
account

03:42:43.309 --> 03:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
account
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
the primary thing I'd like to talk about
 
03:42:46.729 --> 03:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
is mostly about the why it's going from
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
500 to a thousand dollars
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
um you have my written testimony then
 
03:42:52.429 --> 03:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
behind that is some updated information
 
03:42:55.010 --> 03:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
about the current recruiting market and
 
03:42:56.150 --> 03:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
as I alluded to in an earlier
 
03:42:57.410 --> 03:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
conversation with you all about a week
 
03:42:57.420 --> 03:42:58.309 align:start position:0%
conversation with you all about a week
ago

03:42:58.309 --> 03:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
um there is no line on our door we're
 
03:43:02.210 --> 03:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
we're a word of mouth business or a
 
03:43:03.769 --> 03:43:03.779 align:start position:0%
family business eighty percent of new
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
recruits come from a military family but
 
03:43:08.150 --> 03:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
we're also referral business so by
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
referrals is our best recruiting
 
03:43:14.510 --> 03:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
advertisement is Word of Mouth
 
03:43:16.670 --> 03:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
Six States in the country have gone to
 
03:43:19.190 --> 03:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
this enlistment incentive program the
 
03:43:21.290 --> 03:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
closest state is Vermont
 
03:43:23.090 --> 03:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
um when we had this legislation passed
 
03:43:26.090 --> 03:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
last cycle it was for 500 it's not
 
03:43:27.530 --> 03:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
having an impact as much as we would
 
03:43:29.210 --> 03:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
have hoped
 
03:43:31.729 --> 03:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
um so we think we need to elevate it to
 
03:43:33.349 --> 03:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars to be more comparable
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
to have have a bigger impact to getting
 
03:43:38.809 --> 03:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
referrals sent to us right now we have
 
03:43:40.729 --> 03:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
about it when this came in effect after
 
03:43:43.130 --> 03:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking process we've been uh
 
03:43:46.429 --> 03:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
doing this for about two months now
 
03:43:48.530 --> 03:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
um a soldier Airman has not shipped yet
 
03:43:50.630 --> 03:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
so we have not actually given out any
 
03:43:53.690 --> 03:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
money as an incentive during this
 
03:43:55.790 --> 03:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
incentive program but we anticipate that
 
03:43:58.250 --> 03:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
happening in the next month or two
 
03:44:00.170 --> 03:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much subject to the
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
questions that's all I have
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you sir uh questions for Major
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative minion
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
03:44:13.680 --> 03:44:14.690 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
question

03:44:14.690 --> 03:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so if you increase the incentive
 
03:44:18.889 --> 03:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
program is it possible that the money
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
isn't an issue and people don't want to
 
03:44:22.969 --> 03:44:22.979 align:start position:0%
join the National Guard and then deploy
 
03:44:24.830 --> 03:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
to war zones let's say
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
03:44:30.769 --> 03:44:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Finney thank you Mr chair
 
03:44:38.210 --> 03:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh sir I just have one one question
 
03:44:41.030 --> 03:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
about uh one specific part in line 15
 
03:44:42.650 --> 03:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
here it says that
 
03:44:44.050 --> 03:44:44.060 align:start position:0%
Uh current
 
03:44:46.429 --> 03:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
uh members of the National Guard in the
 
03:44:49.010 --> 03:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
pay grades of E1 to O3
 
03:44:50.690 --> 03:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
um I just want to know what the
 
03:44:53.330 --> 03:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
rationale is uh between allowing
 
03:44:56.929 --> 03:44:56.939 align:start position:0%
officers who uh would already make us a
 
03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money or realistic
 
03:45:00.650 --> 03:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
person would be allowed to take
 
03:45:02.870 --> 03:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of an incentive program
 
03:45:05.570 --> 03:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh so so we try to keep it to the junior
 
03:45:07.309 --> 03:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
officers like lieutenants and an O3 is
 
03:45:08.809 --> 03:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
obviously a captain
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
um captains uh don't make that much as
 
03:45:14.750 --> 03:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
much money as a senior officer and the
 
03:45:16.849 --> 03:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
rationale was we still need officers to
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
join our formation
 
03:45:20.269 --> 03:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
so we still need if the officer goes to
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
college and he's a second Lieutenant
 
03:45:24.889 --> 03:45:24.899 align:start position:0%
he's in ROTC and he's a simultaneous
 
03:45:28.190 --> 03:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
Member Program at SMP Cadet uh that's a
 
03:45:29.450 --> 03:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
referral to us
 
03:45:32.510 --> 03:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
so that you know that's lieutenants you
 
03:45:34.010 --> 03:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
know we need that too
 
03:45:35.929 --> 03:45:35.939 align:start position:0%
the follow-ups
 
03:45:37.490 --> 03:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:45:39.769 --> 03:45:39.779 align:start position:0%
um isn't it true sir that um commission
 
03:45:41.630 --> 03:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
offices whether they're senior or not
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
still taking more more benefits of their
 
03:45:46.969 --> 03:45:46.979 align:start position:0%
commission over a little person
 
03:45:50.450 --> 03:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh probably financially but the benefits
 
03:45:52.130 --> 03:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
of the benefits for any service member
 
03:45:53.990 --> 03:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
whether Army Air generally speaking
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
whether it's like you know for example
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
Congress passed 12 weeks of Parental
 
03:45:58.849 --> 03:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
leave they don't discriminate between
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
illicitor officer
 
03:46:02.330 --> 03:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
thanks sir
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:46:07.729 --> 03:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kerry
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
just the mundane one um can you spell
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
oh I just yeah went off the end of the
 
03:46:21.479 --> 03:46:22.510 align:start position:0%
oh I just yeah went off the end of the
card

03:46:22.510 --> 03:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
card
 
03:46:26.269 --> 03:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
m-i-k yep o l a i
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
t i e s
 
03:46:31.190 --> 03:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
I'll get it eventually okay
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
we stress attention to detail here in
 
03:46:35.630 --> 03:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
state federal records
 
03:46:38.269 --> 03:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:46:41.210 --> 03:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
thank you so much sir thank you
 
03:46:43.729 --> 03:46:43.739 align:start position:0%
uh Lauren Perry is still in the house
 
03:46:47.510 --> 03:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
for the record uh Warren Perry Deputy
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
General New Hampshire Department of
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services I
 
03:46:53.809 --> 03:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
want to talk specifically about the
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
rulemaking piece of this so in in the
 
03:46:58.910 --> 03:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
written testimony uh that that you see
 
03:47:02.389 --> 03:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
you'll note that RSA 110b
 
03:47:04.969 --> 03:47:04.979 align:start position:0%
um eight exempts the department from all
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and we love that exemption by
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
the way we think it's the best thing in
 
03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
the whole world but there are two parts
 
03:47:13.190 --> 03:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
of our statute that had subsequent uh to
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
to 110 B8 being passed had rule making
 
03:47:17.570 --> 03:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
requirements right one is for the
 
03:47:18.889 --> 03:47:18.899 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver program or the
 
03:47:20.990 --> 03:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education program and
 
03:47:22.610 --> 03:47:22.620 align:start position:0%
those rules are contingent on those
 
03:47:24.290 --> 03:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
rules administrative rules at the edge
 
03:47:26.330 --> 03:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
in general deems necessary and luckily
 
03:47:28.190 --> 03:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
he doesn't deem any necessary now but we
 
03:47:30.650 --> 03:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
still want to clean up the statute
 
03:47:33.050 --> 03:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
when the appropriation came for this
 
03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
particular program the legislation this
 
03:47:37.010 --> 03:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
legislature the general court was
 
03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
probably not aware of the general
 
03:47:39.769 --> 03:47:39.779 align:start position:0%
exemption and in their standard
 
03:47:41.929 --> 03:47:41.939 align:start position:0%
legislative language added a requirement
 
03:47:43.969 --> 03:47:43.979 align:start position:0%
for us to to write administrative rules
 
03:47:45.889 --> 03:47:45.899 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you that process is very
 
03:47:45.899 --> 03:47:47.030 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you that process is very
arduous

03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
arduous
 
03:47:50.330 --> 03:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
and 541 says that rules only apply when
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
they apply to the General Public
 
03:47:55.010 --> 03:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
right so you know if it's going to have
 
03:47:56.450 --> 03:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
something binding on the general public
 
03:47:58.429 --> 03:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
and the populations that we deal with
 
03:48:00.290 --> 03:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily the general public
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
they are current and former members of
 
03:48:04.130 --> 03:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard and not
 
03:48:06.290 --> 03:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
binding on the general public and that's
 
03:48:08.150 --> 03:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
generally the rationale that when we
 
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
talk to the folks at uh at legislative
 
03:48:13.190 --> 03:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
services and we talked to the folks at
 
03:48:15.650 --> 03:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
gel car they said let's clean this up so
 
03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's really the rationale by which we
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
want to eliminate this rulemaking
 
03:48:21.469 --> 03:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
requirement we it's not that we don't
 
03:48:23.090 --> 03:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
want legislative oversight because we
 
03:48:26.690 --> 03:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
love it but in this particular case the
 
03:48:29.870 --> 03:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
rulemaking requirements are are you know
 
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
to get that done it's it's an arduous
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
process and it takes a lot of time it
 
03:48:34.849 --> 03:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
took about
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
16 months just to get through to get the
 
03:48:39.650 --> 03:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
rules that we have now to be able to do
 
03:48:40.969 --> 03:48:40.979 align:start position:0%
this so what we'd like to do is just do
 
03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
away with that rulemaking requirement we
 
03:48:44.210 --> 03:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
don't think it's too much of an ask and
 
03:48:46.010 --> 03:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
we'd ask you from that perspective to be
 
03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
able to to eliminate this the second
 
03:48:49.790 --> 03:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
thing I'd like to say is there's part of
 
03:48:52.490 --> 03:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
this statute or part of this bill
 
03:48:54.790 --> 03:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
that makes this uh appropriation
 
03:48:58.309 --> 03:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
continuous and non-lapsing and that just
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
eliminates our need to go back every
 
03:49:02.510 --> 03:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
time we pay one of these bills if we
 
03:49:03.710 --> 03:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
want to be paid one of these incentives
 
03:49:05.330 --> 03:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
not to have to go back to the to the
 
03:49:07.190 --> 03:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
executive Council to pay it so if we
 
03:49:08.809 --> 03:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
have that language in here that would
 
03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
just reduce our administrative burden as
 
03:49:12.590 --> 03:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
we do this again not that we don't want
 
03:49:14.630 --> 03:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
the oversight we absolutely do we know
 
03:49:16.370 --> 03:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
that you know the potential for fraud
 
03:49:18.050 --> 03:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
exists in these kinds of programs we
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
want to have great oversight but every
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
time we pay one of these benefits it
 
03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
will delay the payment and and everybody
 
03:49:26.090 --> 03:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
knows that reward is best when it's
 
03:49:28.250 --> 03:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
immediately given so we'd like to not
 
03:49:29.809 --> 03:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
have to do that in order to make those
 
03:49:31.070 --> 03:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
payments and those are the two things
 
03:49:33.229 --> 03:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to talk about or I wanted
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
to talk about here so subject to your
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
questions and I'll be happy to address
 
03:49:40.250 --> 03:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
your fine question uh but subject to
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
your questions I'll uh and I will that
 
03:49:44.090 --> 03:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony I'll be happy to
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Perry
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
um back to the Fine question that uh
 
03:49:52.190 --> 03:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd brought up
 
03:49:54.290 --> 03:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins
 
03:49:56.389 --> 03:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
also expressed some interest and I I
 
03:49:58.490 --> 03:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
know from my experience with Article 15
 
03:50:01.010 --> 03:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
and JP what we call office hours it
 
03:50:03.530 --> 03:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
would be fines so I hadn't thought of
 
03:50:07.490 --> 03:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
this until just now but uh I I'm some of
 
03:50:09.290 --> 03:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
us may be curious as to if you could
 
03:50:12.290 --> 03:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
quantify the uh the amount of potential
 
03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
fine uh funds uh is it miniscule or
 
03:50:18.410 --> 03:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
significant if you know it's less than
 
03:50:20.269 --> 03:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars a year
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
so I would say minuscule and I would I
 
03:50:24.290 --> 03:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact number off my top
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
of my head I will be sure to email that
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to the financial manager
 
03:50:29.870 --> 03:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
but it's not much probably I think on
 
03:50:33.410 --> 03:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
average somewhere between 12 and 1800 a
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
I wanna and that's not all to one person
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
by the way I mean that's that's spread
 
03:50:43.729 --> 03:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
over anybody who gets in trouble
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
because that kind of touch on your
 
03:50:45.300 --> 03:50:47.030 align:start position:0%
because that kind of touch on your
question

03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat um I guess I'm looking at this
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
I've I've been working in non-profit
 
03:50:53.870 --> 03:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
Finance for 14 years
 
03:50:55.969 --> 03:50:55.979 align:start position:0%
um so I'm very attuned to where things
 
03:50:59.450 --> 03:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
are allocated and budgets um so I guess
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
my concern here would be to prevent any
 
03:51:07.269 --> 03:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
real or perceived impropriety as far as
 
03:51:09.710 --> 03:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
imposition of fines
 
03:51:12.590 --> 03:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
on to people and this being a need-based
 
03:51:15.410 --> 03:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
service because I know that as far as
 
03:51:17.929 --> 03:51:17.939 align:start position:0%
recruitment goes our recruitment we need
 
03:51:20.030 --> 03:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
to have that going on so you're kind of
 
03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
saying like the town needs to make up
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
their their their shortfall so they
 
03:51:26.030 --> 03:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
write more speeding tickets is that kind
 
03:51:28.250 --> 03:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
of where you're going bent that so
 
03:51:30.530 --> 03:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
assumption so so we don't you know
 
03:51:33.050 --> 03:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
levying non-judicial punishment or
 
03:51:34.910 --> 03:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
article 15s or general course Marshall
 
03:51:38.389 --> 03:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
is a legal process subject to legal and
 
03:51:41.929 --> 03:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
due process rules outlined in RSA 110b
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
starting at 110 B 39 and those processes
 
03:51:47.210 --> 03:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
mirror the uniform code of military
 
03:51:50.269 --> 03:51:50.279 align:start position:0%
justice so without a lawyer without due
 
03:51:52.729 --> 03:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
process without an appellate process we
 
03:51:54.830 --> 03:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
don't do this so the generally focused
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
at misconduct and minor misconduct so
 
03:51:59.809 --> 03:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
non-criminal misconduct is generally
 
03:52:01.729 --> 03:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
where these these fines are levied and
 
03:52:04.429 --> 03:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
we're not going out to punish people so
 
03:52:06.170 --> 03:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
that we can fill this fund I can assure
 
03:52:07.309 --> 03:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
you that that's not going to happen
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
we're more concerned that we get the 50
 
03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
000 dollars appropriation that we put in
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
our budget to get this funded
 
03:52:16.969 --> 03:52:16.979 align:start position:0%
I hope I hope I've answered your
 
03:52:16.979 --> 03:52:18.050 align:start position:0%
I hope I hope I've answered your
question

03:52:18.050 --> 03:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:52:20.809 --> 03:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:22.849 --> 03:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
um so with that
 
03:52:25.790 --> 03:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
um that's great to hear um but the other
 
03:52:28.610 --> 03:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
question is are there any other
 
03:52:30.769 --> 03:52:30.779 align:start position:0%
budgetary items that could potentially
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
use these funds and then reallocate
 
03:52:36.349 --> 03:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
those funds from another portion that
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
would be less need based I'm not sure I
 
03:52:43.729 --> 03:52:43.739 align:start position:0%
understand your question so like if um
 
03:52:45.650 --> 03:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
so these fines
 
03:52:49.010 --> 03:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
um again to avoid any perceived
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
impropriety of use of these um is there
 
03:52:56.090 --> 03:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the budget where
 
03:52:58.250 --> 03:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
um they could go that is a more static
 
03:53:01.370 --> 03:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
cost that does not vary from year to
 
03:53:01.380 --> 03:53:03.530 align:start position:0%
cost that does not vary from year to
year

03:53:03.530 --> 03:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:06.650 --> 03:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
so they could right it's always there's
 
03:53:09.050 --> 03:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
always an option to go do that I think
 
03:53:12.050 --> 03:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
that it's on so from from my perspective
 
03:53:13.729 --> 03:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
again I want to reassure you that it's
 
03:53:15.050 --> 03:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
unlikely that we're going to increase
 
03:53:16.729 --> 03:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
the amount of punishment that we give to
 
03:53:18.830 --> 03:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
do this I think this is the cleanest way
 
03:53:22.190 --> 03:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
to do this for context before we had the
 
03:53:23.870 --> 03:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
enlistment incentive program we had a
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
small program that was funded at about
 
03:53:28.190 --> 03:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
25 000 a year called the New Hampshire
 
03:53:30.410 --> 03:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
National Guard scholarship fund and it
 
03:53:32.750 --> 03:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
would supplement educational benefits it
 
03:53:35.389 --> 03:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
was a redundant need so when we when we
 
03:53:37.550 --> 03:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
found strategically that our biggest
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
strategic issue was recruiting
 
03:53:43.130 --> 03:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
we decided and retention we decided to
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
turn that program into this
 
03:53:46.910 --> 03:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
in the previous scholarship program
 
03:53:49.309 --> 03:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
those fines were allocated to that
 
03:53:50.809 --> 03:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
so it only made sense for us to do it
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
this way right so we the short answer is
 
03:53:56.990 --> 03:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't give any thought to giving
 
03:53:58.370 --> 03:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
them anywhere else it just made sense
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
for them to go here but I'm going to
 
03:54:04.729 --> 03:54:04.739 align:start position:0%
assure you that military Justice and
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
Military discipline in uniform code of
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
military Justice that due process that
 
03:54:10.490 --> 03:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hold up that we just start
 
03:54:11.929 --> 03:54:11.939 align:start position:0%
punishing people to fill this up I'm
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
telling you it would be like it would be
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
like the courts doing it it would be
 
03:54:18.950 --> 03:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
like you know 1950s Louisiana you know
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying it would that's not
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:26.990 --> 03:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
General Patton said something about
 
03:54:29.809 --> 03:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
Louisiana but I we will go there at this
 
03:54:32.750 --> 03:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
time other questions for uh
 
03:54:35.450 --> 03:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
Miss Perry
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%

committee again for the record my name
 
03:54:54.170 --> 03:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
is Kevin Grady 25-year Air Force veteran
 
03:54:56.630 --> 03:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
23-year resident of the town of Hooksett
 
03:54:58.729 --> 03:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
the state veterans advisory committee
 
03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
was briefed on this bill by by Colonel
 
03:55:04.070 --> 03:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
Perry at our last meeting and we we
 
03:55:05.570 --> 03:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
supported it pending seeing the language
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
and now that I've seen the language we
 
03:55:09.830 --> 03:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
do wholeheartedly support this and our
 
03:55:12.889 --> 03:55:12.899 align:start position:0%
20 veteran service organizations when we
 
03:55:14.330 --> 03:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
Branch out and talk to other people
 
03:55:16.429 --> 03:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
we're part of this this recruiting
 
03:55:18.290 --> 03:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
effort for for trying to get the guard
 
03:55:21.650 --> 03:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
and get folks you know because as they
 
03:55:23.689 --> 03:55:23.699 align:start position:0%
said 80 percent are have some relative
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
that has served of the people that are
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
coming on active duty so I mean I'm
 
03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
coming into the guard so we you know
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
we're we're proud to help be part of
 
03:55:33.530 --> 03:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
this effort Colonel Perry called covered
 
03:55:35.389 --> 03:55:35.399 align:start position:0%
all of the rule making part of this
 
03:55:37.010 --> 03:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
thing and I'm not going to talk to that
 
03:55:38.809 --> 03:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
because frankly as a fighter pilot
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and stuff like that makes my
 
03:55:42.590 --> 03:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
head hurt so I'm gonna I'm gonna pass
 
03:55:44.570 --> 03:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
that but the the increase in the amount
 
03:55:47.570 --> 03:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
we we support that you know it's uh you
 
03:55:49.370 --> 03:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
want to get the kids attention if you
 
03:55:52.130 --> 03:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
possibly can we're also in support of
 
03:55:54.530 --> 03:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
the the other bill this is the some of
 
03:55:56.570 --> 03:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
the recruiting and retention piece we're
 
03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
also support of Senate Bill 45 which is
 
03:56:01.250 --> 03:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh part of the retention piece that
 
03:56:02.929 --> 03:56:02.939 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'll be seeing coming this
 
03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
direction soon so we do fully support
 
03:56:06.170 --> 03:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
this bill and subject to your questions
 
03:56:07.309 --> 03:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's all I wanted to tell you this
 
03:56:09.050 --> 03:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
03:56:13.429 --> 03:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir thanks thanks
 
03:56:17.330 --> 03:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
for putting up with me is there anyone
 
03:56:20.269 --> 03:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
else who like yes uh Madam chair I mean
 
03:56:23.330 --> 03:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk I just got a promotion
 
03:56:25.729 --> 03:56:25.739 align:start position:0%
um I did have one question of the Prime
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
sponsors I'm reflecting on some of the
 
03:56:30.910 --> 03:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that has come forward
 
03:56:33.830 --> 03:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has any thought
 
03:56:38.090 --> 03:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
been given to indexing the costs and the
 
03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
the increase in the retention uh amount
 
03:56:45.050 --> 03:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
such that it reflects our changing
 
03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
Society so that they won't have to come
 
03:56:50.330 --> 03:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
back periodically and amend us
 
03:56:50.340 --> 03:56:51.650 align:start position:0%
back periodically and amend us
uh

03:56:51.650 --> 03:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:56:55.370 --> 03:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
the short answer is no and the one
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
reason is that as long as
 
03:57:00.650 --> 03:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
I mean an incentive
 
03:57:03.229 --> 03:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
an incentive payment just needs to be
 
03:57:04.849 --> 03:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
big enough to get someone's attention
 
03:57:07.670 --> 03:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
and say yes this is this is an incentive
 
03:57:08.809 --> 03:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
to make me
 
03:57:10.969 --> 03:57:10.979 align:start position:0%
choose to sign up this week instead of
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
next week or whatever
 
03:57:16.849 --> 03:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't expect it to be
 
03:57:20.570 --> 03:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
straight out indexed that's the not the
 
03:57:23.150 --> 03:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of an incentive payment but it
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
will give it a few years and see if it's
 
03:57:28.790 --> 03:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
if well the need for the incentive also
 
03:57:28.800 --> 03:57:29.929 align:start position:0%
if well the need for the incentive also
changes

03:57:29.929 --> 03:57:29.939 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
right now with the need for incentives
 
03:57:33.710 --> 03:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
is very high
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the future it may become less
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
necessary I mean if we have a major
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
recession and people are looking for
 
03:57:41.689 --> 03:57:41.699 align:start position:0%
jobs I'm sure that the
 
03:57:44.450 --> 03:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
the recruitment will be much easier
 
03:57:47.570 --> 03:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
so I think that it's up to the
 
03:57:50.689 --> 03:57:50.699 align:start position:0%
Department to decide if they need to
 
03:57:52.610 --> 03:57:52.620 align:start position:0%
adjust the amount to be to make it
 
03:57:52.620 --> 03:57:55.929 align:start position:0%
adjust the amount to be to make it
functional

03:57:55.929 --> 03:57:55.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.370 --> 03:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to speak to this
 
03:57:58.380 --> 03:58:00.349 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to speak to this
measure

03:58:00.349 --> 03:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
measure
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:07.250 --> 03:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
to representative Maguire's point I
 
03:58:09.170 --> 03:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
would just say that the the incentive
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
program is contingent on the general
 
03:58:13.370 --> 03:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
court approving an appropriation so
 
03:58:16.370 --> 03:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
that's another way we can index
 
03:58:18.650 --> 03:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:58:20.510 --> 03:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no more
 
03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
potential speakers we will call a close
 
03:58:27.170 --> 03:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
to this hearing on
 
03:58:31.750 --> 03:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
on HB 330 and we'll plunge ahead to uh
 
03:58:34.490 --> 03:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
hcr3 house concurrent resolution 3 the
 
03:58:37.729 --> 03:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of that measure is here
 
03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.720 --> 03:58:43.689 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:58:43.689 --> 03:58:43.699 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:58:46.370 --> 03:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of the
 
03:58:48.170 --> 03:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:58:51.050 --> 03:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
Jason Gerhard represent mayor Mack 25
 
03:58:53.210 --> 03:58:53.220 align:start position:0%
towns of Northfield and Franklin
 
03:58:54.530 --> 03:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
so I know we're really behind schedule
 
03:58:56.870 --> 03:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to streamline this I know it's
 
03:58:58.610 --> 03:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
a long bill
 
03:59:02.090 --> 03:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
the key part of this I believe is
 
03:59:03.710 --> 03:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
article 7 of the State Constitution
 
03:59:06.110 --> 03:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
State sovereignty real quick the people
 
03:59:07.550 --> 03:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
of the state have the sole and exclusive
 
03:59:09.410 --> 03:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
right of governing themselves as a free
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
Sovereign and independent state and do
 
03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
and forever Hereafter shall exercise and
 
03:59:15.170 --> 03:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
enjoy every Power of jurisdiction and
 
03:59:17.090 --> 03:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
rape pertaining there too which is not
 
03:59:19.070 --> 03:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
or may not here after be by them
 
03:59:20.510 --> 03:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
expressly delegated to the United States
 
03:59:22.849 --> 03:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
American Congress assembled
 
03:59:22.859 --> 03:59:25.010 align:start position:0%
American Congress assembled
so

03:59:25.010 --> 03:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:27.650 --> 03:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
we've come very far from that I believe
 
03:59:30.349 --> 03:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
it's 46 of our funding for the state
 
03:59:31.250 --> 03:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
government comes from the federal
 
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
government now
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
much of it with strings attached
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
and much of it introduced through the
 
03:59:39.530 --> 03:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
executive council with little oversight
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
just due to the sheer volume of money
 
03:59:44.389 --> 03:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
coming in which is unfortunate so this
 
03:59:44.399 --> 03:59:46.969 align:start position:0%
coming in which is unfortunate so this
bill

03:59:46.969 --> 03:59:46.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:49.790 --> 03:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
basically says we got to kind of go back
 
03:59:51.830 --> 03:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
to where we came from and really
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
look back to the spirit
 
03:59:56.269 --> 03:59:56.279 align:start position:0%
with which the Constitution State
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the Federal
 
04:00:00.769 --> 04:00:00.779 align:start position:0%
Constitution were adopted
 
04:00:03.290 --> 04:00:03.300 align:start position:0%
and I like to ask myself would people
 
04:00:05.450 --> 04:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
nowadays be willing to join the Federal
 
04:00:07.790 --> 04:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
Union as it stands
 
04:00:09.530 --> 04:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
if we took a vote would people really
 
04:00:11.030 --> 04:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
want to sign up for what we have going
 
04:00:13.729 --> 04:00:13.739 align:start position:0%
on from all the unconstitutional Wars to
 
04:00:16.610 --> 04:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
just the sheer bureaucratic mess I mean
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
look at the IRS it just the things have
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
gotten so
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
nobody really knows what's going on
 
04:00:24.710 --> 04:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's my basic point just due to the
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
sheer volume
 
04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
and thankfully New Hampshire with 400
 
04:00:30.410 --> 04:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
State reps we have a much more Hands-On
 
04:00:31.910 --> 04:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
approach to state government which is
 
04:00:35.090 --> 04:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
great it really is so last part this is
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
the final paragraph of the bill line 20
 
04:00:39.950 --> 04:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
that faithful to that compact according
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
to the plain intent and meaning in which
 
04:00:43.070 --> 04:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
it was understood and is seated to by
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
the several parties it is sincerely
 
04:00:46.550 --> 04:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
anxious for its preservation that it
 
04:00:48.530 --> 04:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
also does believe that to take from the
 
04:00:50.210 --> 04:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
states all the powers of self-government
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
and transfer them to a general and
 
04:00:53.809 --> 04:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Government without regard
 
04:00:55.130 --> 04:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
to the special delegations and
 
04:00:57.229 --> 04:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
reservations solemnly agreed to in that
 
04:00:59.870 --> 04:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
compact is not for the peace happiness
 
04:01:02.450 --> 04:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
or prosperity of these states and that
 
04:01:03.889 --> 04:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
therefore this state is determined as
 
04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
its doubts not its coast states are to
 
04:01:08.510 --> 04:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
submit to undelegated and consequently
 
04:01:10.729 --> 04:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
unlimited powers and no man or body of
 
04:01:13.010 --> 04:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
men on Earth that in cases of an abuse
 
04:01:14.630 --> 04:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
of the delegated powers the members of
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
the general government being chosen by
 
04:01:18.050 --> 04:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
the people A Change by the people would
 
04:01:20.210 --> 04:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
be the Constitutional remedy but where
 
04:01:21.710 --> 04:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
powers are assumed which have not been
 
04:01:24.410 --> 04:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
delegated a nullification is the act
 
04:01:26.450 --> 04:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
of the ACT is the rightful remedy that
 
04:01:27.889 --> 04:01:27.899 align:start position:0%
every state is a natural right and cases
 
04:01:29.689 --> 04:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
not within the compact to nullify of
 
04:01:31.429 --> 04:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
their own authority all assumptions of
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
Power by others within their limits that
 
04:01:34.849 --> 04:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
without this right they would be under
 
04:01:36.530 --> 04:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
the Dominion absolute and unlimited of
 
04:01:37.910 --> 04:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
whoever might exercise this right of
 
04:01:39.410 --> 04:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
judgment for them
 
04:01:41.870 --> 04:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
and that's basically the gist of what
 
04:01:44.330 --> 04:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
the uh the rationale behind this bill
 
04:01:46.130 --> 04:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
because if we're not if we're not going
 
04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
to establish ourselves a sovereign
 
04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
independent state what's the point we're
 
04:01:50.510 --> 04:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
just an administrative unit of the
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
federal government so let's just disband
 
04:01:53.570 --> 04:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
state government
 
04:01:56.150 --> 04:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
save ourselves the money and just let's
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
go from there because I just don't see
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
the point anymore so otherwise we're
 
04:02:01.370 --> 04:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
just doing we're just doing like cosplay
 
04:02:02.750 --> 04:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know we're just kind of it's all
 
04:02:04.790 --> 04:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
theater so yeah so if you have any
 
04:02:07.610 --> 04:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
questions I'd appreciate it and that's
 
04:02:09.530 --> 04:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh I have a
 
04:02:14.570 --> 04:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
question and there may be some others to
 
04:02:16.490 --> 04:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
follow and I know we have at least one
 
04:02:18.410 --> 04:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
person one other person has signed up to
 
04:02:18.420 --> 04:02:19.910 align:start position:0%
person one other person has signed up to
speak

04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:02:22.729 --> 04:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
um all the whereas is uh
 
04:02:24.650 --> 04:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
I want to reread those I think any
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
resolution the whereas is uh really make
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
the case for that but my question to you
 
04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
is um from what you just read
 
04:02:36.769 --> 04:02:36.779 align:start position:0%
um on line 30 it mentions the
 
04:02:38.809 --> 04:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
Nullification of the ACT to
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
nullification of the ACT is the rifle
 
04:02:42.650 --> 04:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
remedy in other words as I understand
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
what you just read
 
04:02:44.880 --> 04:02:45.710 align:start position:0%
what you just read
um

04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
the action that it is needed to be taken
 
04:02:53.229 --> 04:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
is a nullification in other words
 
04:02:55.969 --> 04:02:55.979 align:start position:0%
essentially cancellation
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
so it would be helpful to visualize
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
or to get your vision of this if you
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
could give us a like a specific example
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
of something that might be nullified so
 
04:03:10.610 --> 04:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
that I or weak and better understand how
 
04:03:12.769 --> 04:03:12.779 align:start position:0%
this might be implemented well let's use
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
a let's say a minimal example I think
 
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's kind of funny at a state of Montana
 
04:03:17.809 --> 04:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
so the feds came in and said if you want
 
04:03:19.370 --> 04:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
your state funding I'm sorry the highway
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
funds they had to Institute a speed
 
04:03:24.530 --> 04:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
limit so Montana said okay they create a
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
law that going over this the speed limit
 
04:03:28.490 --> 04:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
would be wasting of Natural Resources
 
04:03:30.950 --> 04:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's like a 50 fine they never issued
 
04:03:32.990 --> 04:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
one ticket so that's how states can
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
nullify Federal overreach they play
 
04:03:37.250 --> 04:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
these games where they collect the money
 
04:03:38.929 --> 04:03:38.939 align:start position:0%
for us allegedly and say you want the
 
04:03:41.809 --> 04:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
money back you got to dance so at a
 
04:03:43.849 --> 04:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
certain point how many how far will you
 
04:03:45.650 --> 04:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
go before you say okay we're not really
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
independent at this point none of the
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
stuff that they're doing is
 
04:03:54.170 --> 04:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:01.250 --> 04:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:02.570 --> 04:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
whereas the Constitution United States
 
04:04:04.250 --> 04:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
having delegated to Congress to power to
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
punish treason counterfeiting the
 
04:04:07.070 --> 04:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
Securities and current coin in the
 
04:04:08.689 --> 04:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
United States piracies and felonies
 
04:04:10.610 --> 04:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
committed on the high seas offense
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
against the law of Nations and slavery
 
04:04:14.570 --> 04:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
and no other crimes whatsoever
 
04:04:16.189 --> 04:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
now we can argue that there's some good
 
04:04:18.349 --> 04:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
federal laws on the books but why aren't
 
04:04:21.290 --> 04:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
we enacting those laws
 
04:04:25.450 --> 04:04:25.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:27.889 --> 04:04:27.899 align:start position:0%
when you say we you're talking about the
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
state level yes I thought we were having
 
04:04:31.070 --> 04:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
a conversation I'm addressing yes so
 
04:04:31.080 --> 04:04:32.809 align:start position:0%
a conversation I'm addressing yes so
sure

04:04:32.809 --> 04:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
question other questions for the prime
 
04:04:34.800 --> 04:04:39.110 align:start position:0%
question other questions for the prime
sponsor

04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:40.490 --> 04:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you representative
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
04:04:44.689 --> 04:04:44.699 align:start position:0%
time have a uh card here from uh Frank
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:56.330 --> 04:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
so yeah I support I support this bill uh
 
04:04:58.969 --> 04:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be brief you were asking uh
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard to explain
 
04:05:00.720 --> 04:05:02.210 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard to explain
nullification

04:05:02.210 --> 04:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
nullification
 
04:05:04.269 --> 04:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
I would suggest going to the 10th
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
amendmentcenter.com they also have a lot
 
04:05:09.950 --> 04:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
of YouTube videos and they cover all the
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
different legislation uh the
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
Nullification legislation that gets put
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
forth across the 50 states a number of
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
these uh here in New Hampshire have been
 
04:05:21.410 --> 04:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
featured on this guy's website and
 
04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
YouTube channel
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
and he explains it very well and there's
 
04:05:27.889 --> 04:05:27.899 align:start position:0%
different ways to nullify number one is
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
nullifying in the first person I've been
 
04:05:30.239 --> 04:05:31.969 align:start position:0%
nullifying in the first person I've been
nullifying

04:05:31.969 --> 04:05:31.979 align:start position:0%
nullifying
 
04:05:31.979 --> 04:05:32.870 align:start position:0%
nullifying
um

04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
the courts trying to ban people from
 
04:05:38.689 --> 04:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
filming okay I've been doing that the
 
04:05:41.210 --> 04:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
cops get called Supreme Court hits the
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
emergency button there's no law
 
04:05:45.410 --> 04:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
the Supreme one of the Supreme Court
 
04:05:47.570 --> 04:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
Justices just put out this order saying
 
04:05:50.269 --> 04:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
that nobody can film and they use rule
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
19 as the backing in rule 19 actually
 
04:05:56.450 --> 04:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
gives us the right to film in court
 
04:06:00.670 --> 04:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
so these are the ways to nullify
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislation is you guys's job me I
 
04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
nullify in person I speak with my feet
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
and I do not obey unconstitutional laws
 
04:06:12.170 --> 04:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
04:06:14.990 --> 04:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution is more
 
04:06:17.870 --> 04:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
protective than the Federal Constitution
 
04:06:19.969 --> 04:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
we all know this I hope
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
and supremacy clause defers to the ninth
 
04:06:27.290 --> 04:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
and Tenth Amendment which gives New
 
04:06:27.300 --> 04:06:28.150 align:start position:0%
and Tenth Amendment which gives New
Hampshire

04:06:28.150 --> 04:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:06:31.250 --> 04:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
Constitution Supremacy over New
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens as well as the people
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
and I believe I don't know how this
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
could be implemented at anything but
 
04:06:44.809 --> 04:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
we should not be arguing from federal
 
04:06:48.229 --> 04:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
law in this state ever because of the
 
04:06:50.750 --> 04:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
fact that our state constitution is more
 
04:06:54.170 --> 04:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
protective on religion firearms and
 
04:06:55.790 --> 04:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
everything else we have the right to
 
04:06:57.769 --> 04:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
Revolution built in
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
I mean it goes on and on so I don't know
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
if there could be something put in there
 
04:07:07.450 --> 04:07:07.460 align:start position:0%
in this this article 7 that says we have
 
04:07:11.450 --> 04:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
Supremacy and that all cases should be
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
argued from the state constitution and
 
04:07:16.490 --> 04:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
not the Federal Constitution because we
 
04:07:19.189 --> 04:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
are more protective and uh that's all I
 
04:07:21.469 --> 04:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
have to say thank you
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
would you submit any questions sure
 
04:07:29.809 --> 04:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:32.090 --> 04:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
say none thank you for taking the time
 
04:07:34.250 --> 04:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
to speak to us today
 
04:07:37.130 --> 04:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
04:07:38.450 --> 04:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
does anyone else
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
would anyone else like to speak to this
 
04:07:40.680 --> 04:07:44.330 align:start position:0%
would anyone else like to speak to this
measure

04:07:44.330 --> 04:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.010 --> 04:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:52.250 --> 04:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
we will end this hearing on hcr3 which
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
will bring us to hcr4 which actually is
 
04:07:57.530 --> 04:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 1 45 interestingly
 
04:08:01.250 --> 04:08:01.260 align:start position:0%

okay

04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:06.840 --> 04:09:53.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:09:53.650 --> 04:09:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:59.090 --> 04:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:59.100 --> 04:10:41.389 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:10:41.389 --> 04:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:41.399 --> 04:10:43.250 align:start position:0%
 
it's

04:10:43.250 --> 04:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:10:43.260 --> 04:15:02.710 align:start position:0%
it's
um

04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:07.010 --> 04:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:09.650 --> 04:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
yeah you're cooking supper and pour me a

yes

04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
foreign okay it being 145 146 uh we will
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
move to uh the next measure house
 
04:15:57.170 --> 04:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution for
 
04:15:59.870 --> 04:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor reps and Wallace is
 
04:16:03.170 --> 04:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
here welcome representative Wallace
 
04:16:05.090 --> 04:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman moffatt members of
 
04:16:07.130 --> 04:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
the committee colleagues
 
04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is
 
04:16:10.490 --> 04:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative Scott Wallace Rockingham
 
04:16:13.849 --> 04:16:13.859 align:start position:0%
County District 8 not 33 as it says on
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of you that is the
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
town of Danville
 
04:16:21.349 --> 04:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
and just further clarification this may
 
04:16:24.189 --> 04:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
be an older resolution for some reason
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
as I haven't represented District 33 in
 
04:16:30.290 --> 04:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
six years uh but that being said the
 
04:16:32.870 --> 04:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
content of the the bill is correct
 
04:16:34.370 --> 04:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
um before you house concurrent
 
04:16:36.769 --> 04:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
resolution 4 is urging Congress to call
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
an article 5 Convention of the states
 
04:16:40.370 --> 04:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of establishing term
 
04:16:42.889 --> 04:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
limits for congress and federal
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies and office holders
 
04:16:45.600 --> 04:16:47.030 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies and office holders
um

04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:50.150 --> 04:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
although New Hampshire has not been
 
04:16:52.130 --> 04:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
directly impacted by long-serving
 
04:16:54.170 --> 04:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
members of our federal delegation we've
 
04:16:56.570 --> 04:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
been indirectly impacted by long-term
 
04:16:58.729 --> 04:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
long long-serving members of other
 
04:16:58.739 --> 04:16:59.750 align:start position:0%
long long-serving members of other
states

04:16:59.750 --> 04:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:17:01.490 --> 04:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
that have defeated many measures that
 
04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
would have helped the state long term
 
04:17:05.809 --> 04:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
Congress is out of control control I
 
04:17:07.849 --> 04:17:07.859 align:start position:0%
think we're all in agreeance on that and
 
04:17:09.729 --> 04:17:09.739 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
Congress will never rein in itself as
 
04:17:13.729 --> 04:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
evidenced by the fact that they have
 
04:17:15.950 --> 04:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
proposed terminals on themselves more
 
04:17:19.849 --> 04:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
than 275 times over the last 275 years
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
so expecting them to reign in their own
 
04:17:25.370 --> 04:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh abuse of power is analogous of
 
04:17:27.590 --> 04:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
expecting a drug addict to seek
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
treatment on their own volition I don't
 
04:17:32.929 --> 04:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
think that's going to happen so we're
 
04:17:35.150 --> 04:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
going to ask Congress I mean the several
 
04:17:37.130 --> 04:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
states to bring in their power through
 
04:17:39.530 --> 04:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
Article Five and I'll be happy to take
 
04:17:42.610 --> 04:17:42.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.809 --> 04:17:44.819 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions for
 
04:17:46.010 --> 04:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor representative
 
04:17:46.020 --> 04:17:47.389 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor representative
Lundgren

04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
Lundgren
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh how many states
 
04:17:53.689 --> 04:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
do you know of right now that are are
 
04:17:56.170 --> 04:17:56.180 align:start position:0%
instituting this or trying to
 
04:17:59.450 --> 04:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
from at this point in time there are I
 
04:18:01.969 --> 04:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
believe 11 or 13 states with term limits
 
04:18:05.330 --> 04:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
resolutions uh valid and being held at
 
04:18:09.130 --> 04:18:09.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins
 
04:18:15.290 --> 04:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair how long do you how
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
long would you propose for terms how
 
04:18:19.790 --> 04:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
many terms for the Senate and how many
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
terms would you give to the house that's
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
going to be a reasonable answer for that
 
04:18:25.610 --> 04:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question it's an
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
excellent question but that is not going
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
to be determined here or today that
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
would be determined once the convention
 
04:18:33.290 --> 04:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
is called and the several States would
 
04:18:35.929 --> 04:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
have input to that at this point in time
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
the the uh consensus is that it would
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
likely be three terms in Congress
 
04:18:45.349 --> 04:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
um and two terms in the senate for a
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
total of uh 12 in each body with a break
 
04:18:50.450 --> 04:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
in between so you could serve in
 
04:18:51.849 --> 04:18:51.859 align:start position:0%
Congress for
 
04:18:55.729 --> 04:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
uh you know 12 years take a break of a
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
term and then go serve in the upper
 
04:18:58.849 --> 04:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
chamber in the Senate if you were
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to do that the idea is
 
04:19:04.010 --> 04:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
to break the uh the Stranglehold that
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
many of these members have on the uh on
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
the on Congress
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:19.370 --> 04:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
seeing uh thank you representative
 
04:19:24.050 --> 04:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
Wallace thank you
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
former Senator Rubens is still with us
 
04:19:27.769 --> 04:19:27.779 align:start position:0%
and he has signed up in support of the
 
04:19:27.779 --> 04:19:28.729 align:start position:0%
and he has signed up in support of the
bill

04:19:28.729 --> 04:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:19:30.650 --> 04:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Rubens
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm going to
 
04:19:34.729 --> 04:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
submit the same written testimony that I
 
04:19:37.729 --> 04:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
did this morning did anyone not get it
 
04:19:39.110 --> 04:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
they're all good
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that so I'm not going
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
to repeat any of that except to say that
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor a little background again
 
04:19:47.030 --> 04:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of all the three major
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
amendments that are very popular with
 
04:19:52.550 --> 04:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
the American public term limits fiscal
 
04:19:55.010 --> 04:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
restraint and a fix some kind of limit
 
04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
to campaign money
 
04:19:58.729 --> 04:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
all of these three issues are supported
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
by super majorities of Americans in both
 
04:20:04.250 --> 04:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
parties poll after poll over over a long
 
04:20:06.410 --> 04:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
period of time but replicated this and
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
Congress won't act on these so here's
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
going back to my experience I've been
 
04:20:12.110 --> 04:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
involved in the amending movement for
 
04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
all of these for a solid 10 years plus
 
04:20:17.630 --> 04:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
and so I've been able to generate
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
meetings with members of Congress on
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
what I called a grand bargain which was
 
04:20:24.769 --> 04:20:24.779 align:start position:0%
to have a term limits Bill and a
 
04:20:26.750 --> 04:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
campaign finance bill which are
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
typically two different uh two different
 
04:20:30.469 --> 04:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
resolutions before Congress to amend the
 
04:20:32.929 --> 04:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
Constitution one of them term limits
 
04:20:34.189 --> 04:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
tends to be supported more by
 
04:20:36.410 --> 04:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
Republicans the campaign money Amendment
 
04:20:38.750 --> 04:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
tends in the last session of Congress
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
supported by every Democratic member of
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
Congress So I says let's let's go in and
 
04:20:45.410 --> 04:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
meet with some Republicans and Democrats
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the subject of pairing the two
 
04:20:49.010 --> 04:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
amendments together in Congress we had
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
some great meetings those of us who had
 
04:20:52.250 --> 04:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
these meetings with actual members of
 
04:20:54.710 --> 04:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
Congress took a while to get them and
 
04:20:56.570 --> 04:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
they they thought this idea is great
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
wonderful and so we'd follow up in a
 
04:21:00.530 --> 04:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
week or two they'd say they'd get back
 
04:21:01.969 --> 04:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
to we'd follow up a week or two later
 
04:21:04.610 --> 04:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
three weeks later nothing radio silence
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
what happened is we finally got the
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
report they took the concept up to up to
 
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
leadership both the Democrat and
 
04:21:12.110 --> 04:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
Republican leadership of the House and
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
Senate and vetoed
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
because the system that Congress has
 
04:21:19.490 --> 04:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
right now of unlimited debt unlimited
 
04:21:22.450 --> 04:21:22.460 align:start position:0%
terms of office unlimited Federal power
 
04:21:26.090 --> 04:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
they love it and Leadership loves the
 
04:21:27.530 --> 04:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
system they have right now and so the
 
04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
the the lesson of all this in my 10
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
years of attempts with these kind of
 
04:21:35.210 --> 04:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
btices Congress is not going to give
 
04:21:35.220 --> 04:21:36.410 align:start position:0%
btices Congress is not going to give
people

04:21:36.410 --> 04:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
what the people of America want on any
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
of the three subjects term limits
 
04:21:42.530 --> 04:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
campaign money reform and debt limits
 
04:21:44.929 --> 04:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
Congress is not going to do that for
 
04:21:47.389 --> 04:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
itself and so I'm arguing in the case
 
04:21:51.290 --> 04:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
for for this particular hcr4 this is the
 
04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
framers gave us this power
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
because in it they foresaw that Congress
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
could One Day become as I mentioned this
 
04:22:01.250 --> 04:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
morning become unaccountable or even you
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
could call it corrupt unresponsive to
 
04:22:05.630 --> 04:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
the will of the people so this power was
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
given to the states to in the case of
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should you uh should you
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh propose and uh and and and agree to
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
this hcr4 this gives you the appointed
 
04:22:22.370 --> 04:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
the ability should 34 States agree to
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
this subject matter to appoint delegates
 
04:22:26.689 --> 04:22:26.699 align:start position:0%
they will be limited to debating the
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
subject matter at hand here and
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
determining what kind of term limits uh
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
the delegates would prefer to see but
 
04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
and again I'm rebutting rebutting what
 
04:22:36.250 --> 04:22:36.260 align:start position:0%
the opponents have said to this bill
 
04:22:39.530 --> 04:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
this amending convention limited to that
 
04:22:41.570 --> 04:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
single subject
 
04:22:44.330 --> 04:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
even if they ran away they have no power
 
04:22:46.490 --> 04:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
to do anything anything that a
 
04:22:48.349 --> 04:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
convention for proposing amendments
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
might propose no matter how weird no
 
04:22:54.410 --> 04:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
matter how how good it has no force in
 
04:22:57.170 --> 04:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
effect until subsequently ratified by
 
04:22:59.349 --> 04:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
three quarter three thirty eight states
 
04:23:02.210 --> 04:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
this amending convention that people are
 
04:23:05.150 --> 04:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
some people are generating so much fear
 
04:23:09.290 --> 04:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
about it has no power whatsoever it can
 
04:23:11.450 --> 04:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
only propose just like we here are
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
proposing this bill to you we have no
 
04:23:15.410 --> 04:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
power you're the people who decide so
 
04:23:17.330 --> 04:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
the so the the fact of the matter is
 
04:23:20.630 --> 04:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
that 13 of 99 legislative bodies around
 
04:23:23.269 --> 04:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
the country have absolute veto power
 
04:23:26.269 --> 04:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
over anything that might be proposed by
 
04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
an amending convention on any subject
 
04:23:30.889 --> 04:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
whatsoever run away or or limited
 
04:23:33.290 --> 04:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
properly and that means that any
 
04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment including on-term
 
04:23:38.809 --> 04:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
limits here must be massively supported
 
04:23:41.210 --> 04:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
by the public across the ideological
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
specter term otherwise it's Dead on
 
04:23:45.769 --> 04:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
Arrival so I would encourage you folks
 
04:23:49.670 --> 04:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
there is an appetite by the public to
 
04:23:52.309 --> 04:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
see debate and the generation of
 
04:23:54.290 --> 04:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
language with respect to term limits
 
04:23:57.050 --> 04:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be wrestled out
 
04:23:58.969 --> 04:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
by by delegates to this convention
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
proposing amendments see if they can
 
04:24:03.530 --> 04:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
come up some great language and see if
 
04:24:05.450 --> 04:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
the state's 38 of which are required to
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
ratify have an appetite for this luck
 
04:24:10.969 --> 04:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
the public express its will through you
 
04:24:13.250 --> 04:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
folks who will who will Who will appoint
 
04:24:15.590 --> 04:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
the delegates and I I have confidence in
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
you folks to to to to appoint delegates
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
who will be constructive who will be
 
04:24:23.210 --> 04:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
creative who will listen to all sides of
 
04:24:25.729 --> 04:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
the equation recognizing that all the
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
work they're doing is Dead on Arrival
 
04:24:30.290 --> 04:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
unless it makes sense to a broad broad
 
04:24:33.050 --> 04:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
swath of Americans so I heartily
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
heartily endorse an ought to pass on
 
04:24:38.210 --> 04:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you
 
04:24:40.189 --> 04:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
you take any questions of course of
 
04:24:42.290 --> 04:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
course okay Sarah I have one and there
 
04:24:44.150 --> 04:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
may be others to follow my my question I
 
04:24:46.969 --> 04:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
I could have asked the prime as well
 
04:24:49.790 --> 04:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh we have amended our constitution in
 
04:24:52.729 --> 04:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
the past uh we've put a term limits uh
 
04:24:55.010 --> 04:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
amendment in with regard to the chief
 
04:24:57.050 --> 04:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
executive is a presidential tournament
 
04:24:59.450 --> 04:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
is an amendment constitutional amendment
 
04:25:01.610 --> 04:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
that came about in the more traditional
 
04:25:05.210 --> 04:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
fashion yeah now that measure that
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
amendment when it passed did not apply
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
to the president which was Truman at the
 
04:25:10.199 --> 04:25:11.750 align:start position:0%
to the president which was Truman at the
time

04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:25:13.849 --> 04:25:13.859 align:start position:0%
um it would have it did
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
apply to subsequent presidents but not
 
04:25:18.650 --> 04:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
the current president so my question is
 
04:25:21.410 --> 04:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
if if some sort of a term limits measure
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
was to move forward in in this this
 
04:25:26.689 --> 04:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
other uh through this other mechanism
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
would it immediate when would it would
 
04:25:32.929 --> 04:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
it affect uh how would it affect
 
04:25:35.870 --> 04:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
existing office holders that would be up
 
04:25:37.610 --> 04:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
to the delegates at the amending
 
04:25:39.769 --> 04:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
convention to to wrestle out that
 
04:25:41.809 --> 04:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
question what the terms of office might
 
04:25:43.689 --> 04:25:43.699 align:start position:0%
be what offices it might apply to
 
04:25:46.910 --> 04:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
whether it be uh applying to existing
 
04:25:50.809 --> 04:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
members or not and and they would use a
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
great deal of judgment and again they'd
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
be they'd be looking at what works what
 
04:25:56.750 --> 04:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
is the best for the American people what
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
might get ratified so I those questions
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
will be answered by the delegates which
 
04:26:03.530 --> 04:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
is why again I'm trusting you folks you
 
04:26:05.090 --> 04:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
are the people who will determine the
 
04:26:07.130 --> 04:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
kind of delegates who will wrestle with
 
04:26:08.929 --> 04:26:08.939 align:start position:0%
these exact kind of questions and
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully come up with a very workable
 
04:26:10.439 --> 04:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
hopefully come up with a very workable
answer

04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:26:13.010 --> 04:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the answer will be
 
04:26:15.290 --> 04:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
but again confidence in you folks to
 
04:26:16.969 --> 04:26:16.979 align:start position:0%
appoint delegates who will work very
 
04:26:18.410 --> 04:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
very hard to answer the questions
 
04:26:18.420 --> 04:26:20.030 align:start position:0%
very hard to answer the questions
properly

04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
properly
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give myself a follow-up
 
04:26:24.889 --> 04:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
Senator and ask you uh personally if you
 
04:26:27.050 --> 04:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
were a delegate would you want this uh
 
04:26:29.210 --> 04:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
amendment to apply to
 
04:26:32.090 --> 04:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
um sitting sitting Senate uh or sitting
 
04:26:33.710 --> 04:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
Congressional office holders what what
 
04:26:35.450 --> 04:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
would what would your position be if I
 
04:26:37.969 --> 04:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
could ask I I would be very aware of the
 
04:26:40.610 --> 04:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
need for the 38 uh State through
 
04:26:42.590 --> 04:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
ratification threshold and the the
 
04:26:44.450 --> 04:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
influence of sitting members of Congress
 
04:26:46.729 --> 04:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
on the decisions of those various States
 
04:26:49.250 --> 04:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I would tend to exempt sitting
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
members or at least for a certain period
 
04:26:53.450 --> 04:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
of time maybe another uh term that'd be
 
04:26:55.070 --> 04:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
one possibility let them sit for another
 
04:26:58.490 --> 04:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
office term or two
 
04:27:01.849 --> 04:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
all to be worked out thank you yeah uh
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
other questions for uh Senator Rubens
 
04:27:07.729 --> 04:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
thank you same none thank you Senator we
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
do have another card uh from
 
04:27:12.910 --> 04:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
Samuel fieldman who spoke earlier today
 
04:27:15.769 --> 04:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
representing wolf pack which is neutral
 
04:27:18.649 --> 04:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
but he himself is in a report is in
 
04:27:18.659 --> 04:27:19.490 align:start position:0%
but he himself is in a report is in
support

04:27:19.490 --> 04:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
and again wolf pack is Pac political
 
04:27:30.910 --> 04:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Moffett yes as you
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
said wolf pack is neutral on this we're
 
04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
single issue organization personally I
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
support us term limits and I'm I'm I
 
04:27:41.809 --> 04:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
know that many of the volunteers within
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
Wolfpack also agree with that
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
um the main point that I wanna I wanna
 
04:27:49.729 --> 04:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
drive home is 100 of peer-reviewed
 
04:27:51.830 --> 04:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
sources agree the idea that a limited
 
04:27:53.570 --> 04:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
convention call could result in an
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
amendment on a different topic would be
 
04:27:57.649 --> 04:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
like NASA failing to put a man on the
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
Moon by accidentally Landing him safely
 
04:28:01.729 --> 04:28:01.739 align:start position:0%
on Mars
 
04:28:03.950 --> 04:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
um and next week when we talk about a
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
different convention Bill I'm going to
 
04:28:08.090 --> 04:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
get into more detail on how we know
 
04:28:10.849 --> 04:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
that's true but what I want to drive
 
04:28:13.309 --> 04:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
home right now with a little bit less
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
time is why it feels like that's the
 
04:28:19.090 --> 04:28:19.100 align:start position:0%
opposite of the case why it feels like
 
04:28:22.750 --> 04:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh so many of the reputable sources
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
disagree and the fact is
 
04:28:27.950 --> 04:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a little bit of
 
04:28:31.130 --> 04:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
disinformation going on about providing
 
04:28:33.050 --> 04:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
fall sources and misrepresenting what
 
04:28:34.969 --> 04:28:34.979 align:start position:0%
they say but the vast majority is
 
04:28:37.370 --> 04:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
misinformation people who genuinely have
 
04:28:39.710 --> 04:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
a mistaken belief about what many of the
 
04:28:41.929 --> 04:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
sources say and there's so much of it
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
that it becomes difficult to sort the
 
04:28:46.250 --> 04:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
good sources from the bad which is why
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
the the first article that I sent around
 
04:28:51.769 --> 04:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
in my testimony explains exactly how to
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
do that it cites the reputable sources
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
and it explains the errors and the bad
 
04:28:55.680 --> 04:28:57.469 align:start position:0%
and it explains the errors and the bad
sources

04:28:57.469 --> 04:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
sources
 
04:28:59.330 --> 04:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
um but there's a history behind how that
 
04:29:02.090 --> 04:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
came to be where the reason why we have
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
so many groups that have developed this
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
firm belief and the this information has
 
04:29:08.269 --> 04:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
spread so widely
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
um you could go back much further but
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
the the bulk of it really started uh in
 
04:29:18.290 --> 04:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
1979 uh specifically January 16 1979
 
04:29:18.300 --> 04:29:18.950 align:start position:0%
1979 uh specifically January 16 1979
um

04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
at that point in time the the uh effort
 
04:29:23.809 --> 04:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
for a balanced budget amendment was very
 
04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
close to the the threshold uh depend of
 
04:29:29.090 --> 04:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
convention calls and that's only using
 
04:29:30.889 --> 04:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
convention calls that were limited to
 
04:29:32.990 --> 04:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
that subject matter
 
04:29:35.450 --> 04:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
um the uh and
 
04:29:38.269 --> 04:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
um then the Governor Jerry Brown of
 
04:29:38.279 --> 04:29:39.769 align:start position:0%
um then the Governor Jerry Brown of
California

04:29:39.769 --> 04:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
California
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
um came on board with the balanced
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
budget amendment effort in California to
 
04:29:45.889 --> 04:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
try to get a convention call there now
 
04:29:48.769 --> 04:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
at the time Governor Brown was uh the
 
04:29:51.889 --> 04:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
scene as the main primary Challenger for
 
04:29:53.929 --> 04:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
um for President Carter in the
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
Democratic primary and the Democratic
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
party in uh in the capital freaked out
 
04:29:59.279 --> 04:30:01.189 align:start position:0%
party in uh in the capital freaked out
completely

04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
completely
 
04:30:04.370 --> 04:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
um they wrote a series of memos uh in
 
04:30:06.170 --> 04:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
and one of them I refer to as the screen
 
04:30:08.030 --> 04:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
memo in which they called for doing
 
04:30:10.910 --> 04:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
several things uh they called for six
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
different things three of which they
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
they ended up doing one was holding a
 
04:30:16.610 --> 04:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
hearing specifically to spread fear
 
04:30:18.889 --> 04:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
about the Article 5 convention process
 
04:30:22.130 --> 04:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
another was uh to uh
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
um to start an organization specifically
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
to reach out to people and spread
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
information about dangers of the article
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
5 convention process uh and the uh item
 
04:30:33.649 --> 04:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
six on that list was scream which they
 
04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
certainly did quite loudly I was
 
04:30:36.530 --> 04:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
surprised to see that literally written
 
04:30:39.530 --> 04:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
into the into the memo um circulating in
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Birch bai's office
 
04:30:44.210 --> 04:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
um and uh that's exactly what they did
 
04:30:46.130 --> 04:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
they had that hearing
 
04:30:48.769 --> 04:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
um in November of that year uh despite
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that on that the very same day
 
04:30:56.210 --> 04:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
um uh January 16 1979 uh the department
 
04:30:58.189 --> 04:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
of justice under Jimmy Carter released a
 
04:30:59.689 --> 04:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
memo explaining why the Article 5
 
04:31:02.090 --> 04:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
convention process is safe another one
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
was released that was more comprehensive
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
by President Carter's uh Department of
 
04:31:08.689 --> 04:31:08.699 align:start position:0%
Justice later that year
 
04:31:12.170 --> 04:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
um and the uh excuse me uh Mr Jim point
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
of water yes
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect to the speaker
 
04:31:17.870 --> 04:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
and this is interesting the question
 
04:31:19.969 --> 04:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
before this committee is on the house
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution 4 sending a
 
04:31:24.889 --> 04:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
message to Congress to limit terms of
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
members of Congress and I think we're
 
04:31:28.250 --> 04:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
going back over the Article Five
 
04:31:28.260 --> 04:31:30.229 align:start position:0%
going back over the Article Five
information

04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in this bill that I
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
saw that says right off about Article 5
 
04:31:36.590 --> 04:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
but the heading is to send the
 
04:31:38.269 --> 04:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
legislature send a message to Congress
 
04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with term limitations
 
04:31:43.750 --> 04:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
and so I think to go into what
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
transpires as far as people being sent
 
04:31:50.090 --> 04:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
to an article 5 convention and where
 
04:31:51.889 --> 04:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
it's been done before in false
 
04:31:54.349 --> 04:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
information really is outside the scope
 
04:31:55.610 --> 04:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
of the bill that is before this
 
04:31:57.649 --> 04:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
committee at this time correct me if I'm
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
wrong I was under the impression that
 
04:32:00.530 --> 04:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
this bill does call for an article 5
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
convention is that not correct
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
the measure does mention Article Five so
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
the point of your testimony is you're
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
trying to tie in this particular uh term
 
04:32:15.229 --> 04:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
limits issue to an article five that's
 
04:32:16.729 --> 04:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
what you the thread you're trying to tie
 
04:32:19.070 --> 04:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
together yes okay sure if you can go
 
04:32:21.170 --> 04:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
ahead and and finish tying that together
 
04:32:23.570 --> 04:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely
 
04:32:25.729 --> 04:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
um so many of the groups that you're
 
04:32:27.710 --> 04:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
seeing testify against this now and
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
they've been uh testifying against
 
04:32:31.729 --> 04:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
um it started with fear for the balanced
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
budget amendment but then um an article
 
04:32:36.649 --> 04:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
specifically about U.S term limits was
 
04:32:39.309 --> 04:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
written by Ronald rotunda uh the premier
 
04:32:43.250 --> 04:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
expert on the US Constitution in 1996 I
 
04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
believe specifically about U.S term
 
04:32:47.330 --> 04:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
limits as it relates the Article 5
 
04:32:47.340 --> 04:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
limits as it relates the Article 5
convention

04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
convention
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
um debunking many of these points that
 
04:32:52.849 --> 04:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
had been spread up until that point for
 
04:32:55.130 --> 04:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
the last 15 years
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
um groups that oppose the balanced
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
budget amendment on policy uh ended up
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
tying it in tying that opposition in
 
04:33:04.250 --> 04:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
they found it easier to oppose the can
 
04:33:07.490 --> 04:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
convention issue than to oppose the
 
04:33:09.470 --> 04:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
actual our policy of the balanced budget
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
and then other groups on other subjects
 
04:33:14.269 --> 04:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
including term limits including campaign
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
Finance reform which is what my group
 
04:33:17.810 --> 04:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
works on ended up getting tied into that
 
04:33:20.449 --> 04:33:20.459 align:start position:0%
because it was easier to attack the
 
04:33:23.689 --> 04:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
process than the policy and we've seen
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
that with groups like the John Birch
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
Society and Eagle Forum on the right
 
04:33:29.449 --> 04:33:29.459 align:start position:0%
with common cause and the ACLU on the
 
04:33:29.459 --> 04:33:30.590 align:start position:0%
with common cause and the ACLU on the
left

04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
left
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
um people today have heard those talking
 
04:33:34.730 --> 04:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
points repeated so many times from
 
04:33:36.890 --> 04:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
sources that seem reputable and those
 
04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
sources heard it from sources that seem
 
04:33:41.390 --> 04:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
reputable it makes it very hard to tell
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
the good sources from the bad until you
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
really dive into this and when you look
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
at literally every single peer-reviewed
 
04:33:49.369 --> 04:33:49.379 align:start position:0%
Source on the subject they're in
 
04:33:50.631 --> 04:33:50.641 align:start position:0%
unanimous agreement on that first
 
04:33:52.250 --> 04:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
statement I said that a new article 5
 
04:33:53.929 --> 04:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
convention call in this case for term
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
limits limited to a specific subject
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
cannot possibly lead to a convention on
 
04:34:03.410 --> 04:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.010 --> 04:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your additional uh
 
04:34:15.170 --> 04:34:15.180 align:start position:0%

welcome

limits I can't I wish I could move the
 
04:34:41.090 --> 04:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
speaker because I can't see you in the
 
04:34:41.100 --> 04:34:42.170 align:start position:0%
speaker because I can't see you in the
corner

04:34:42.170 --> 04:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
corner
 
04:34:42.180 --> 04:34:43.910 align:start position:0%
corner
okay

04:34:43.910 --> 04:34:43.920 align:start position:0%

um now from Bridgton Maine and we have

been working on putting terminals on

Congress since the 1990s I want to give
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of history about this
 
04:34:55.789 --> 04:34:55.799 align:start position:0%
because it's something that is the most
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
popular reform in the country today A
 
04:35:01.730 --> 04:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
poll was taken last year 82 percent of
 
04:35:03.590 --> 04:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
the American people support term limits
 
04:35:06.349 --> 04:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
for congress and this is a non-partisan
 
04:35:08.570 --> 04:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
those numbers break out at 87 percent
 
04:35:11.689 --> 04:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
Republicans 83 percent Democrats and 78
 
04:35:15.010 --> 04:35:15.020 align:start position:0%
percent Independents back in the 1990s
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
23 States passed laws putting term
 
04:35:20.689 --> 04:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
limits on their own Congressional
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
delegations New Hampshire was one of the
 
04:35:25.849 --> 04:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
23 most of those States the people did
 
04:35:27.650 --> 04:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
it at The Ballot Box approved it by
 
04:35:29.689 --> 04:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
voting for it here in New Hampshire the
 
04:35:31.789 --> 04:35:31.799 align:start position:0%
legislature passed the law it passed
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
unanimously in the Senate
 
04:35:35.929 --> 04:35:35.939 align:start position:0%
unfortunately what happened was the law
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
got challenged in Arkansas went all the
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
way to the U.S Supreme Court
 
04:35:43.131 --> 04:35:43.141 align:start position:0%
and in the case against our organization
 
04:35:46.250 --> 04:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
U.S term limits versus Thornton the U.S
 
04:35:48.051 --> 04:35:48.061 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruled that the only way
 
04:35:50.209 --> 04:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
term limits can be imposed upon members
 
04:35:53.090 --> 04:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
of Congress was via Article 5 the
 
04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
amending provision
 
04:35:57.051 --> 04:35:57.061 align:start position:0%
now I'm not going to waste your time
 
04:35:59.150 --> 04:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
reading Article Five you know it by
 
04:36:01.551 --> 04:36:01.561 align:start position:0%
heart there's only two ways to propose
 
04:36:04.670 --> 04:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
amendments I don't have a lot of faith
 
04:36:07.609 --> 04:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
that Congress will propose
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
term limits on themselves by the
 
04:36:11.750 --> 04:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
two-thirds needed I think we all can
 
04:36:13.131 --> 04:36:13.141 align:start position:0%
agree on that
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
that is why we are seeking to have you
 
04:36:18.109 --> 04:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
the state legislatures do it to them
 
04:36:20.810 --> 04:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
without their consent that is the beauty
 
04:36:23.090 --> 04:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
of the article 5 convention
 
04:36:25.730 --> 04:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
the framers in their wisdom understood
 
04:36:27.709 --> 04:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
that the states would need a check
 
04:36:30.529 --> 04:36:30.539 align:start position:0%
against a unresponsive federal
 
04:36:30.539 --> 04:36:31.789 align:start position:0%
against a unresponsive federal
government

04:36:31.789 --> 04:36:31.799 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
the American people are sick and tired
 
04:36:36.890 --> 04:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
of the unresponsive Congress that we
 
04:36:36.900 --> 04:36:38.929 align:start position:0%
of the unresponsive Congress that we
have

04:36:38.929 --> 04:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:36:41.209 --> 04:36:41.219 align:start position:0%
the polling the approval rating of
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
Congress has been below 20 percent for
 
04:36:47.209 --> 04:36:47.219 align:start position:0%
decades and yet the re-election rate is
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
over 95 percent
 
04:36:53.810 --> 04:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
now I'm from Maine I would not waste a
 
04:36:57.529 --> 04:36:57.539 align:start position:0%
dime in a one-star hotel for an evening
 
04:37:01.789 --> 04:37:01.799 align:start position:0%
in Concord why are we settling for a
 
04:37:06.769 --> 04:37:06.779 align:start position:0%
permanent less than a one-star Congress
 
04:37:09.410 --> 04:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
enough is enough
 
04:37:11.810 --> 04:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
Washington DC is broken
 
04:37:14.510 --> 04:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
now term limits is not the Silver Bullet
 
04:37:17.209 --> 04:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
but it is a good star in the right
 
04:37:17.219 --> 04:37:19.189 align:start position:0%
but it is a good star in the right
direction

04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
direction
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
the people that control what's happening
 
04:37:22.970 --> 04:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
to our lives
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
have been in Congress for decades
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
yes we send some good people down there
 
04:37:32.090 --> 04:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
but you all know how the system works
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
they go down with good intentions
 
04:37:36.349 --> 04:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
and they get trapped
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
I like to reference the Borg from Star
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
Trek they get assimilated into that Borg
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
and they become part of the problem
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
now we need to help them out
 
04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
we need to break the structure up
 
04:37:53.090 --> 04:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
we cannot change it at The Ballot Box we
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
can't vote for this now
 
04:37:56.449 --> 04:37:56.459 align:start position:0%
Court won't let us
 
04:37:58.910 --> 04:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
it is up to you
 
04:38:01.010 --> 04:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
it is up to you and what the framers
 
04:38:04.250 --> 04:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
gave you the power under article 5.
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:10.670 --> 04:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
since 1789
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
Congress has not proposed now let me
 
04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
back up we have 27 amendments to the U.S
 
04:38:15.600 --> 04:38:16.730 align:start position:0%
back up we have 27 amendments to the U.S
Constitution

04:38:16.730 --> 04:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
Congress has proposed 33 so that means
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
six were never ratified
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
but they have introduced over 12
 
04:38:26.209 --> 04:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
000 amendments to the Constitution
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand
 
04:38:31.849 --> 04:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
the last Congress the 117th
 
04:38:34.369 --> 04:38:34.379 align:start position:0%
they introduced 70 amendments to the U.S
 
04:38:34.379 --> 04:38:36.170 align:start position:0%
they introduced 70 amendments to the U.S
Constitution

04:38:36.170 --> 04:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
04:38:38.750 --> 04:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
this 118th Congress in the first two
 
04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
weeks of session have introduced 15
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
amendments to the U.S Constitution under
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
article 5.
 
04:38:46.970 --> 04:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
some of these are great amendments
 
04:38:49.970 --> 04:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
there's several termite amendments
 
04:38:52.849 --> 04:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
now good ideas don't come from
 
04:38:55.250 --> 04:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
Washington folks they go into a pile
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
like my presentation sits there and
 
04:39:00.890 --> 04:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
collects dust
 
04:39:00.900 --> 04:39:02.230 align:start position:0%
collects dust
forever

04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
forever
 
04:39:05.570 --> 04:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
now the same history since 1789 take a
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
guess how many amendments the states
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
that has equal Authority with Congress
 
04:39:12.051 --> 04:39:12.061 align:start position:0%
to propose amendments take a guess how
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
many amendments they have introduced
 
04:39:14.760 --> 04:39:16.310 align:start position:0%
many amendments they have introduced
zero

04:39:16.310 --> 04:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
zero
 
04:39:18.769 --> 04:39:18.779 align:start position:0%
not a single amendment by the state
 
04:39:20.570 --> 04:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
legislatures have ever been introduced
 
04:39:22.609 --> 04:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
under article 5.
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
and we wonder why there's a problem
 
04:39:29.330 --> 04:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
it is time that the states use the
 
04:39:32.929 --> 04:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
mechanism now this amendment
 
04:39:34.490 --> 04:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
the chairman mentioned that we have done
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
this before we have the 22nd Amendment
 
04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
of a terminals for that president
 
04:39:43.010 --> 04:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
you know uh Thomas James Madison wrote a
 
04:39:45.050 --> 04:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
he sent the Constitution to Thomas
 
04:39:46.970 --> 04:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
Jefferson after it was adopted he I
 
04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
think he was in uh France at the time
 
04:39:51.770 --> 04:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
and Jefferson wrote back to him and said
 
04:39:53.448 --> 04:39:53.458 align:start position:0%
hey here's what I like about it but
 
04:39:55.550 --> 04:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's two things I hate about it
 
04:39:58.250 --> 04:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
you did not include a Bill of Rights and
 
04:39:59.930 --> 04:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
you did not include term limits they
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
used to call it rotation of office
 
04:40:06.170 --> 04:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
for the president and for the Senate
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
now Mr Jefferson
 
04:40:10.010 --> 04:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
shortly after he got his Bill of Rights
 
04:40:12.350 --> 04:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
and we finally got term limits on the
 
04:40:14.690 --> 04:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
president a couple hundred years later
 
04:40:16.850 --> 04:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
but he was a strong advocate for terms
 
04:40:18.530 --> 04:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
on the Senate
 
04:40:20.330 --> 04:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
so my
 
04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
encouragement to you today is that New
 
04:40:23.520 --> 04:40:24.770 align:start position:0%
encouragement to you today is that New
Hampshire

04:40:24.770 --> 04:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:40:27.230 --> 04:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
should be leading this charge in in my
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
presentation I hope you can spend some
 
04:40:32.810 --> 04:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
time I sent this to you in a PDF
 
04:40:34.430 --> 04:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of misinformation you're
 
04:40:37.368 --> 04:40:37.378 align:start position:0%
receiving it's all nonsense
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
we have such experience with conventions
 
04:40:44.750 --> 04:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire has the most experience
 
04:40:46.250 --> 04:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
of all the states
 
04:40:48.530 --> 04:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
when it comes to a convention to adopt
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
either a new Constitution or a
 
04:40:53.570 --> 04:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
convention to propose amendments
 
04:40:55.670 --> 04:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has held 17 such
 
04:40:58.190 --> 04:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
conventions two to adopt a new
 
04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution and 15 to propose
 
04:41:01.080 --> 04:41:02.270 align:start position:0%
Constitution and 15 to propose
amendments

04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
04:41:05.868 --> 04:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
they have proposed 243 amendments and
 
04:41:08.208 --> 04:41:08.218 align:start position:0%
adopted 145.
 
04:41:11.630 --> 04:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
so you are actually using this process
 
04:41:14.208 --> 04:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
you also using the process every year at
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
the uniform law commission you appoint
 
04:41:18.948 --> 04:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who meet with all 50 49
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
states to Draft Solutions it functions
 
04:41:25.788 --> 04:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
exactly as an article 5 convention in
 
04:41:27.410 --> 04:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
fact you have two bills before you this
 
04:41:29.208 --> 04:41:29.218 align:start position:0%
year that have come out of a Convention
 
04:41:30.530 --> 04:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
of states
 
04:41:33.288 --> 04:41:33.298 align:start position:0%
so this is not we know how to do this
 
04:41:36.410 --> 04:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
we're doing it every single year
 
04:41:39.890 --> 04:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
in fact this legislature sent delegates
 
04:41:42.110 --> 04:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
to an official Convention of States
 
04:41:44.750 --> 04:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
called by the legislature of Arizona in
 
04:41:47.810 --> 04:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
2017. that convention was called to
 
04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
Draft rules for an article 5 convention
 
04:41:52.190 --> 04:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I have the pictures of your
 
04:41:53.868 --> 04:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
delegates who went there from this
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and they drafted some great
 
04:41:58.970 --> 04:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
rules so we have rules
 
04:42:01.128 --> 04:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
we know how to do this we have the
 
04:42:03.970 --> 04:42:03.980 align:start position:0%
experience now we just need you to pass
 
04:42:07.610 --> 04:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
hcr4 so that we can get to the
 
04:42:09.170 --> 04:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
convention now I want to be a realist
 
04:42:11.090 --> 04:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
with you and I'll wrap things up Mr
 
04:42:14.448 --> 04:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
chairman you asked a question about
 
04:42:14.458 --> 04:42:15.410 align:start position:0%
chairman you asked a question about
um

04:42:15.410 --> 04:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:18.170 --> 04:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
would they put it on themselves term
 
04:42:21.530 --> 04:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I love it
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
this this breaks my heart to share with
 
04:42:26.628 --> 04:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
a committee okay let me tell you why I
 
04:42:29.208 --> 04:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
want to get to a convention
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
because an article 5 convention will be
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
a game changer for our country
 
04:42:36.410 --> 04:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
it will be a game changer for the states
 
04:42:38.090 --> 04:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
and for our legislatures because they
 
04:42:41.150 --> 04:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
will realize now we can make change at
 
04:42:43.490 --> 04:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
the federal level instead of depending
 
04:42:46.610 --> 04:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
on Congress to try to do it
 
04:42:46.620 --> 04:42:48.110 align:start position:0%
on Congress to try to do it
but

04:42:48.110 --> 04:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:42:50.448 --> 04:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
my Common Sense tells me this
 
04:42:52.670 --> 04:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
because it's happened in the past
 
04:42:54.830 --> 04:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
as we get closer
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
to having this convention in our
 
04:42:59.090 --> 04:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
convention is the most limited
 
04:43:01.970 --> 04:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
convention you can call we it only you
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
can only change the number of terms of
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
the current senators and members of
 
04:43:10.610 --> 04:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
house that's it the number
 
04:43:13.610 --> 04:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
but what's going to happen is this
 
04:43:15.650 --> 04:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
do you really think they will ever let
 
04:43:17.930 --> 04:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
us get to a convention to impose
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
terminals on them of course not
 
04:43:21.708 --> 04:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
they're going to do what they've done in
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
the past
 
04:43:25.190 --> 04:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
they will propose an amendment for term
 
04:43:28.670 --> 04:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
limits and guess what Mr chairman they
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
will grandfather themselves so it
 
04:43:33.288 --> 04:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect any of them
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
because they would rather protect
 
04:43:34.798 --> 04:43:36.230 align:start position:0%
because they would rather protect
themselves

04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
then let you
 
04:43:40.788 --> 04:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
try to clear house
 
04:43:43.010 --> 04:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
the next year after ratification of that
 
04:43:44.990 --> 04:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment because the states would put
 
04:43:46.368 --> 04:43:46.378 align:start position:0%
together a much better Amendment than
 
04:43:48.288 --> 04:43:48.298 align:start position:0%
Congress would put together
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
but sadly our reality and the truth will
 
04:43:52.610 --> 04:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
probably be they will do it
 
04:43:54.770 --> 04:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
but here's my dream
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
they do that
 
04:43:59.330 --> 04:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
and the people get fed up and see behind
 
04:44:03.288 --> 04:44:03.298 align:start position:0%
it and we still get to 34. and we get
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
our Amendment proposed and we have a
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
dueling process of two amendments I
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
think the state Amendment will get
 
04:44:13.550 --> 04:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
ratified before congresses so with that
 
04:44:15.530 --> 04:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
I will close I will take any questions I
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
want to just encourage you to please
 
04:44:18.010 --> 04:44:18.020 align:start position:0%
vote for
 
04:44:18.020 --> 04:44:19.570 align:start position:0%
vote for
HCS

04:44:19.570 --> 04:44:19.580 align:start position:0%
HCS
 
04:44:22.368 --> 04:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
hcr4 there we go fraternal limits on
 
04:44:24.288 --> 04:44:24.298 align:start position:0%
Congress thank you
 
04:44:28.310 --> 04:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Quinn uh Russell Finney
 
04:44:29.930 --> 04:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you you said you would take
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions I would love to take there's a
 
04:44:34.010 --> 04:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
question here yes so
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
um it's good to see you again I can't
 
04:44:37.368 --> 04:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
think as you're not thank you for being
 
04:44:39.948 --> 04:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
here my my question is is uh maybe a
 
04:44:41.830 --> 04:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
little complicated because
 
04:44:44.330 --> 04:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
right now in our in our current you know
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
social and political climate we're
 
04:44:48.288 --> 04:44:48.298 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of upheaval and
 
04:44:50.750 --> 04:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
on this issue specifically but what
 
04:44:52.670 --> 04:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
we're not mentioning is the the hyper
 
04:44:54.530 --> 04:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
partisan ideologies that are starting to
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
to creep in the you know to the body
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
politic how do we
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
how do we impose term limits without
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
talking about the issue of a
 
04:45:06.110 --> 04:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
partisanship how do we make this a
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan issue completely so that
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
we're not voting for parties we're
 
04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
voting for people and policies because
 
04:45:14.330 --> 04:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
that's the real issue is that you know
 
04:45:16.010 --> 04:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
people are are staying in office even
 
04:45:17.690 --> 04:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
though you know Congress sucks they're
 
04:45:19.310 --> 04:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
staying in office because their party is
 
04:45:21.530 --> 04:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
in office how do we change that
 
04:45:23.750 --> 04:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
well that's the beauty of this this
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
issue term limits because it's
 
04:45:27.470 --> 04:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
completely nonpartisan all it provides
 
04:45:29.690 --> 04:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
is an open seat where anybody can run
 
04:45:31.490 --> 04:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
for office and what I see about with
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
term limits
 
04:45:35.208 --> 04:45:35.218 align:start position:0%
I do see an opportunity for people
 
04:45:37.070 --> 04:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
outside of the two-party system to
 
04:45:38.690 --> 04:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
actually win some seats because right
 
04:45:40.190 --> 04:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
now they can't
 
04:45:43.010 --> 04:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
the the way the system is rigged is that
 
04:45:45.530 --> 04:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
97 of corporate Pac money goes to the
 
04:45:48.170 --> 04:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
incumbents all right the parties on both
 
04:45:48.180 --> 04:45:49.850 align:start position:0%
incumbents all right the parties on both
sides

04:45:49.850 --> 04:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
sides
 
04:45:51.650 --> 04:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
any Challenger that tries to run against
 
04:45:53.110 --> 04:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
incumbent you know what happens to them
 
04:45:55.250 --> 04:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
they don't last very long they're
 
04:45:57.288 --> 04:45:57.298 align:start position:0%
usually threatened out during the
 
04:45:59.690 --> 04:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
primary and this they they keep their
 
04:46:03.050 --> 04:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
their seats safe what open seat election
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
does it gives us fair and more
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
competitive elections only about 20
 
04:46:10.190 --> 04:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
percent of a congressional districts or
 
04:46:13.010 --> 04:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
even competitive today because so many
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
seats are so safe
 
04:46:19.128 --> 04:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
and we as voters I'm tired of voting for
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
the same person
 
04:46:24.890 --> 04:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
cycle after cycle after cycle we I want
 
04:46:27.410 --> 04:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
choices and when you have an open seat
 
04:46:29.330 --> 04:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
elections we have more people running
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
for office we have more people with
 
04:46:34.128 --> 04:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
different backgrounds participating in
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
our government that can bring some
 
04:46:39.170 --> 04:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
new eyes with some fresh ideas don't we
 
04:46:40.788 --> 04:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
need that in Congress right now some
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
fresh ideas
 
04:46:46.010 --> 04:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
same old same old is getting us same old
 
04:46:47.330 --> 04:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
same old
 
04:46:49.430 --> 04:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
and that's what terminals will help to
 
04:46:53.390 --> 04:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
this party problem that we seem to have
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
with the country today on both sides I'm
 
04:46:59.150 --> 04:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
so sick of it
 
04:47:01.850 --> 04:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr Quinn yes
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative O'Neill
 
04:47:06.530 --> 04:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:08.330 --> 04:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
um so I don't disagree with you on many
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the issues that you're reciting about
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
Congress today I think probably all of
 
04:47:13.368 --> 04:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
us would
 
04:47:15.650 --> 04:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
um but my question for you is you know
 
04:47:17.330 --> 04:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the corporate Pac money
 
04:47:19.850 --> 04:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
going to incumbents
 
04:47:22.070 --> 04:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
um I see the bigger problem as the money
 
04:47:24.910 --> 04:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't you think that this type of
 
04:47:27.170 --> 04:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
solution to the problem as opposed to
 
04:47:28.490 --> 04:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
trying to overturn something like
 
04:47:30.650 --> 04:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
citizens united is going to get at that
 
04:47:32.030 --> 04:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
problem or is that money just going to
 
04:47:33.708 --> 04:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
go to the next person they cherry pick
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
to run for office yeah there's some this
 
04:47:37.490 --> 04:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
is what's great about term limits term
 
04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
limits is actually a form of campaign
 
04:47:41.330 --> 04:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
Finance reform because of that money
 
04:47:43.610 --> 04:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
that goes the incumbents now when you
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
have so many new people running
 
04:47:48.288 --> 04:47:48.298 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't like to discredit
 
04:47:50.690 --> 04:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
people but we know how Congress works
 
04:47:53.330 --> 04:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
once they have a legislator down in DC
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
for a while they become very tight with
 
04:47:56.930 --> 04:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists the special interest
 
04:47:56.940 --> 04:47:58.128 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists the special interest
groups

04:47:58.128 --> 04:47:58.138 align:start position:0%
groups
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I hate to say it but they're kind of
 
04:48:01.440 --> 04:48:03.170 align:start position:0%
and I hate to say it but they're kind of
owned

04:48:03.170 --> 04:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
owned
 
04:48:05.150 --> 04:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's just just reality
 
04:48:07.850 --> 04:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
what this will do is
 
04:48:11.288 --> 04:48:11.298 align:start position:0%
now when somebody runs for office
 
04:48:13.788 --> 04:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
that money's not going to flow so easily
 
04:48:15.650 --> 04:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
because now they they don't know who
 
04:48:17.448 --> 04:48:17.458 align:start position:0%
they're betting on
 
04:48:19.970 --> 04:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
and the beauty of this is these
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
individuals will not be able to stay
 
04:48:23.390 --> 04:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
there for decades and so it's going to
 
04:48:26.208 --> 04:48:26.218 align:start position:0%
be just think about this way wave after
 
04:48:29.448 --> 04:48:29.458 align:start position:0%
wave of new people showing up
 
04:48:32.690 --> 04:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
in Washington DC election after election
 
04:48:35.690 --> 04:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
it tends to reduce the amount of money
 
04:48:37.850 --> 04:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
that's going to protect the incumbents
 
04:48:39.470 --> 04:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
that is the power of this whole thing
 
04:48:41.628 --> 04:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
it's a structural change
 
04:48:44.208 --> 04:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
we also have seen studies where the
 
04:48:47.810 --> 04:48:47.820 align:start position:0%
spending in Washington is is much less
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
once they're there typically after their
 
04:48:52.730 --> 04:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
third term in the house they start that
 
04:48:55.250 --> 04:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
wallet tends to be much wider
 
04:48:57.948 --> 04:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
and the spending gets out of control
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
whereas new people don't spend as much
 
04:49:01.850 --> 04:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
money because they want to learn where
 
04:49:03.050 --> 04:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
is this money going they're a little
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
more responsible with our money
 
04:49:10.128 --> 04:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
and so when it comes to Financial
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility on both the
 
04:49:14.810 --> 04:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
election end of it and
 
04:49:17.270 --> 04:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
government spending term limits will go
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
a long way to helping get us in the
 
04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
04:49:26.090 --> 04:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
I actually wanted to add on to her Point
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
what is there any Fail-Safe to where
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
this process wouldn't just become
 
04:49:34.970 --> 04:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
corrupt within itself
 
04:49:37.610 --> 04:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm just stating due to Citizens
 
04:49:40.490 --> 04:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
United you know we you don't have to
 
04:49:43.128 --> 04:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
know where money comes from so say
 
04:49:46.490 --> 04:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
picking the delegates by each state
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
um who's to say that the people in
 
04:49:50.090 --> 04:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
office we're not going to get money
 
04:49:52.850 --> 04:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
thrown at us or you know things thrown
 
04:49:55.610 --> 04:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
at us for picking the right delegates to
 
04:49:55.620 --> 04:49:56.810 align:start position:0%
at us for picking the right delegates to
go

04:49:56.810 --> 04:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:49:59.628 --> 04:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
from our state to this convention
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
it seemed to be a revolving door unless
 
04:50:05.690 --> 04:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
solving a court problem well the um the
 
04:50:08.330 --> 04:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
beauty of the article 5 process is now
 
04:50:10.610 --> 04:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you individuals
 
04:50:13.250 --> 04:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
and more than likely most of the
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
delegates that are sent will be state
 
04:50:14.638 --> 04:50:16.430 align:start position:0%
delegates that are sent will be state
legislators

04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:26.150 --> 04:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
multi-millionaires will be buying off
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
people who are just going to spend
 
04:50:28.850 --> 04:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
probably a week together in a meeting
 
04:50:31.208 --> 04:50:31.218 align:start position:0%
pass an amendment and send it back out
 
04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know this and the other thing is
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's why you're looking at a delegate
 
04:50:36.530 --> 04:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
limitation Act as well because there's
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
going to be consequences
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
there is also the
 
04:50:45.050 --> 04:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
The Pledge system of a commission when
 
04:50:47.090 --> 04:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
you appoint as a legislature they are
 
04:50:49.368 --> 04:50:49.378 align:start position:0%
legally bound already when you appoint
 
04:50:50.990 --> 04:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
your delegates let's say New Hampshire
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
sends seven delegates it's one state one
 
04:50:54.890 --> 04:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
vote so it doesn't matter how many you
 
04:50:54.900 --> 04:50:55.910 align:start position:0%
vote so it doesn't matter how many you
send

04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
send
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
they that delegation is bound to their
 
04:50:58.680 --> 04:50:59.750 align:start position:0%
they that delegation is bound to their
Commission

04:50:59.750 --> 04:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:51:01.250 --> 04:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
and so they can't violate their
 
04:51:03.050 --> 04:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
commission they can't change anything
 
04:51:04.610 --> 04:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
that takes place down there they can't
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
change the subject matter they can only
 
04:51:09.650 --> 04:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
go and vote on the amendment for term
 
04:51:12.050 --> 04:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
limits now you can also bind them how
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
you want them to vote as a legislature
 
04:51:15.530 --> 04:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
if you don't want tournaments then you
 
04:51:17.208 --> 04:51:17.218 align:start position:0%
can bind them that way I would not
 
04:51:18.770 --> 04:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
recommend that if you want to stay in
 
04:51:21.050 --> 04:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
office for very long because I don't
 
04:51:22.490 --> 04:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
think your constituents would be very
 
04:51:24.650 --> 04:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
happy if you prevented term limits in
 
04:51:26.570 --> 04:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
Congress so
 
04:51:29.150 --> 04:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of safeguards in regard
 
04:51:31.550 --> 04:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
and that's one thing that I I tend to
 
04:51:35.810 --> 04:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
feel I have more faith in people today
 
04:51:39.050 --> 04:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
I I trust what you folks do
 
04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
I I believe that we can you're doing it
 
04:51:43.250 --> 04:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
already with you doing it with the
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission you're appointing
 
04:51:46.850 --> 04:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
people they're coming back with
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
solutions that they
 
04:51:52.128 --> 04:51:52.138 align:start position:0%
thought of drafted debated worked on and
 
04:51:52.910 --> 04:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
they're coming back and they're
 
04:51:54.410 --> 04:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
presenting them to you
 
04:51:58.310 --> 04:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
so they're not corrupted by anything
 
04:52:00.170 --> 04:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
like that and this is state law it's a
 
04:52:02.208 --> 04:52:02.218 align:start position:0%
lot easier to get one state law passed
 
04:52:03.650 --> 04:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
than it is an amendment to the US
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution that requires three
 
04:52:07.368 --> 04:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
quarters of the state legislatures or or
 
04:52:10.010 --> 04:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the conventions so if
 
04:52:11.090 --> 04:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of corruption
 
04:52:13.310 --> 04:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
it'd be more of a microcosm convention
 
04:52:13.320 --> 04:52:14.448 align:start position:0%
it'd be more of a microcosm convention
process

04:52:14.448 --> 04:52:14.458 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:52:17.448 --> 04:52:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.368 --> 04:52:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:24.770 --> 04:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
sing on thank you for your testimony for
 
04:52:26.330 --> 04:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
being here
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
a personal note I don't know how any of
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
these measures will play out obviously
 
04:52:32.868 --> 04:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
we're early in the process but I think
 
04:52:34.070 --> 04:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's healthy
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think people watching in
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
following this will inevitably learn
 
04:52:40.970 --> 04:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
something about our processes and our
 
04:52:43.190 --> 04:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
history and our government and so that
 
04:52:46.010 --> 04:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
is just a plus I think
 
04:52:47.930 --> 04:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
um that's is there anyone else who wants
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
to speak to this measure uh yes sir uh
 
04:52:57.288 --> 04:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:57.298 --> 04:53:13.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:53:13.250 --> 04:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:17.330 --> 04:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
we have a measure in front of us
 
04:53:19.730 --> 04:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
um but as you were following up on my
 
04:53:21.948 --> 04:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
point about understanding Civics
 
04:53:23.868 --> 04:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
um who did you want to have take a
 
04:53:29.330 --> 04:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:31.788 --> 04:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
could you take uh one to two minutes
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
because that that is a good question for
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
whoever's listening or watching to
 
04:53:38.030 --> 04:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
clarify the difference between a con car
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
and a constitutional convention can you
 
04:53:41.810 --> 04:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
do that in a minute or so yes I can and
 
04:53:44.390 --> 04:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh all this information is in the PDF I
 
04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
sent the committee members
 
04:53:49.490 --> 04:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
the terminology con con is kind of a
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
derogatory phrase it means
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention and the
 
04:53:57.230 --> 04:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
opponents to an article 5 convention in
 
04:53:59.330 --> 04:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
Article 5 conventions a convention for
 
04:54:01.730 --> 04:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
proposing amendments that the states
 
04:54:03.050 --> 04:54:03.060 align:start position:0%
apply for
 
04:54:05.810 --> 04:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
a constitutional a true Constitutional
 
04:54:05.820 --> 04:54:07.070 align:start position:0%
a constitutional a true Constitutional
Convention

04:54:07.070 --> 04:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
Convention
 
04:54:10.310 --> 04:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
can is called to adopt a new
 
04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
constitution completely different
 
04:54:15.530 --> 04:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
entities in fact James Madison writes
 
04:54:18.170 --> 04:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
about the two in federals 85 if you're
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
watching read federals 85 Alexander
 
04:54:24.590 --> 04:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
Hamilton's explains the differences
 
04:54:26.570 --> 04:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
a constitutional convention requires
 
04:54:29.390 --> 04:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent to call it requires
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent to pass in the
 
04:54:34.010 --> 04:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
convention and is unanimous consent to
 
04:54:35.810 --> 04:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
ratify to the for the states that will
 
04:54:38.270 --> 04:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
be bound to it and Article 5 takes
 
04:54:41.810 --> 04:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
two-thirds to call a simple majority to
 
04:54:45.470 --> 04:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
pass and three quarters to ratify and it
 
04:54:48.550 --> 04:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
binds all 50 states completely different
 
04:54:52.970 --> 04:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
James Madison uh addresses this in his
 
04:54:55.970 --> 04:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
letter to George Turbeville which your
 
04:54:58.128 --> 04:54:58.138 align:start position:0%
the opponents are sending you a quote by
 
04:55:01.250 --> 04:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
Madison that he feared he trembled at a
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
second convention if you read the letter
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
he explains the two differences of these
 
04:55:08.810 --> 04:55:08.820 align:start position:0%
conventions he did not fear an article 5
 
04:55:11.448 --> 04:55:11.458 align:start position:0%
convention what he feared at that time
 
04:55:14.690 --> 04:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
was redoing what he had just got done
 
04:55:17.930 --> 04:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
and read making an entirely new
 
04:55:20.390 --> 04:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution that is what he was
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
trembling about he didn't want to go
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
through that again because they just
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
could they couldn't do any better than
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
04:55:28.490 --> 04:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
he's not referring to an article 5
 
04:55:28.500 --> 04:55:31.368 align:start position:0%
he's not referring to an article 5
convention

04:55:31.368 --> 04:55:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:33.350 --> 04:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that quick civics lesson
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
that'll be on YouTube Forever for
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
whoever watches these things and uh is
 
04:55:40.368 --> 04:55:40.378 align:start position:0%
an old Civics teacher I appreciate you
 
04:55:42.170 --> 04:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
taking that extra minute any other
 
04:55:44.628 --> 04:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
comments on this or anyone wish to speak
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
to this measure
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
not saying any we will close this
 
04:55:52.250 --> 04:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
hearing and in three minutes we're due
 
04:55:55.390 --> 04:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
to take up another uh measure which is
 
04:55:58.448 --> 04:55:58.458 align:start position:0%
hcr5 I do want to say uh to the members
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
that I have spoken with and communicated
 
04:56:04.610 --> 04:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
with the ranking member and we may have
 
04:56:07.250 --> 04:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
a break depending upon how long this
 
04:56:08.930 --> 04:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
next measure takes with 45 minutes
 
04:56:10.730 --> 04:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
alloted to it if we don't use all that
 
04:56:15.288 --> 04:56:15.298 align:start position:0%
time we may try to exec one or two bills
 
04:56:18.350 --> 04:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
that uh the ranking member and I have uh
 
04:56:21.110 --> 04:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
have flagged is some measures that we
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
may be able to exec so just uh in FYI I
 
04:56:26.810 --> 04:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
know not everybody can stay here but if
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
we have a quorum standby we may try to
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
exec a couple bills before we finish
 
04:56:35.270 --> 04:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh this afternoon
 
04:56:39.110 --> 04:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh inform let me ask if the prime
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor for hcr5 that would be
 
04:56:45.770 --> 04:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kaplan is
 
04:56:48.050 --> 04:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan
 
04:56:50.270 --> 04:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
in the house I I'm not seeing a whole
 
04:56:55.128 --> 04:56:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:58.610 --> 04:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
and representative cat so anyone here uh

that would be
 
04:57:03.298 --> 04:57:08.090 align:start position:0%
that would be
hcr5

04:57:08.090 --> 04:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:11.030 --> 04:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
which urges appropriate legal action
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
against multinational fossil fuel
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
companies for harms incurred from
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
disinformation campaigns about the
 
04:57:23.208 --> 04:57:23.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:26.510 --> 04:57:26.520 align:start position:0%

Prime sponsor for hcr5 uh welcome and uh
 
04:59:36.110 --> 04:59:36.120 align:start position:0%

committee
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
I know you all would agree that uh
 
04:59:44.810 --> 04:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
thankfully we live in a nation under the
 
04:59:47.090 --> 04:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
rule of law designed to protect the
 
04:59:49.070 --> 04:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
interests of individuals and of our
 
04:59:51.410 --> 04:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
institutions and Society
 
04:59:53.810 --> 04:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
one of the basic tenets of the law from
 
04:59:55.910 --> 04:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hammurabi down to English common law and
 
04:59:58.430 --> 04:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
the drafting of our constitution
 
05:00:00.170 --> 05:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
is that injured parties have the right
 
05:00:02.510 --> 05:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
to seek redress of their Grievances and
 
05:00:04.250 --> 05:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
the damages which have been inflicted
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
upon them by the actions of others
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
under the capitalist system we enjoy
 
05:00:11.090 --> 05:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
that includes the right to redress from
 
05:00:13.368 --> 05:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
the actions of private corporations in
 
05:00:15.530 --> 05:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
cases when they have operated under the
 
05:00:17.690 --> 05:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
cloak of corporate anonymity to defraud
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
and perpetrate crimes against an
 
05:00:22.430 --> 05:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
unwitting public
 
05:00:24.288 --> 05:00:24.298 align:start position:0%
cases brought against corporations for
 
05:00:25.850 --> 05:00:25.860 align:start position:0%
fraudulent actions that result in
 
05:00:28.610 --> 05:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
Damages are difficult and often drawn
 
05:00:28.620 --> 05:00:29.330 align:start position:0%
Damages are difficult and often drawn
out

05:00:29.330 --> 05:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:00:31.730 --> 05:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
Affairs that take place and culminate
 
05:00:33.948 --> 05:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
only after a long period of years
 
05:00:35.570 --> 05:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
Corporation is the most powerful
 
05:00:38.030 --> 05:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
especially may have immense powers of
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
purse and influence to wield when they
 
05:00:42.470 --> 05:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
are under public scrutiny
 
05:00:44.150 --> 05:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
for example the so-called Master
 
05:00:45.948 --> 05:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement in favor of the
 
05:00:47.868 --> 05:00:47.878 align:start position:0%
attorney's general of 46 States against
 
05:00:49.970 --> 05:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
the four largest tobacco companies in
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
1998 was a product of a legal process
 
05:00:55.368 --> 05:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
that began in the 1950s when reports
 
05:00:57.650 --> 05:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
began to be published linking tobacco
 
05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
use to cancer
 
05:01:01.128 --> 05:01:01.138 align:start position:0%
and individual acquaintance began
 
05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
unsuccessfully to bring suits in the
 
05:01:05.390 --> 05:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
courts against the tobacco industry the
 
05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
efforts of the tobacco industry to
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
defend against these actions included
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
casting doubt on the science
 
05:01:14.868 --> 05:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
which I concluded without a doubt that
 
05:01:16.490 --> 05:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
the use of tobacco was linked to
 
05:01:18.530 --> 05:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
increased prevalence of lung and heart
 
05:01:18.540 --> 05:01:20.570 align:start position:0%
increased prevalence of lung and heart
damage

05:01:20.570 --> 05:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
damage
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
more recently New Hampshire was the
 
05:01:25.070 --> 05:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
beneficiary in 2017 of a settlement
 
05:01:25.080 --> 05:01:26.150 align:start position:0%
beneficiary in 2017 of a settlement
between

05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:01:27.650 --> 05:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
the U.S Department of Justice and
 
05:01:30.170 --> 05:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen where 15 billion dollars for
 
05:01:32.448 --> 05:01:32.458 align:start position:0%
knowingly violating the Clean Air Act by
 
05:01:34.730 --> 05:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
placing software designed to cheat on
 
05:01:38.330 --> 05:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
emissions let tests in their automobiles
 
05:01:41.150 --> 05:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
this bill hdr5 considers the actions of
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
major fossil fuel companies in enacting
 
05:01:45.530 --> 05:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
a campaign of disinformation over the
 
05:01:47.930 --> 05:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
last 30 years lying about the
 
05:01:49.910 --> 05:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
destabiling globally catastrophic
 
05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
results of the use of their products on
 
05:01:53.930 --> 05:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
the climate system we have depended on
 
05:01:55.490 --> 05:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
for all of human history
 
05:01:57.530 --> 05:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
when they knew the truth was the exact
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
opposite of what their public
 
05:02:00.830 --> 05:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
pronouncements and the pronouncements of
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
the institutions they funded were saying
 
05:02:05.510 --> 05:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
and are still saying today
 
05:02:07.250 --> 05:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
the science of climate change is not new
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
in 1859 the Irish physicist John Tyndall
 
05:02:12.830 --> 05:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
first wrote about the greenhouse effect
 
05:02:15.288 --> 05:02:15.298 align:start position:0%
which underpins the science of climate
 
05:02:17.750 --> 05:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
change namely the way in which so-called
 
05:02:19.250 --> 05:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases
 
05:02:21.530 --> 05:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
including carbon dioxide trap heat in
 
05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
the Earth's atmosphere in just the way a
 
05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
pane of glass operates in a greenhouse
 
05:02:26.930 --> 05:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
or in your living room window if it
 
05:02:28.128 --> 05:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
faces South
 
05:02:31.010 --> 05:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
by trapping the heat of the Sun
 
05:02:33.410 --> 05:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
Dr James Hansen of NASA's Goddard

the last two thousand years
 
05:03:59.690 --> 05:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
long before Dr Hansen testified to the
 
05:04:01.970 --> 05:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
Senate we now know due to investigative
 
05:04:04.550 --> 05:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
journalism that scientists hired by the
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
oil industry in the 1970s had already
 
05:04:09.770 --> 05:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
drawn similar conclusions and heeding

world's climate system
 
05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
but instead of coming clean and agreeing
 
05:04:24.770 --> 05:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
with Dr Hansen in 1988 that there was a
 
05:04:27.050 --> 05:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
problem that needed fixing the major oil
 
05:04:29.150 --> 05:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
companies pivoted to a campaign of
 
05:04:30.910 --> 05:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
denial and doubt about the science
 
05:04:33.050 --> 05:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
protecting their Investments and their
 
05:04:34.788 --> 05:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
shareholders instead of doing what they
 
05:04:37.910 --> 05:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
could to mitigate what they knew to be a
 
05:04:40.070 --> 05:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
possibly existential threat on a
 
05:04:42.288 --> 05:04:42.298 align:start position:0%
planetary scale if nothing was done to
 
05:04:45.590 --> 05:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
curb the combustion of oil and gas
 
05:04:47.570 --> 05:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
the impacts of this influence campaign
 
05:04:49.368 --> 05:04:49.378 align:start position:0%
have been astoundingly successful for
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
the oil companies but tragic for the
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
rest of us
 
05:04:55.190 --> 05:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
while the ipcc and the consensus of
 
05:04:57.050 --> 05:04:57.060 align:start position:0%

alarm
 
05:05:00.410 --> 05:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
for 30 years the fossil fuel companies
 
05:05:02.390 --> 05:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
carried out a denial deception and
 
05:05:04.128 --> 05:05:04.138 align:start position:0%
propaganda campaign
 
05:05:06.530 --> 05:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
so persuasive that to this day members
 
05:05:08.690 --> 05:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
of our political establishment failed to
 
05:05:11.448 --> 05:05:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
climate science and in the halls of our

05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
under the spell of the sophisticated
 
05:05:31.368 --> 05:05:31.378 align:start position:0%
public relations effort instead of
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
taking immediate action
 
05:05:35.090 --> 05:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
we have delayed joining the fight
 
05:05:36.830 --> 05:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
against climate change and the costs
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
associated with doing nothing have
 
05:05:41.208 --> 05:05:41.218 align:start position:0%

such an extreme crime
 
05:05:55.070 --> 05:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
that is the duty of the courts to decide
 
05:05:58.490 --> 05:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
our duty I suggest if we are to take our
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
charge seriously of looking out for the

interests of our constituents in the

we have several folks who would like to
 
05:06:44.270 --> 05:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
testify the list here all are in support
 
05:06:45.830 --> 05:06:45.840 align:start position:0%

05:07:00.770 --> 05:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
from uh from Portland Maine

the Senate Center for climate Integrity
 
05:07:07.190 --> 05:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
asked for seven minutes yes thank you
 
05:07:09.050 --> 05:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman and thank you all
 
05:07:11.628 --> 05:07:11.638 align:start position:0%
for for being here my name is Isla
 
05:07:12.770 --> 05:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
shorenstein and I'm the political
 
05:07:14.090 --> 05:07:14.100 align:start position:0%

Integrity we are a National Organization
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm not far I live in Portland Maine
 
05:07:22.490 --> 05:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to testify in support of
 
05:07:24.590 --> 05:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
Representative kaplan's resolution to

hold fossil fuel companies accountable
 
05:07:29.208 --> 05:07:29.218 align:start position:0%
for the harm they've knowingly caused so
 
05:07:30.530 --> 05:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
I just want to be very clear and lay
 
05:07:32.570 --> 05:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
some background climate change we know
 
05:07:34.368 --> 05:07:34.378 align:start position:0%
is harmful but it's also really
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
expensive according to the United States
 
05:07:38.810 --> 05:07:38.820 align:start position:0%

05:07:46.550 --> 05:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
quote heavy rainstorms are more frequent
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
and summers are hotter and drier sea
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
level is rising and severe storms cause
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
floods that damage property and
 
05:07:54.590 --> 05:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the coming decades the
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
changing climate is likely to increase
 
05:07:58.368 --> 05:07:58.378 align:start position:0%
flooding harm ecosystems and winter
 
05:08:01.250 --> 05:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
Recreation disrupt farming and increase
 
05:08:03.050 --> 05:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
some risk to human health which are
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
include heat related illnesses and
 
05:08:06.410 --> 05:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
vector-borne disease
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
this past summer New Hampshire received
 
05:08:10.430 --> 05:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
roughly half the normal amount of
 
05:08:12.530 --> 05:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
precipitation throwing the majority of
 
05:08:15.170 --> 05:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
the state into a rapid onset drought by
 
05:08:18.170 --> 05:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
August 3rd 65 Community water systems
 
05:08:20.510 --> 05:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
and six towns or cities had water
 
05:08:23.150 --> 05:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions in place and Farmers across
 
05:08:24.650 --> 05:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
the state were experiencing higher
 
05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
operational costs due to having diesel
 
05:08:28.850 --> 05:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
costs for pumping water and much lower
 
05:08:31.970 --> 05:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
yields so meanwhile the lead story in
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
the valley times yesterday was about how
 
05:08:35.690 --> 05:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
climate change is making New Hampshire
 
05:08:38.208 --> 05:08:38.218 align:start position:0%
Winters more mild and snow free although
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't know it today but this of
 
05:08:42.170 --> 05:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
course impacts winter tourism
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater supplies and agricultural
 
05:08:47.208 --> 05:08:47.218 align:start position:0%
cops crops like blueberries you know
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's late January and the majority of
 
05:08:50.208 --> 05:08:50.218 align:start position:0%
the state is only getting its first
 
05:08:53.690 --> 05:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
major snowstorm today or last night
 
05:08:55.368 --> 05:08:55.378 align:start position:0%
um but New Hampshire taxpayers are the
 
05:08:57.288 --> 05:08:57.298 align:start position:0%
ones that are facing greater and greater
 
05:08:59.448 --> 05:08:59.458 align:start position:0%
costs to respond to these disruptions
 
05:09:02.030 --> 05:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
both in terms of reactive measures like
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
disaster recovery and proactive measures
 
05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
like resilience and adaptation projects
 
05:09:09.410 --> 05:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
and since 2004 there have been about
 
05:09:11.868 --> 05:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
five extreme weather events in New
 
05:09:14.090 --> 05:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that cost 15 million dollars
 
05:09:16.970 --> 05:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
in Damages uh primarily due to flooding
 
05:09:20.330 --> 05:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
and Ice storms so the question that we
 
05:09:22.250 --> 05:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
can then ask is why should the fossil
 
05:09:24.170 --> 05:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
fuel industry be made to pay for some of
 
05:09:26.448 --> 05:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
these costs so there are two reasons
 
05:09:29.208 --> 05:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
number one uh because of the science it
 
05:09:31.070 --> 05:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
points us directly to a handful of
 
05:09:33.050 --> 05:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
specific companies that are to blame for
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
fueling the climate crisis
 
05:09:37.550 --> 05:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
and number two because a trove of
 
05:09:39.470 --> 05:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
internal industry documents that
 
05:09:41.208 --> 05:09:41.218 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan mentioned and
 
05:09:42.890 --> 05:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
other evidence show us that many of
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
these same companies had first-hand
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge about the harms their own
 
05:09:48.530 --> 05:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
products would cause and then
 
05:09:50.270 --> 05:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
deliberately lied about what they knew
 
05:09:52.670 --> 05:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
while selling and marketing these same
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
products to Consumers
 
05:09:56.930 --> 05:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
so I'll speak to the science first and
 
05:09:58.490 --> 05:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's important to remember that climate
 
05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
change didn't just happen on its own
 
05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
Studies have found that nearly
 
05:10:03.890 --> 05:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of all greenhouse gas
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
emissions since the beginning of the
 
05:10:08.090 --> 05:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
Industrial Revolution can be traced to
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
just 90 individual companies companies
 
05:10:14.510 --> 05:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
like Exxon Chevron shell BP Conoco
 
05:10:16.970 --> 05:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
Phillips and many many more so the
 
05:10:19.190 --> 05:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
science is crystal clear on this we are
 
05:10:21.470 --> 05:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
not all equally to blame for the
 
05:10:23.868 --> 05:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
Emergency that we find ourselves in
 
05:10:25.610 --> 05:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
but not only did the fossil fuel
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
industry perpetuate this crisis these
 
05:10:30.350 --> 05:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
same companies knew about the impact of
 
05:10:32.390 --> 05:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
burning fossil fuels and they knew this
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
over 60 years ago
 
05:10:36.230 --> 05:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of internal industry documents
 
05:10:38.208 --> 05:10:38.218 align:start position:0%
uncovered by journalists and researchers
 
05:10:40.430 --> 05:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
show that fossil fuel companies like
 
05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
Exxon knew decades ago that burning
 
05:10:44.930 --> 05:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels would raise global
 
05:10:46.730 --> 05:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
temperatures which would then have
 
05:10:49.850 --> 05:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
disastrous impacts worldwide by the 80s
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
they were predicting in their own words
 
05:10:54.770 --> 05:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
globally catastrophic effects
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
they even made specific projections
 
05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
about the east coast in a 1982 memo
 
05:11:01.610 --> 05:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
Exxon projected flooding up and down the
 
05:11:03.230 --> 05:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
Eastern Seaboard as New Hampshire
 
05:11:06.590 --> 05:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
Seacoast now experiences a 1988 shell
 
05:11:08.810 --> 05:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
memo details a number of projected
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
climate impacts including sea level rise
 
05:11:14.330 --> 05:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
local losses of food sources due to
 
05:11:16.250 --> 05:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
rising ocean temperatures natural
 
05:11:17.750 --> 05:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
resource damage because of ocean
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
acidification destruction of farmland
 
05:11:22.730 --> 05:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
and costly adaptations to the buildings
 
05:11:25.010 --> 05:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
in which people live and work often in
 
05:11:27.530 --> 05:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
the form of extra air conditioning
 
05:11:29.930 --> 05:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
so just last week uh the first ever
 
05:11:31.970 --> 05:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed study of exxon's internal
 
05:11:34.368 --> 05:11:34.378 align:start position:0%
climate projections was released showing
 
05:11:36.530 --> 05:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
that company scientists predicted the
 
05:11:38.150 --> 05:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
future rate of global warming with
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
startling accuracy even as their
 
05:11:42.590 --> 05:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
Executives publicly so doubt about the
 
05:11:44.090 --> 05:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
climate science
 
05:11:45.770 --> 05:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
company Executives understood that
 
05:11:47.810 --> 05:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
addressing climate change meant limiting
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions which would hurt the
 
05:11:52.368 --> 05:11:52.378 align:start position:0%
industry's bottom line so the oil and
 
05:11:54.410 --> 05:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
gas companies took a page from the big
 
05:11:56.570 --> 05:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
tobacco Playbook like the tobacco
 
05:11:58.010 --> 05:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
companies that denied their products
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
cause cancer and addiction oil and gas
 
05:12:02.090 --> 05:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
companies spread disinformation about
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
their product's leading role in causing
 
05:12:06.530 --> 05:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
climate change documents have revealed a
 
05:12:08.628 --> 05:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
massive coordinated campaign to lie to
 
05:12:11.628 --> 05:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
the public lawmakers and the media about
 
05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
the catastrophic impacts they knew their
 
05:12:16.010 --> 05:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
products would cause the further reveal
 
05:12:17.510 --> 05:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
how the industry spent millions of
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
dollars to block climate action over the
 
05:12:22.490 --> 05:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
last several decades
 
05:12:25.250 --> 05:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
so in addition to a mountain of internal
 
05:12:27.530 --> 05:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
company documents Exxon insiders have
 
05:12:29.810 --> 05:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
gone on the record uh to talk about what
 
05:12:31.730 --> 05:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
the company knew and what it did with
 
05:12:33.590 --> 05:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
that knowledge a former scientific
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
consultant testified under oath before
 
05:12:38.690 --> 05:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
Congress saying quote Exxon was publicly
 
05:12:40.730 --> 05:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
promoting views that its own scientists
 
05:12:42.288 --> 05:12:42.298 align:start position:0%
knew were wrong
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
the company's top lobbyists admitted
 
05:12:47.330 --> 05:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
um this in a recorded interview quote
 
05:12:49.430 --> 05:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
did we aggressively fight against some
 
05:12:53.270 --> 05:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the science yes in 2021 while
 
05:12:55.128 --> 05:12:55.138 align:start position:0%
testifying under oath before Congress
 
05:12:59.510 --> 05:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
current Exxon executive CEO Darren woods
 
05:13:02.208 --> 05:13:02.218 align:start position:0%
and other oil Executives even refused to
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
pledge to stop spending money on lies
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
about climate change
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
yet even as these companies undermine
 
05:13:10.128 --> 05:13:10.138 align:start position:0%
the science and lied to the public about
 
05:13:11.930 --> 05:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
the role of fossil fuels in perpetuating
 
05:13:14.208 --> 05:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
the climate crisis the industry took the
 
05:13:16.128 --> 05:13:16.138 align:start position:0%
issue seriously enough to protect their
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
own assets from the from a warming world
 
05:13:22.128 --> 05:13:22.138 align:start position:0%
as early as the 1970s companies like
 
05:13:24.830 --> 05:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
Chevron and shell were filing patents
 
05:13:26.330 --> 05:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
for equipment that would work in a
 
05:13:28.730 --> 05:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
warming Arctic and raising oil rigs to
 
05:13:30.530 --> 05:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
account for sea level rise
 
05:13:32.690 --> 05:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
while the industry's infrastructure may
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
be very well protected against the harms
 
05:13:36.890 --> 05:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
caused by climate change communities
 
05:13:38.570 --> 05:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
across the country and here in New
 
05:13:40.730 --> 05:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are now facing staggering
 
05:13:43.490 --> 05:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
costs to adapt to a worsening crisis
 
05:13:45.890 --> 05:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
so who should be the ones to cover the
 
05:13:48.590 --> 05:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
cost of climate damages taxpayers and
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
impacted communities or the companies
 
05:13:53.330 --> 05:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
that knowingly created and continue to
 
05:13:55.610 --> 05:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
profit from the climate emergency we are
 
05:13:58.430 --> 05:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
now facing I for one don't think that
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
those costs should fall 100 on the backs
 
05:14:03.350 --> 05:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers it is more than reasonable
 
05:14:06.170 --> 05:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
for Big Oil to pay their fair share of
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
the damage they caused
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office has a long
 
05:14:11.510 --> 05:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
history of holding Bad actors
 
05:14:12.890 --> 05:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
accountable for the damage they've
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
caused to the people of New Hampshire
 
05:14:16.430 --> 05:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
when the tobacco and the opioid
 
05:14:17.930 --> 05:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
Industries engage in fraudulent
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
fraudulent and deceptive practices the
 
05:14:22.368 --> 05:14:22.378 align:start position:0%
Attorney General took action to hold
 
05:14:24.110 --> 05:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
them accountable for the resulting harms
 
05:14:26.510 --> 05:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
their actions had caused in recent years
 
05:14:28.128 --> 05:14:28.138 align:start position:0%
like representative Kaplan mentioned
 
05:14:30.650 --> 05:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
eight attorneys generals have taken
 
05:14:32.330 --> 05:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel companies to court to hold
 
05:14:34.368 --> 05:14:34.378 align:start position:0%
them accountable for the costs of their
 
05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
climate lies these include the
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
neighboring states of Vermont
 
05:14:39.530 --> 05:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Connecticut and Rhode
 
05:14:41.810 --> 05:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
Island the plaintiffs in each of these
 
05:14:43.430 --> 05:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
cases have made the following argument
 
05:14:47.030 --> 05:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
big oil companies knew they lied and
 
05:14:48.890 --> 05:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
they should be held accountable
 
05:14:50.930 --> 05:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
just as tobacco and opioid industries
 
05:14:52.610 --> 05:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
were held accountable for their fraud
 
05:14:55.368 --> 05:14:55.378 align:start position:0%
and deception and the resulting harm the
 
05:14:57.470 --> 05:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industry must not be allowed
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
to escape legal liability and pass off
 
05:15:02.750 --> 05:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary costs of these harms
 
05:15:03.948 --> 05:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
with impunity
 
05:15:06.350 --> 05:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
so I urge you I vote I am fate in favor
 
05:15:08.330 --> 05:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
of this resolution and I support
 
05:15:12.230 --> 05:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan thank you so much
 
05:15:14.990 --> 05:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Stein would you accept any
 
05:15:17.090 --> 05:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
questions absolutely
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions go ahead
 
05:15:21.530 --> 05:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative gagne
 
05:15:23.570 --> 05:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that all that you've said is
 
05:15:27.470 --> 05:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
true I'm assuming that it's all true
 
05:15:27.480 --> 05:15:29.270 align:start position:0%
true I'm assuming that it's all true
okay

05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
that would deal with the United States
 
05:15:33.770 --> 05:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
would deal with the oil companies
 
05:15:36.470 --> 05:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
fine what do we do with China what do we
 
05:15:38.510 --> 05:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
do with Russia all those they're
 
05:15:41.030 --> 05:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
building like one coal plant a day in
 
05:15:43.550 --> 05:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
China right so what do we do so we're
 
05:15:46.610 --> 05:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
gonna punish us ourselves but allow the
 
05:15:48.350 --> 05:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
other ones to do their own their thing
 
05:15:51.288 --> 05:15:51.298 align:start position:0%
we have a prevailing westerlies it's
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to come across the country so why
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
should we punish us
 
05:15:58.190 --> 05:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
without going after the other ones I
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question thank you and
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
it's a good one I think that there is a
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
role for the Judiciary to play and
 
05:16:05.690 --> 05:16:05.700 align:start position:0%
there's a role for policy and there's a
 
05:16:07.128 --> 05:16:07.138 align:start position:0%
role for international policy right and
 
05:16:08.330 --> 05:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
all of these things have to work in
 
05:16:10.190 --> 05:16:10.200 align:start position:0%
concert with each other I think this
 
05:16:12.050 --> 05:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
slice of the pie dealing with the
 
05:16:15.288 --> 05:16:15.298 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is following really classic
 
05:16:17.690 --> 05:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
um law that has precedent and it's just
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
making sure that these companies don't
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
continue to lie and make sure that these
 
05:16:23.208 --> 05:16:23.218 align:start position:0%
communities that are suffering climate
 
05:16:24.830 --> 05:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
harms have the resources they need to
 
05:16:26.030 --> 05:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
survive it
 
05:16:26.040 --> 05:16:28.010 align:start position:0%
survive it
follow-up

05:16:28.010 --> 05:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you thank you for my
 
05:16:30.958 --> 05:16:32.270 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you thank you for my
follow-up

05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:16:35.750 --> 05:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay I burn oil in my house do you think
 
05:16:37.128 --> 05:16:37.138 align:start position:0%
that the oil companies if they're
 
05:16:38.510 --> 05:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
punished and they have to pay fines
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
don't you think that's going to come
 
05:16:43.610 --> 05:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
back on to the consumer
 
05:16:46.010 --> 05:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
so you know I'm not going to buy a Tesla
 
05:16:48.170 --> 05:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
because I can't afford one and I don't
 
05:16:49.550 --> 05:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
want any of those
 
05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
solar panels on my roof I like what I've
 
05:16:54.650 --> 05:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
got right now I shouldn't have to pay 18
 
05:16:57.470 --> 05:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
for a gallon of heating oil to heat my
 
05:16:59.448 --> 05:16:59.458 align:start position:0%
house so how do you answer that
 
05:17:01.250 --> 05:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
it's also a good question
 
05:17:03.288 --> 05:17:03.298 align:start position:0%
um I have some good tip about that um so
 
05:17:04.730 --> 05:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
I would say I would say a couple things
 
05:17:07.310 --> 05:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
one that the cost is already being
 
05:17:09.890 --> 05:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
passed on to us right now taxpayers are
 
05:17:11.930 --> 05:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
being forced to foot billions of dollars
 
05:17:14.208 --> 05:17:14.218 align:start position:0%
in the bills from the damages uh these
 
05:17:15.830 --> 05:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
companies cause and these companies
 
05:17:18.230 --> 05:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
aren't paying a dime of that currently
 
05:17:19.788 --> 05:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
um but they also receive massive
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
subsidies and tax breaks from the
 
05:17:23.570 --> 05:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
government again at the expense of
 
05:17:23.580 --> 05:17:25.368 align:start position:0%
government again at the expense of
taxpayers

05:17:25.368 --> 05:17:25.378 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
05:17:25.378 --> 05:17:26.030 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
um

05:17:26.030 --> 05:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:28.970 --> 05:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
but I think uh probably more directly to
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
um what would it cost our communities
 
05:17:35.750 --> 05:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the state to not take action climate
 
05:17:37.250 --> 05:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
and adaptation costs they're here
 
05:17:39.708 --> 05:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
they're only mounting and one way or the
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
other communities are going to be forced
 
05:17:43.250 --> 05:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
to pay this bill and the only question
 
05:17:45.170 --> 05:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
is will they do it alone or with the
 
05:17:48.110 --> 05:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
help of those most responsible
 
05:17:48.120 --> 05:17:53.030 align:start position:0%
help of those most responsible
foreign

05:17:53.030 --> 05:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:54.230 --> 05:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:56.030 --> 05:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I agree with you about the issue of
 
05:17:58.670 --> 05:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
you know of uh subsidies and
 
05:18:00.770 --> 05:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
in those kind of issues
 
05:18:00.780 --> 05:18:01.910 align:start position:0%
in those kind of issues
um

05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:03.530 --> 05:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
but I think in this country we have a
 
05:18:05.570 --> 05:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
precedent of
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
these these big energy corporations they
 
05:18:11.448 --> 05:18:11.458 align:start position:0%
they treat the Clean Air Act as like a
 
05:18:14.030 --> 05:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
as you know it's just like a fine how do
 
05:18:16.368 --> 05:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
we how do we uh
 
05:18:19.868 --> 05:18:19.878 align:start position:0%
change the law in your guys's view that
 
05:18:22.250 --> 05:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
strengthening the fine would stop them
 
05:18:24.170 --> 05:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
from from polluting the water in the air
 
05:18:26.330 --> 05:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
because currently with paying these
 
05:18:27.948 --> 05:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
fines that the government is giving them
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
in the billions of dollars we're not
 
05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
seeing any changes so what uh what what
 
05:18:35.570 --> 05:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
kind of action would this HCR
 
05:18:39.230 --> 05:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
specifically be doing at all
 
05:18:42.350 --> 05:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that and I am um not a
 
05:18:44.750 --> 05:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act expert so I'm gonna try my
 
05:18:47.208 --> 05:18:47.218 align:start position:0%
best here but um I think with with
 
05:18:50.690 --> 05:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
regards to uh hdr5 this has to do with
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
the state and the Attorney General's
 
05:18:54.770 --> 05:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
office so it's really less of a policy
 
05:18:57.170 --> 05:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
question and more of you know what is
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
the what does the what are the tools
 
05:19:00.590 --> 05:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general has in their
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
office to make sure that taxpayers are
 
05:19:04.490 --> 05:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
not on the hook for all of these costs
 
05:19:06.890 --> 05:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
so I yeah and I think that
 
05:19:08.448 --> 05:19:08.458 align:start position:0%
um that precedent is out there in the
 
05:19:10.368 --> 05:19:10.378 align:start position:0%
form of tobacco and opioid cases right
 
05:19:12.170 --> 05:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
we've seen you know when they lie there
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:18.350 --> 05:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative
 
05:19:18.360 --> 05:19:19.910 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative
Massimo

05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
Massimo
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:19:23.330 --> 05:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:19:25.550 --> 05:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
um it's two-part first of all is your
 
05:19:28.550 --> 05:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
testimony available for us I submitted
 
05:19:31.550 --> 05:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
online yesterday okay thank you
 
05:19:33.708 --> 05:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
one thing is you referred to a couple of
 
05:19:35.868 --> 05:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
court cases that other New England
 
05:19:37.610 --> 05:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
states had brought forward regarding
 
05:19:40.368 --> 05:19:40.378 align:start position:0%
this what were the outcomes so they are
 
05:19:42.890 --> 05:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
still um in their it's a been a long
 
05:19:42.900 --> 05:19:44.510 align:start position:0%
still um in their it's a been a long
process

05:19:44.510 --> 05:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
um let's see I have uh so
 
05:19:51.470 --> 05:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's been a big effort from the
 
05:19:52.910 --> 05:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
companies themselves to delay these
 
05:19:55.128 --> 05:19:55.138 align:start position:0%
cases as long as humanly possible
 
05:19:56.930 --> 05:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
um but they have not had any success in
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
doing that well they've had some success
 
05:19:59.628 --> 05:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
in delaying it but they haven't made
 
05:20:01.550 --> 05:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
these cases go away
 
05:20:04.250 --> 05:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
um judges unanimous unanimously all over
 
05:20:05.868 --> 05:20:05.878 align:start position:0%
the country have ruled in favor of the
 
05:20:07.970 --> 05:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs to allow these cases to
 
05:20:10.550 --> 05:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
proceed towards trial so they're all at
 
05:20:13.250 --> 05:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
different stages of litigation the state
 
05:20:15.890 --> 05:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts and the municipality of
 
05:20:19.730 --> 05:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
Honolulu Hawaii have both are in process
 
05:20:22.250 --> 05:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
of pre-trial Discovery and we you know
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
hope and expect that some of the more
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.590 --> 05:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:34.610 --> 05:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
05:20:37.190 --> 05:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
Miss yornstein thank you
 
05:20:40.010 --> 05:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
and I see
 
05:20:42.530 --> 05:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
both John and Catherine Gage are in the
 
05:20:44.990 --> 05:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
house over here last year
 
05:20:45.000 --> 05:20:45.770 align:start position:0%
house over here last year
um

05:20:45.770 --> 05:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:49.610 --> 05:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.128 --> 05:20:52.138 align:start position:0%
who asked for three minutes
 
05:20:54.770 --> 05:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of this resolution
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
welcome back Catherine
 
05:21:00.650 --> 05:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:03.288 --> 05:21:03.298 align:start position:0%
um I would like to testify in support of
 
05:21:05.390 --> 05:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
this resolution because I think it's
 
05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
really important to hold fossil fuel
 
05:21:11.090 --> 05:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
industry accountable for their decision
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
to continue to pollute that is harming
 
05:21:17.448 --> 05:21:17.458 align:start position:0%
all of us and the environment after they
 
05:21:19.610 --> 05:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
researched several decades ago and
 
05:21:21.830 --> 05:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
figured out the harm that they were
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
doing with their products and they chose
 
05:21:27.230 --> 05:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
to continue anyway and not only are they
 
05:21:29.750 --> 05:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
causing all the problems we have but
 
05:21:31.310 --> 05:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
they're also making it very hard to
 
05:21:33.650 --> 05:21:33.660 align:start position:0%
address the problems because of their
 
05:21:36.288 --> 05:21:36.298 align:start position:0%
influence in politics
 
05:21:38.570 --> 05:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
um when I was in eighth or middle school
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
I learned about a policy called cash
 
05:21:44.930 --> 05:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
back carbon pricing that would be really
 
05:21:46.910 --> 05:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
helpful in addressing climate change so
 
05:21:49.070 --> 05:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
I joined a group to Lobby Congress for
 
05:21:50.750 --> 05:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
it and I thought that it would be a
 
05:21:52.310 --> 05:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
great idea so they would
 
05:21:54.230 --> 05:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
probably get on board and it would pass
 
05:21:57.350 --> 05:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
sometime soon but it has made very
 
05:21:58.970 --> 05:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
little progress since then like six
 
05:22:01.850 --> 05:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
years later and that's because there's
 
05:22:04.430 --> 05:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
so much fossil fuel industry funding in
 
05:22:06.170 --> 05:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
Congress in both parties and it's
 
05:22:08.448 --> 05:22:08.458 align:start position:0%
preventing really meaningful action on
 
05:22:11.868 --> 05:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
climate change which would be bad for
 
05:22:13.070 --> 05:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
their business
 
05:22:15.170 --> 05:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
um so it's really important to hold them
 
05:22:17.330 --> 05:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
accountable for what they're doing
 
05:22:19.550 --> 05:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
because they've shown that their top
 
05:22:22.128 --> 05:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
priority is money not our health and
 
05:22:24.890 --> 05:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
safety and the environment and
 
05:22:24.900 --> 05:22:26.090 align:start position:0%
safety and the environment and
so

05:22:26.090 --> 05:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
I think this resolution would help with
 
05:22:31.010 --> 05:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
05:22:33.590 --> 05:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Gage questions for the
 
05:22:37.788 --> 05:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:40.610 --> 05:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
thanks again thank you
 
05:22:43.250 --> 05:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
and John Gage
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
from Windham representing himself asking
 
05:23:01.550 --> 05:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:01.560 --> 05:23:05.150 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:23:05.150 --> 05:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:06.830 --> 05:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
chair I really appreciate the
 
05:23:09.288 --> 05:23:09.298 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you today
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
um this is this issue has affected me
 
05:23:14.708 --> 05:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
personally uh I started losing I started
 
05:23:17.330 --> 05:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
my science background in college I have
 
05:23:19.788 --> 05:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
a biology degree I learned about global
 
05:23:19.798 --> 05:23:20.750 align:start position:0%
a biology degree I learned about global
warming

05:23:20.750 --> 05:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
warming
 
05:23:23.930 --> 05:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
40 years ago and figured that the
 
05:23:25.730 --> 05:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
um the experts would take care of the
 
05:23:25.740 --> 05:23:26.750 align:start position:0%
um the experts would take care of the
problem

05:23:26.750 --> 05:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:23:29.208 --> 05:23:29.218 align:start position:0%
uh 10 years ago
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
about when the Ned pipeline was going to
 
05:23:33.770 --> 05:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
go through my town I started seeing news
 
05:23:35.930 --> 05:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
articles that were just wrong about
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
general science about global warming I I
 
05:23:41.330 --> 05:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
knew greenhouse gases from fossil fuels
 
05:23:44.030 --> 05:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
was climate pollution I knew that there
 
05:23:45.288 --> 05:23:45.298 align:start position:0%
was some kind of problem but I didn't
 
05:23:47.330 --> 05:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
know much about it I did a lot of
 
05:23:47.340 --> 05:23:49.490 align:start position:0%
know much about it I did a lot of
research

05:23:49.490 --> 05:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
research
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
about the science of global warming and
 
05:23:56.030 --> 05:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
about why we hadn't solved yet this is a
 
05:23:58.070 --> 05:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
book by noima reskis called merchants of
 
05:23:58.080 --> 05:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
book by noima reskis called merchants of
doubt

05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
doubt
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
10 years ago she did a study she's a
 
05:24:07.610 --> 05:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
Harvard researcher why the public was so
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
out of line with the science the
 
05:24:13.850 --> 05:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
scientists were 97 percent confident
 
05:24:16.190 --> 05:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
that human activities were causing
 
05:24:19.430 --> 05:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
global warming but the public was 50 and
 
05:24:23.390 --> 05:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
why was that and it was because of this
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
disinformation campaign that you heard
 
05:24:25.680 --> 05:24:26.930 align:start position:0%
disinformation campaign that you heard
about

05:24:26.930 --> 05:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:24:29.170 --> 05:24:29.180 align:start position:0%
um there was Pulitzer Prize winning
 
05:24:31.368 --> 05:24:31.378 align:start position:0%
investigative journalism from inside
 
05:24:33.650 --> 05:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
climate news and the Los Angeles Times
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
which further exposed what the fossil
 
05:24:38.628 --> 05:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
fuel industry knew in the 70s about
 
05:24:41.448 --> 05:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
global warming from their pollution and
 
05:24:43.448 --> 05:24:43.458 align:start position:0%
how accurate that has turned out today
 
05:24:46.970 --> 05:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
in terms of the emissions rise rise of
 
05:24:49.310 --> 05:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
concentration of CO2 and what we see in
 
05:24:50.930 --> 05:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere and the rise of
 
05:24:50.940 --> 05:24:52.430 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere and the rise of
temperatures

05:24:52.430 --> 05:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
temperatures
 
05:24:52.440 --> 05:24:53.090 align:start position:0%
temperatures
um

05:24:53.090 --> 05:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know this is frustrating because I
 
05:24:58.128 --> 05:24:58.138 align:start position:0%
left my job four years ago at Oracle
 
05:25:01.788 --> 05:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
Corporation to volunteer full-time uh as
 
05:25:03.708 --> 05:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
my daughter said to help create the
 
05:25:05.628 --> 05:25:05.638 align:start position:0%
political will to enable Congress to
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
pass effective and Equitable legislation
 
05:25:10.250 --> 05:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
so you asked about what what about China
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative gagne it's a simple
 
05:25:14.448 --> 05:25:14.458 align:start position:0%
policy economists they're almost
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
universally in support of to address
 
05:25:20.770 --> 05:25:20.780 align:start position:0%
your concern and many other concerns
 
05:25:26.050 --> 05:25:26.060 align:start position:0%
and a year ago to this day we testified
 
05:25:30.590 --> 05:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
against H.R 17 which was a resolution
 
05:25:32.810 --> 05:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
against the carbon tax
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
but economists say
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
we put a tax on pollution in our own
 
05:25:40.850 --> 05:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
economy by charging the polluting
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
Industries the fossil fuel producers
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
rebate all the money back to households
 
05:25:47.090 --> 05:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
each month in an equal per capita
 
05:25:49.250 --> 05:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
dividend to protect purchasing power
 
05:25:51.170 --> 05:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
that will let most people come out ahead
 
05:25:53.330 --> 05:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
financially more money each month in
 
05:25:55.190 --> 05:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
their carbon dividend than their pain
 
05:25:57.530 --> 05:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
and total higher prices
 
05:25:59.090 --> 05:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
but a price on pollution is the most
 
05:26:01.070 --> 05:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
cost effective way to reduce it so the
 
05:26:02.990 --> 05:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industry does not want a
 
05:26:07.010 --> 05:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
price on carbon what about China well as
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
our carbon price Rises and fossil fuels
 
05:26:10.550 --> 05:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
get more expensive manufacturers are
 
05:26:12.010 --> 05:26:12.020 align:start position:0%
going to be paying higher energy prices
 
05:26:14.868 --> 05:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
this is going to cause our manufacturers
 
05:26:17.690 --> 05:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
to go out of out of the country to to be
 
05:26:19.788 --> 05:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
able to produce on cheaper energy unless
 
05:26:21.530 --> 05:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
we use border carbon adjustments which
 
05:26:23.868 --> 05:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
is the third part of the solution we can
 
05:26:27.050 --> 05:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
charge our carbon fion imports from free
 
05:26:28.910 --> 05:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
polluting countries and rebate our
 
05:26:30.770 --> 05:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
exporters so they can compete on a Level
 
05:26:33.110 --> 05:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
Playing Field in both markets this will
 
05:26:34.910 --> 05:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
make U.S manufacturers more competitive
 
05:26:37.128 --> 05:26:37.138 align:start position:0%
against developing countries this will
 
05:26:39.530 --> 05:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
help us be more competitive right now
 
05:26:39.540 --> 05:26:40.368 align:start position:0%
help us be more competitive right now
today

05:26:40.368 --> 05:26:40.378 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:26:42.050 --> 05:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
Europe and other countries are already
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
doing this the European Union's price is
 
05:26:46.010 --> 05:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
80 a ton and they're going to use border
 
05:26:47.690 --> 05:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
carbon adjustments
 
05:26:49.850 --> 05:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
um on papers during this year and for
 
05:26:51.948 --> 05:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
real in three more years they're going
 
05:26:54.170 --> 05:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
to start charging our exporters our
 
05:26:55.910 --> 05:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
carbon price when we sell into the EU
 
05:26:55.920 --> 05:26:57.410 align:start position:0%
carbon price when we sell into the EU
Market

05:26:57.410 --> 05:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
Market
 
05:26:59.208 --> 05:26:59.218 align:start position:0%
um Canada's using carbon fee and
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
dividend and they're watching the EU
 
05:27:02.810 --> 05:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
will probably join the carbon Club we're
 
05:27:04.970 --> 05:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
going to start paying more and more for
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
our carbon pollution
 
05:27:10.368 --> 05:27:10.378 align:start position:0%
um we testified on against the
 
05:27:12.410 --> 05:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
resolution that I don't think came from
 
05:27:13.850 --> 05:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
within our state
 
05:27:16.610 --> 05:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
so the fossil fuel industry money is
 
05:27:19.490 --> 05:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
smart it's not directly
 
05:27:19.500 --> 05:27:20.628 align:start position:0%
smart it's not directly
um

05:27:20.628 --> 05:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:23.150 --> 05:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
visible on what the doubt and
 
05:27:25.670 --> 05:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
misinformation that our society is
 
05:27:28.670 --> 05:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
receiving there's an intermediary group
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
of organizations front groups that take
 
05:27:34.010 --> 05:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel money
 
05:27:36.350 --> 05:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
and then create the propaganda and the
 
05:27:38.690 --> 05:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
talking points and the talking heads and
 
05:27:41.090 --> 05:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
some of these groups are producing
 
05:27:43.310 --> 05:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
material that our legislature is
 
05:27:45.170 --> 05:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
receiving they're American for
 
05:27:49.610 --> 05:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
Prosperity Heartland Institute Alec
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
um in the testimony last year of H.R 17
 
05:27:55.730 --> 05:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
the the sponsors of the bill said they
 
05:27:57.530 --> 05:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
had been to conferences of these groups
 
05:27:58.610 --> 05:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
and they came back with information
 
05:28:01.368 --> 05:28:01.378 align:start position:0%
about climate change that was completely
 
05:28:01.378 --> 05:28:02.510 align:start position:0%
about climate change that was completely
wrong

05:28:02.510 --> 05:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:28:04.430 --> 05:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
now we have a climate scientist in our
 
05:28:04.440 --> 05:28:05.628 align:start position:0%
now we have a climate scientist in our
state

05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:28:07.490 --> 05:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
um the the booklets that I handed out is
 
05:28:09.230 --> 05:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
the fourth National Climate assessment
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is the best information about
 
05:28:13.128 --> 05:28:13.138 align:start position:0%
climate change from our federal
 
05:28:15.230 --> 05:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
government organizations NASA and no
 
05:28:16.610 --> 05:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
other department of energy Department of
 
05:28:16.620 --> 05:28:18.708 align:start position:0%
other department of energy Department of
Defense

05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
Defense
 
05:28:20.868 --> 05:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
we should not be listening to the
 
05:28:22.970 --> 05:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
information from front groups paid by
 
05:28:25.250 --> 05:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industries that are trying
 
05:28:27.410 --> 05:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
to delay action on behalf of the fossil
 
05:28:29.930 --> 05:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
fuel polluters we should be listening to
 
05:28:32.810 --> 05:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
our scientists here at nhdes
 
05:28:35.288 --> 05:28:35.298 align:start position:0%
um Dr Mary stampone
 
05:28:39.590 --> 05:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the national uh the U.S Global
 
05:28:41.810 --> 05:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
change research program this is what we
 
05:28:43.490 --> 05:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
know through science
 
05:28:46.250 --> 05:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
um and we need to
 
05:28:48.410 --> 05:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
see that we're being tricked by
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
out-of-state polluter influence
 
05:28:50.878 --> 05:28:51.470 align:start position:0%
out-of-state polluter influence
um

05:28:51.470 --> 05:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
these groups Market themselves as
 
05:28:55.970 --> 05:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
conservative value organizations and
 
05:28:58.750 --> 05:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
they do advocate for strong conservative
 
05:29:01.970 --> 05:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
values in many things but that doesn't
 
05:29:04.010 --> 05:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
make them right about everything and so
 
05:29:05.570 --> 05:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
if they write about 80 percent of what
 
05:29:09.530 --> 05:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
they do but the bottom 20 is to lie and
 
05:29:11.690 --> 05:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
mislead about the pollution from fossil
 
05:29:14.390 --> 05:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
fuels we don't have to believe that part
 
05:29:17.868 --> 05:29:17.878 align:start position:0%
of the messages that they spread
 
05:29:20.570 --> 05:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
uh so I strongly support this resolution
 
05:29:22.970 --> 05:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh we need to hold the guilty parties
 
05:29:26.030 --> 05:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
accountable for for frauding the the
 
05:29:28.430 --> 05:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
public and delaying action to address
 
05:29:32.090 --> 05:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
their pollution for four decades
 
05:29:34.368 --> 05:29:34.378 align:start position:0%
um this doesn't have to cost raise the
 
05:29:35.930 --> 05:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
cost of energy we can take away their
 
05:29:38.570 --> 05:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
license to advertise we can take
 
05:29:40.310 --> 05:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
um away some of the ill-gotten gains
 
05:29:42.410 --> 05:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
from some of the leaders I recommend
 
05:29:43.850 --> 05:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
carbon fee and dividend with border
 
05:29:46.128 --> 05:29:46.138 align:start position:0%
adjustments to take care of the problem
 
05:29:49.390 --> 05:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
reducing emissions and addressing
 
05:29:51.708 --> 05:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
external pollution from countries like
 
05:29:51.718 --> 05:29:53.330 align:start position:0%
external pollution from countries like
China

05:29:53.330 --> 05:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
China
 
05:29:54.770 --> 05:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:57.050 --> 05:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Gage questions uh
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
representative gagne
 
05:30:01.850 --> 05:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:30:04.250 --> 05:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming for
 
05:30:06.288 --> 05:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
thinking you are not really high on
 
05:30:08.570 --> 05:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels is that correct
 
05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh I use them every day I've got a like
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
two cars that burn gasoline I've got an
 
05:30:15.830 --> 05:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
oil furnace I'm not big on global
 
05:30:17.628 --> 05:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
warming because I understand the science
 
05:30:20.750 --> 05:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
it poses a extremely serious threat to
 
05:30:22.610 --> 05:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
me and an even bigger threat to my
 
05:30:25.610 --> 05:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
daughter and future generations and
 
05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
we're paying for the the costs of the
 
05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
pollution all over the place and I
 
05:30:31.970 --> 05:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
resent the fact that the polluting
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
industry has tricked so many people that
 
05:30:36.730 --> 05:30:36.740 align:start position:0%
we can't address their pollution problem
 
05:30:40.490 --> 05:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh and we're all using polluting energy
 
05:30:42.410 --> 05:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
because we haven't been able to make the
 
05:30:45.050 --> 05:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
policy changes necessary to transition
 
05:30:46.970 --> 05:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
to clean energy
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:53.208 --> 05:30:53.218 align:start position:0%
so that what you said at the end just
 
05:30:55.910 --> 05:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
led me to this to my other question if
 
05:30:58.730 --> 05:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
we could get rid of fossils fossil fuels
 
05:31:00.770 --> 05:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
look I grew up in from Canada burning
 
05:31:04.970 --> 05:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:07.610 --> 05:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
if there was an alternate method
 
05:31:11.868 --> 05:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
and other than just electric okay in the
 
05:31:13.788 --> 05:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
05:31:17.510 --> 05:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
would you be in favor of exploring
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
nuclear power sure which burns its clean
 
05:31:23.810 --> 05:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
except for the for the waste but you can
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
bury that thousands of feet down yeah
 
05:31:27.230 --> 05:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
and a fourth generation looks like you
 
05:31:29.390 --> 05:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
can use some of the ways to produce more
 
05:31:31.310 --> 05:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
power and then the waste from that has a
 
05:31:33.470 --> 05:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
much shorter Half-Life I'm in favor of
 
05:31:35.810 --> 05:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
of an efficient energy Market
 
05:31:39.230 --> 05:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
I think trying to pick the solutions and
 
05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
using government to you know reward some
 
05:31:44.270 --> 05:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
things and and not others is the wrong
 
05:31:44.280 --> 05:31:45.708 align:start position:0%
things and and not others is the wrong
approach

05:31:45.708 --> 05:31:45.718 align:start position:0%
approach
 
05:31:47.810 --> 05:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
um there's an economist statement in
 
05:31:49.368 --> 05:31:49.378 align:start position:0%
favor of carbon fee and dividend with
 
05:31:51.948 --> 05:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
border adjustments supported by over 3
 
05:31:55.310 --> 05:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
600 U.S economists including two dozen
 
05:31:57.948 --> 05:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth and UNH
 
05:31:59.930 --> 05:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and they say what we need is an
 
05:32:01.550 --> 05:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
efficient energy market so we can
 
05:32:04.610 --> 05:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
Unleash the Power of the market to
 
05:32:06.530 --> 05:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
provide the solutions for us we're not
 
05:32:08.690 --> 05:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
going to get off of fossil fuels in a
 
05:32:11.930 --> 05:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
decade but we can correct the failure of
 
05:32:13.850 --> 05:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
the market to account for the costs of
 
05:32:16.128 --> 05:32:16.138 align:start position:0%
using fossil fuels in their price in a
 
05:32:18.410 --> 05:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
way that protects U.S businesses and
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
household purchasing power and holds
 
05:32:22.430 --> 05:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
other countries accountable if we do
 
05:32:25.070 --> 05:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
that the solutions that we need will
 
05:32:28.190 --> 05:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
arise through our free market Innovation
 
05:32:30.650 --> 05:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
and investment will happen and it's the
 
05:32:32.510 --> 05:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
fastest most cost effective way to
 
05:32:34.490 --> 05:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
transition off of fossil fuels I can't
 
05:32:36.110 --> 05:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
tell you what the winners will be I
 
05:32:38.270 --> 05:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
suspect nuclear will be a good firm
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
power solution but it's expensive so it
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
won't be every it won't be all the
 
05:32:44.448 --> 05:32:44.458 align:start position:0%
solutions it will be offshore wind there
 
05:32:47.628 --> 05:32:47.638 align:start position:0%
will be geothermal there will be solar
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
but let's let them compete on a Level
 
05:32:51.650 --> 05:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
Playing Field right now that subsidy
 
05:32:52.730 --> 05:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
that we're giving the fossil fuel
 
05:32:54.650 --> 05:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
industry by letting them have free
 
05:32:57.230 --> 05:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
pollution makes their
 
05:32:59.628 --> 05:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
products the most competitive in the
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
market but that's only because we're
 
05:33:05.090 --> 05:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
subsidizing their businesses by giving
 
05:33:07.250 --> 05:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
them a free write-off of all their
 
05:33:09.050 --> 05:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
pollution costs
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
I have one more sir one more follow-up
 
05:33:13.030 --> 05:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:33:16.430 --> 05:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
you are also aware that the solar panels
 
05:33:18.170 --> 05:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
and the wind power industries are also
 
05:33:19.850 --> 05:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
being subsidized by the government right
 
05:33:22.970 --> 05:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
by our taxes yeah I think the total
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
subsidy for clean energy is dwarfed by
 
05:33:29.030 --> 05:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
both the direct explicit subsidies that
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
we give the fossil fuel industry like
 
05:33:32.570 --> 05:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
oil depletion allowances and land lease
 
05:33:37.250 --> 05:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
deals but also the the implicit costs
 
05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
that we're paying from the damages of
 
05:33:42.350 --> 05:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
the global warming that results from the
 
05:33:43.788 --> 05:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
pollution from the fossil fuel industry
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
which the IMF says is 5.9 trillion
 
05:33:49.010 --> 05:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
dollars globally a year
 
05:33:52.610 --> 05:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollars per Tesla
 
05:33:55.730 --> 05:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
uh Russell Finney thank you Mr chair
 
05:33:58.490 --> 05:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm on the epa's uh site here and um
 
05:34:00.288 --> 05:34:00.298 align:start position:0%
they do say through domestic and
 
05:34:02.030 --> 05:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
international action the ozone layer is
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
healing it should fully recover by 2065.
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh you'd agree that through the
 
05:34:11.150 --> 05:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I guess the social implication that
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know EVS are the the next
 
05:34:15.890 --> 05:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
alternative to to
 
05:34:18.470 --> 05:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
um you know to gas vehicles uh that
 
05:34:19.850 --> 05:34:19.860 align:start position:0%
we've already seen a lot of those
 
05:34:21.530 --> 05:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
pre-market changes that have been kind
 
05:34:23.330 --> 05:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
of forced upon is probably Autumn you
 
05:34:26.208 --> 05:34:26.218 align:start position:0%
know by the uh the makers of all of our
 
05:34:29.750 --> 05:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
cars but also by federal pressure to to
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
change their product from gasoline to
 
05:34:34.430 --> 05:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
EVs and
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
um my other question I had a two-part
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
was would you also agree that there's
 
05:34:41.930 --> 05:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
been a bit of information campaign about
 
05:34:45.170 --> 05:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
the nuclear energy being not safe and
 
05:34:46.730 --> 05:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
effective as it actually is and the
 
05:34:48.590 --> 05:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
waste produced would only fill up about
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
half the room that we're in right now
 
05:34:50.040 --> 05:34:52.310 align:start position:0%
half the room that we're in right now
correct

05:34:52.310 --> 05:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:34:54.830 --> 05:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't know exactly about nuclear
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
waste I know there's
 
05:35:00.650 --> 05:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
um about nine eight million people die a
 
05:35:02.690 --> 05:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
year from the pollution from fossil
 
05:35:06.110 --> 05:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
fuels around the world and very few from
 
05:35:09.288 --> 05:35:09.298 align:start position:0%
uh the results of using nuclear so
 
05:35:12.890 --> 05:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
nuclear is a much more safe fuel than
 
05:35:16.190 --> 05:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels as far as the Montreal
 
05:35:18.350 --> 05:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
protocol that you mentioned
 
05:35:22.730 --> 05:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
um represent President Reagan uh LED
 
05:35:25.610 --> 05:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
that with George Schultz as his
 
05:35:27.948 --> 05:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
secretary of state an international
 
05:35:30.610 --> 05:35:30.620 align:start position:0%
agreement to address
 
05:35:35.390 --> 05:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
CFCs chlorofluorocarbons which was in
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
aerosols and other refrigerants
 
05:35:41.690 --> 05:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
um which were when they released into
 
05:35:44.990 --> 05:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere were destroying ozone in
 
05:35:47.090 --> 05:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
the stratosphere the ozone layer
 
05:35:49.970 --> 05:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
protects us from UV rays
 
05:35:53.150 --> 05:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
um that hole was real uh and the reason
 
05:35:55.070 --> 05:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
that it stopped expanding was because of
 
05:35:57.110 --> 05:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
the Montreal protocol the federal
 
05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
government joined with every other
 
05:36:03.170 --> 05:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
country in the world uh to agree to stop
 
05:36:06.590 --> 05:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
using CFCs and that's why you don't hear
 
05:36:08.948 --> 05:36:08.958 align:start position:0%
about the ozone problem anymore because
 
05:36:11.810 --> 05:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
we joined a treaty and we addressed that
 
05:36:14.990 --> 05:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
pollution problem now unfortunately the
 
05:36:17.530 --> 05:36:17.540 align:start position:0%
replacement for CFCs is hfcs
 
05:36:19.850 --> 05:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
hydrofluorocarbons that turns out to be
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
an extremely powerful greenhouse gas so
 
05:36:24.708 --> 05:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
we've replaced our refrigerants which
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
hfcs and now we find that hfcs are a
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
significant part of the climate
 
05:36:32.330 --> 05:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
pollution problem but the U.S Senate
 
05:36:34.550 --> 05:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
just ratified the Kigali Amendment to
 
05:36:36.410 --> 05:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
the Montreal protocol
 
05:36:40.368 --> 05:36:40.378 align:start position:0%
21 Republicans and about 47 or so
 
05:36:43.250 --> 05:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
Democrats you needed two-thirds vote to
 
05:36:48.050 --> 05:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
pass to amend to join a treaty
 
05:36:51.830 --> 05:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
um the Senate passed this resolution to
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
address hfc climate pollution why did
 
05:36:58.250 --> 05:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
they do that because U.S businesses are
 
05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
actually technical they're leading in
 
05:37:02.510 --> 05:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
the technology for The Replacements of
 
05:37:04.910 --> 05:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
hfcs in refrigerants so this is a
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
competitive Advantage for the us we want
 
05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of the world to stop using hfcs
 
05:37:09.360 --> 05:37:10.190 align:start position:0%
the rest of the world to stop using hfcs
because

05:37:10.190 --> 05:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:37:12.110 --> 05:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
by the end of the century if we didn't
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
do anything that would be worth about
 
05:37:15.650 --> 05:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
0.5 degrees Celsius of warming just from
 
05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
hfcs so we've taken care of that problem
 
05:37:19.970 --> 05:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
and we've made U.S businesses more
 
05:37:21.650 --> 05:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
competitive against China which is the
 
05:37:24.110 --> 05:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
main competitor in the in refrigerants
 
05:37:24.120 --> 05:37:25.730 align:start position:0%
main competitor in the in refrigerants
so

05:37:25.730 --> 05:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:27.650 --> 05:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
we can do the same thing with carbon
 
05:37:27.660 --> 05:37:28.930 align:start position:0%
we can do the same thing with carbon
dioxide

05:37:28.930 --> 05:37:28.940 align:start position:0%
dioxide
 
05:37:32.030 --> 05:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
take a look just think about
 
05:37:34.368 --> 05:37:34.378 align:start position:0%
if you charge every country the same
 
05:37:37.368 --> 05:37:37.378 align:start position:0%
amount for carbon pollution the cleaner
 
05:37:39.350 --> 05:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
countries the cleaner producing
 
05:37:41.690 --> 05:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
countries will pay less of a charge than
 
05:37:44.930 --> 05:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
the dirtier polluting countries so the
 
05:37:47.330 --> 05:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
EU has got a high carbon price they're
 
05:37:49.670 --> 05:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
going to do c-bam starting on paper this
 
05:37:53.150 --> 05:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
year but for real in 2026 we will our
 
05:37:55.250 --> 05:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who export into the EU
 
05:37:58.128 --> 05:37:58.138 align:start position:0%
will have to pay their carbon price when
 
05:38:00.410 --> 05:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
we put our Goods energy intensive Goods
 
05:38:02.510 --> 05:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
into the EU Marketplace
 
05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
you know that's going to make our Goods
 
05:38:05.868 --> 05:38:05.878 align:start position:0%
more expensive right
 
05:38:08.330 --> 05:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
um China is going to have to do the same
 
05:38:10.010 --> 05:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
thing they're going to pay three times
 
05:38:12.170 --> 05:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
as much of a carbon price on their
 
05:38:15.050 --> 05:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
products as we are in India is going to
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
have to pay four times as much carbon
 
05:38:19.670 --> 05:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
price to export goods into the EU
 
05:38:21.590 --> 05:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
Marketplace this is a competitive
 
05:38:24.530 --> 05:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
advantage that businesses will enjoy
 
05:38:26.448 --> 05:38:26.458 align:start position:0%
when we price carbon here and use border
 
05:38:27.948 --> 05:38:27.958 align:start position:0%
adjustments to help push it around the
 
05:38:27.958 --> 05:38:28.910 align:start position:0%
adjustments to help push it around the
world

05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
world
 
05:38:30.350 --> 05:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:38:32.150 --> 05:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
just one more follow-up sorry one more
 
05:38:32.160 --> 05:38:33.350 align:start position:0%
just one more follow-up sorry one more
follow-up

05:38:33.350 --> 05:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:38:37.090 --> 05:38:37.100 align:start position:0%
um it seems it seems more
 
05:38:39.050 --> 05:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
realistic excuse me
 
05:38:40.850 --> 05:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
um that a lot of these you know the
 
05:38:42.770 --> 05:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
major corporations who would contribute
 
05:38:44.930 --> 05:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
to this issue like Exxon you know and
 
05:38:46.368 --> 05:38:46.378 align:start position:0%
and you know Chevron for instance
 
05:38:48.590 --> 05:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
there's they're so big and powerful that
 
05:38:50.570 --> 05:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
these carbon taxes would be treated as a
 
05:38:54.890 --> 05:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
fine these I I'm not convinced or I
 
05:38:56.990 --> 05:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't see a strong argument in favor of
 
05:38:58.970 --> 05:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
a higher tax that would actually solve a
 
05:39:02.090 --> 05:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
problem they would you know
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
they would see the fine as just another
 
05:39:05.208 --> 05:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
payment that they have to make but they
 
05:39:06.470 --> 05:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make any you know you know
 
05:39:10.250 --> 05:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
systemic changes so is this HCR asking
 
05:39:12.110 --> 05:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government to take a
 
05:39:15.530 --> 05:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
stronger step towards I guess
 
05:39:18.830 --> 05:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh stopping the Monopoly in the market
 
05:39:23.330 --> 05:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
by making them make changes because uh
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's not the federal government's
 
05:39:26.868 --> 05:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
roles to regulate you know no this
 
05:39:29.930 --> 05:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
resolution is simply
 
05:39:33.650 --> 05:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
um to go through a legal
 
05:39:36.470 --> 05:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
um form to hold them accountable for the
 
05:39:40.610 --> 05:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
fraud that they are still today part of
 
05:39:43.010 --> 05:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
um they're preventing policy changes
 
05:39:45.050 --> 05:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
that are needed to reduce pollution
 
05:39:47.930 --> 05:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
by funding organizations that produce
 
05:39:50.510 --> 05:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
misinformation and control policies and
 
05:39:53.650 --> 05:39:53.660 align:start position:0%
politics what we're trying to do with HR
 
05:39:57.410 --> 05:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
hcr5 is basically like what we did with
 
05:39:59.330 --> 05:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
the tobacco industry when it got exposed
 
05:40:01.010 --> 05:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
that they knew nicotine was addictive
 
05:40:03.890 --> 05:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
and that smoking caused cancer
 
05:40:05.270 --> 05:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
um they kept saying that they didn't
 
05:40:07.490 --> 05:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
know until papers got released that
 
05:40:09.470 --> 05:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
proved they did and then we held them
 
05:40:12.530 --> 05:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
accountable and so this is the same kind
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
of thing hdr5 simply says look we know
 
05:40:17.208 --> 05:40:17.218 align:start position:0%
we we have proof that the fossil fuel
 
05:40:19.368 --> 05:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
industry knew their carbon emissions
 
05:40:21.948 --> 05:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
were pollution four decades ago
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
um we know they fund disinformation
 
05:40:27.650 --> 05:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
campaigns and are manipulating us to
 
05:40:29.930 --> 05:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
delay acting on their pollution
 
05:40:32.090 --> 05:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
um we need to hold them accountable this
 
05:40:34.490 --> 05:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
is you know racketeering this is
 
05:40:36.410 --> 05:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
um this is not something that we want
 
05:40:37.850 --> 05:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
going on in capitalism it gives
 
05:40:41.448 --> 05:40:41.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:45.170 --> 05:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
other questions represent Manion
 
05:40:47.510 --> 05:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
so uh on on the subject of the I know
 
05:40:48.410 --> 05:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
we're getting into the weeds it's not
 
05:40:50.330 --> 05:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
about this bill but about the um the
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
carbon tariffs across so like the you
 
05:40:54.650 --> 05:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
say the companies would end up paying it
 
05:40:55.850 --> 05:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
but it's actually the consumer that
 
05:40:57.368 --> 05:40:57.378 align:start position:0%
would end up paying it is that not right
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh economists look at it there's a pass
 
05:41:03.050 --> 05:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
through so somewhere between 70 and 100
 
05:41:05.208 --> 05:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
of the fee that you charge a fossil fuel
 
05:41:07.070 --> 05:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
producer will get reflected in the costs
 
05:41:09.230 --> 05:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
of the fuels that they sell which is why
 
05:41:10.610 --> 05:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
what you do with that money that you
 
05:41:12.890 --> 05:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
collect is so important if you put it
 
05:41:14.868 --> 05:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
into a carbon trust and rebate it in
 
05:41:16.730 --> 05:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
equal shares back to all households each
 
05:41:16.740 --> 05:41:17.868 align:start position:0%
equal shares back to all households each
month

05:41:17.868 --> 05:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
month
 
05:41:20.050 --> 05:41:20.060 align:start position:0%
um most families will end up with more
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
carbon cash back than the total that
 
05:41:25.788 --> 05:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
they pay multiple Studies have shown and
 
05:41:27.470 --> 05:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
Canada is doing this today about 80
 
05:41:28.910 --> 05:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
percent of Canadians are coming out
 
05:41:32.090 --> 05:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
ahead so this is a beneficial way to put
 
05:41:33.530 --> 05:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
a price on carbon now the government
 
05:41:34.970 --> 05:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
could spend the money they could pay
 
05:41:36.288 --> 05:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
down debt they could use it for other
 
05:41:38.810 --> 05:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
things you know we advocate for carving
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
cash back because we need the political
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
popularity of it and it also helps
 
05:41:45.590 --> 05:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
families and it supports getting high
 
05:41:48.170 --> 05:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
carbon price that we need so a ton of
 
05:41:50.390 --> 05:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
coal produces about three tons of carbon
 
05:41:53.208 --> 05:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
but the amount of energy you get from a
 
05:41:56.990 --> 05:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
ton of coal is less than what you get
 
05:41:59.050 --> 05:41:59.060 align:start position:0%
from a ton of natural gas
 
05:42:02.930 --> 05:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
and solar and wind you may have to use
 
05:42:04.910 --> 05:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels to produce the equipment
 
05:42:07.490 --> 05:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
until we switch everything but they
 
05:42:10.670 --> 05:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
produce very little so if you put the
 
05:42:12.890 --> 05:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
price on the pollution the market gets
 
05:42:14.448 --> 05:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
to pick the winners and losers based on
 
05:42:17.150 --> 05:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
what is the cheapest and that's why it's
 
05:42:18.590 --> 05:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
so efficient nobody's picking winners
 
05:42:20.750 --> 05:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
and losers You're simply saying let's
 
05:42:22.610 --> 05:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
correct this market failure by pricing
 
05:42:24.350 --> 05:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
pollution and let the market decide what
 
05:42:27.288 --> 05:42:27.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:30.050 --> 05:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:42:33.230 --> 05:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
see number before I let you go uh Mr
 
05:42:34.850 --> 05:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
Gage let me throw something on at you
 
05:42:36.770 --> 05:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
real quick we have one more speaker
 
05:42:38.990 --> 05:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
um we have Ice Age let me set this up a
 
05:42:40.128 --> 05:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
little bit if you feel indulge me we
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
have ice ages uh historically the four
 
05:42:45.470 --> 05:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
major ice ages including one not that
 
05:42:48.830 --> 05:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
long ago so climate is cyclical I
 
05:42:50.990 --> 05:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
obviously we have ice ages from time to
 
05:42:52.190 --> 05:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
time then it gets warmer now the
 
05:42:53.930 --> 05:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
man-made part of it this is what we're
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
wrestling with so but my the question
 
05:42:59.810 --> 05:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pause it to you uh has to
 
05:43:01.730 --> 05:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
do you mentioned several times global
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
warming you just mentioned a half
 
05:43:06.470 --> 05:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
Celsius increased uh in 1816 this is
 
05:43:09.230 --> 05:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
even before me or representative
 
05:43:13.010 --> 05:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
shirtliff around he he may probably cold
 
05:43:14.948 --> 05:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
winter yes okay
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
exactly okay so representative Sterling
 
05:43:18.590 --> 05:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
for members knows where I'm going with
 
05:43:20.750 --> 05:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
this there was a huge volcanic eruption
 
05:43:24.110 --> 05:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
in Indonesia uh cloud of the skies and
 
05:43:26.030 --> 05:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
is representative just pointed out it
 
05:43:27.948 --> 05:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
snowed every month and for a couple
 
05:43:30.770 --> 05:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
years it was uh terribly cold here in
 
05:43:32.330 --> 05:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
fact that's why so many people get the
 
05:43:34.610 --> 05:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
heck out if I can say that they got the
 
05:43:36.050 --> 05:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
heck out of New Hampshire because they
 
05:43:38.208 --> 05:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
couldn't farm and they just went that's
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
historical fact and so a Krakatoa type
 
05:43:46.070 --> 05:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh ex seismic cataclysmic volcanic
 
05:43:48.708 --> 05:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
disruption that or asteroids have caused
 
05:43:51.128 --> 05:43:51.138 align:start position:0%
these ice ages my question to you is
 
05:43:54.650 --> 05:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
given that these major seismic
 
05:43:56.990 --> 05:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
cataclysmic volcanic disruptions that
 
05:43:58.430 --> 05:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
will darken the sky and lower the
 
05:44:00.350 --> 05:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
temperatures probably will happen again
 
05:44:03.948 --> 05:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
if it's true and I let's say everything
 
05:44:06.770 --> 05:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
you say is absolutely true the global
 
05:44:08.090 --> 05:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
warming that you mentioned is happening
 
05:44:10.368 --> 05:44:10.378 align:start position:0%
is it possible that this global warming
 
05:44:12.730 --> 05:44:12.740 align:start position:0%
could mitigate the next uh
 
05:44:16.970 --> 05:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh traumatic uh volcanic uh disruption
 
05:44:21.650 --> 05:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
in in help us is is that possible
 
05:44:24.590 --> 05:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
um so we are we were in an a stage with
 
05:44:27.890 --> 05:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
for the last two million or so years
 
05:44:30.410 --> 05:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
um there's a glacial period of where
 
05:44:33.048 --> 05:44:33.058 align:start position:0%
this part of the world gets covered with
 
05:44:35.690 --> 05:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
ice and that lasts about 90 000 years
 
05:44:38.090 --> 05:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
and then there's an interglacial period
 
05:44:40.610 --> 05:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
of warming which lasts five or ten
 
05:44:42.650 --> 05:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
thousand years so we've been in this
 
05:44:46.250 --> 05:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
cycle for millions of years
 
05:44:46.260 --> 05:44:47.270 align:start position:0%
cycle for millions of years
um

05:44:47.270 --> 05:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:51.708 --> 05:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
so uh a couple years doesn't mean you're
 
05:44:53.390 --> 05:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
in an ice age
 
05:44:56.208 --> 05:44:56.218 align:start position:0%
um the science of what the forcings are
 
05:44:58.490 --> 05:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
on the Earth's energy balance to
 
05:45:00.170 --> 05:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
determine temperature is really
 
05:45:00.180 --> 05:45:01.548 align:start position:0%
determine temperature is really
interesting

05:45:01.548 --> 05:45:01.558 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
05:45:04.970 --> 05:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
um when a giant volcano blows up uh it
 
05:45:06.708 --> 05:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
produces amount enormous amounts of
 
05:45:08.990 --> 05:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
aerosols which shade the Earth and cause
 
05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
cooling for a couple years but then the
 
05:45:13.368 --> 05:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
particles drop back out of the
 
05:45:15.470 --> 05:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and the temperature goes back
 
05:45:18.288 --> 05:45:18.298 align:start position:0%
up we have natural variability all the
 
05:45:20.030 --> 05:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
time but we're not talking about that
 
05:45:21.890 --> 05:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
when we talk about climate you know
 
05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's weather we had a couple years of
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
cold weather the the climate is on a
 
05:45:29.090 --> 05:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
30-year time scale like what was the
 
05:45:31.190 --> 05:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
average of our weather for the last 30
 
05:45:32.930 --> 05:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
years so that's what we're talking about
 
05:45:34.610 --> 05:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
what's warming
 
05:45:34.620 --> 05:45:36.048 align:start position:0%
what's warming
um

05:45:36.048 --> 05:45:36.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:38.930 --> 05:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
we know the world is warming because of
 
05:45:40.490 --> 05:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
our pollution
 
05:45:43.070 --> 05:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
um we could get hit by an asteroid or a
 
05:45:45.288 --> 05:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
giant volcano could erupt and change our
 
05:45:47.930 --> 05:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
weather for a couple years but after a
 
05:45:50.390 --> 05:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
couple years we'll get back to the
 
05:45:52.910 --> 05:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
energy we're not in an energy balance
 
05:45:54.410 --> 05:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
where we have an energy imbalance
 
05:45:55.788 --> 05:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
because we've been adding so many
 
05:45:58.190 --> 05:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases to the air and carbon
 
05:45:59.868 --> 05:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
dioxide stays up there for hundreds or
 
05:46:03.048 --> 05:46:03.058 align:start position:0%
thousands of years we are going to get
 
05:46:04.310 --> 05:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
back to this temperature in a couple
 
05:46:06.948 --> 05:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
years because the Earth you know comes
 
05:46:08.510 --> 05:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
back to an equilibrium
 
05:46:10.610 --> 05:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
kind of scientists say we're going to
 
05:46:12.170 --> 05:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
warm for another two or three decades
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we've wormed since 1900
 
05:46:17.690 --> 05:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
about one degree Celsius globally this
 
05:46:19.430 --> 05:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
is taking an enormous amount of energy
 
05:46:22.850 --> 05:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
it's like something like 400 000
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
um Hiroshima size atomic bombs worth of
 
05:46:26.750 --> 05:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
energy every day is getting added to
 
05:46:28.670 --> 05:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
that your system because of our
 
05:46:31.010 --> 05:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases it's warming the oceans
 
05:46:33.170 --> 05:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
it's warming the land
 
05:46:35.930 --> 05:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
um this is a long-term Trend and so when
 
05:46:38.030 --> 05:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
we stop polluting it's not going to get
 
05:46:39.530 --> 05:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
back to normal we're going to warm for
 
05:46:41.930 --> 05:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
another two or three decades rapidly
 
05:46:43.610 --> 05:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
like we are now and then it's going to
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
start to you know level off but we can't
 
05:46:49.430 --> 05:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
stop polluting completely immediately we
 
05:46:50.930 --> 05:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to need fossil fuels for
 
05:46:53.868 --> 05:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
decades so what we need to do is come up
 
05:46:57.048 --> 05:46:57.058 align:start position:0%
with targets to reduce emissions by that
 
05:46:59.390 --> 05:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
will let us meet you know kind of Max
 
05:47:01.930 --> 05:47:01.940 align:start position:0%
temperature goals that's where 50
 
05:47:05.750 --> 05:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
emission reductions by 2030 and fit and
 
05:47:08.270 --> 05:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
Net Zero by 2050 come from that would
 
05:47:09.948 --> 05:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
let us hold warming to one and a half
 
05:47:11.868 --> 05:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
degrees which is a half degrees warmer
 
05:47:14.030 --> 05:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
than we have right now but it's a much
 
05:47:16.910 --> 05:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
safer future than if we go for another
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 years before we get serious and
 
05:47:23.090 --> 05:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
and finally reduce our carbon emissions
 
05:47:26.390 --> 05:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for that other questions
 
05:47:28.610 --> 05:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh thank you Mr Gates I
 
05:47:30.048 --> 05:47:30.058 align:start position:0%
think we got our money's worth out of
 
05:47:31.788 --> 05:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your time and

05:48:20.690 --> 05:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
all that
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
um so forgive me for any mistakes first
 
05:48:25.548 --> 05:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
of all I would just like to thank this
 
05:48:27.350 --> 05:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee for your time in hearing this
 
05:48:28.970 --> 05:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
incredibly important bill
 
05:48:28.980 --> 05:48:30.350 align:start position:0%
incredibly important bill
foreign

05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:48:32.448 --> 05:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
I strongly encourage this community to
 
05:48:34.368 --> 05:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of house concurrent
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
resolution 5 to call on New Hampshire's
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
governor and attorney general to step up
 
05:48:41.208 --> 05:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
for granted seders and pursue legal
 
05:48:43.250 --> 05:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
action against the companies that have
 
05:48:44.868 --> 05:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
profited off the pollution of our
 
05:48:44.878 --> 05:48:46.548 align:start position:0%
profited off the pollution of our
atmosphere

05:48:46.548 --> 05:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
atmosphere
 
05:48:49.010 --> 05:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel energy companies such as
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
Exxon Mobil shell Chevron and countless
 
05:48:54.470 --> 05:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
others have spent decades denying the
 
05:48:56.510 --> 05:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
effects of burning fossil fuels and the
 
05:48:58.128 --> 05:48:58.138 align:start position:0%
consequences of global climate change
 
05:49:00.170 --> 05:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
that the burning of these fossil fuels
 
05:49:02.448 --> 05:49:02.458 align:start position:0%
has and will create
 
05:49:04.910 --> 05:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned by previous speakers as
 
05:49:07.250 --> 05:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
early as the 1970s there was a
 
05:49:09.708 --> 05:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
scientific consensus that that emitting
 
05:49:12.230 --> 05:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
CO2 in the atmosphere would both
 
05:49:14.628 --> 05:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
increase global temperatures and also
 
05:49:17.810 --> 05:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
create uh unmitigated uh climate climate
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
change that we cannot fully predict
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that CO2 when emitted into the
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
atmosphere creates warming through a
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
greenhouse effect has been documented
 
05:49:30.650 --> 05:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
and known since as early as the 19th
 
05:49:33.590 --> 05:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
century right after the beginning of the
 
05:49:35.570 --> 05:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
Industrial Revolution of which the
 
05:49:37.128 --> 05:49:37.138 align:start position:0%
consequences we are currently dealing
 
05:49:37.138 --> 05:49:40.628 align:start position:0%
consequences we are currently dealing
with

05:49:40.628 --> 05:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
through the through the release of
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
internal emails and reports it has been
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
made public that not only did fossil
 
05:49:50.208 --> 05:49:50.218 align:start position:0%
fuel companies in the 70s and 80s know
 
05:49:51.890 --> 05:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:49:54.470 --> 05:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
results of their business practices were
 
05:49:56.810 --> 05:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
creating significant significant global
 
05:49:59.150 --> 05:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
warming and climate change but despite
 
05:50:01.910 --> 05:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
this they worked to cover cover up the
 
05:50:04.368 --> 05:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
consequences of their business practices
 
05:50:07.368 --> 05:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
over the last 30 and 40 years they've
 
05:50:09.110 --> 05:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
spent billions of dollars hiring
 
05:50:11.570 --> 05:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
lobbyists funding think tanks founding
 
05:50:14.330 --> 05:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
industry groups all to work to deny the
 
05:50:16.490 --> 05:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
mounting pile of evidence that we need
 
05:50:18.770 --> 05:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
to stop burning fossil fuels in order to
 
05:50:20.330 --> 05:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
avert climate
 
05:50:24.288 --> 05:50:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:26.090 --> 05:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
through those released documents and
 
05:50:28.910 --> 05:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
emails we knew that their own internal
 
05:50:31.310 --> 05:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
experts and scientists were creating
 
05:50:34.128 --> 05:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
prediction models and and reports that
 
05:50:36.830 --> 05:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
were basically in line with the results
 
05:50:39.170 --> 05:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
being produced by the scientists who
 
05:50:41.110 --> 05:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
were on the outside calling for
 
05:50:43.850 --> 05:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
reductions in burning fossil fuels so
 
05:50:45.410 --> 05:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
essentially they knew what they were
 
05:50:47.330 --> 05:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
doing and they proceeded to lie anyway
 
05:50:50.030 --> 05:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
that is also revealed in the in the
 
05:50:51.410 --> 05:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
internal documents they came forward
 
05:50:54.470 --> 05:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
like with the the tobacco companies they
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
knew what they were doing they were
 
05:50:57.590 --> 05:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
intentionally lying and misleading the
 
05:51:00.110 --> 05:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
public governments and regulatory
 
05:51:03.110 --> 05:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
agencies in the service of their of
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:09.650 --> 05:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
the perpetrators of this massive public
 
05:51:11.750 --> 05:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
fraud and cover-up are some of the
 
05:51:13.970 --> 05:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
biggest and most profitable companies in
 
05:51:15.948 --> 05:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
America and around the world
 
05:51:17.930 --> 05:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
they're worth trillions of dollars and
 
05:51:20.330 --> 05:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
have tens of billions uh in profit every
 
05:51:22.430 --> 05:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
year they have become unimaginably
 
05:51:24.890 --> 05:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
wealthy and Powerful off the backs of
 
05:51:27.410 --> 05:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
the regular people both in this state in
 
05:51:29.270 --> 05:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
this country and around the world that
 
05:51:32.030 --> 05:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
they have lied to and misled
 
05:51:35.110 --> 05:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
with every uh passing with every passing
 
05:51:38.690 --> 05:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
summer with every mild winter it becomes
 
05:51:40.910 --> 05:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
more and more obvious that we are living
 
05:51:44.448 --> 05:51:44.458 align:start position:0%
in a climate crisis there are once New
 
05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
Generation floods that happen numerous
 
05:51:48.650 --> 05:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
times throughout living memory there are
 
05:51:50.270 --> 05:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
winters in which there isn't a
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
significant snowstorm until mid-January
 
05:51:54.350 --> 05:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
there are summer just just this summer
 
05:51:56.810 --> 05:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
we we set a state record for the hottest
 
05:51:59.390 --> 05:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
day of the year we can we are we seeing
 
05:52:01.548 --> 05:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
and living through the results of this
 
05:52:04.128 --> 05:52:04.138 align:start position:0%
climate change and as we as we do know
 
05:52:06.230 --> 05:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
that these are these effects are only
 
05:52:09.170 --> 05:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
going to continue and accelerate in
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
their intensity
 
05:52:13.788 --> 05:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
this is why it is crucial for this state
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
government for our attorney general to
 
05:52:18.288 --> 05:52:18.298 align:start position:0%
join with the Coalition of other states
 
05:52:21.770 --> 05:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
Attorneys General to go after to uh to
 
05:52:24.110 --> 05:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
go after these companies not only for
 
05:52:27.170 --> 05:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
you know punitive uh recompensation but
 
05:52:28.970 --> 05:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
to also take the money that they have
 
05:52:30.948 --> 05:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
the the unimaginable amounts of money
 
05:52:33.470 --> 05:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
that they have raised and and made off
 
05:52:35.930 --> 05:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
of this this public fraud and to take it
 
05:52:37.910 --> 05:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
back to recoup some of those those
 
05:52:41.390 --> 05:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
profits to use them to do the things
 
05:52:43.310 --> 05:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
that we are going to need to in the next
 
05:52:45.350 --> 05:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the coming decades to deal with the
 
05:52:47.270 --> 05:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
climate crisis
 
05:52:49.548 --> 05:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
although this will be a crisis of
 
05:52:52.250 --> 05:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
massive Glo and Global proportions there
 
05:52:54.350 --> 05:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
are solutions there are things that can
 
05:52:56.208 --> 05:52:56.218 align:start position:0%
be done to protect people and strengthen
 
05:52:58.610 --> 05:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
communities making investments in
 
05:53:00.650 --> 05:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
systems and in infrastructure will
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
dampen the most harmful impacts and we
 
05:53:05.150 --> 05:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
can choose to protect those who will not
 
05:53:07.190 --> 05:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
be able to protect themselves which we
 
05:53:09.288 --> 05:53:09.298 align:start position:0%
absolutely need to do because that will
 
05:53:11.868 --> 05:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
be all of us
 
05:53:15.110 --> 05:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
I I won't go into any any of the facts
 
05:53:16.970 --> 05:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
that I have prepared because my the
 
05:53:18.170 --> 05:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have done a much
 
05:53:20.810 --> 05:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
better job of laying out the scientific
 
05:53:23.330 --> 05:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
and you know technical reasons for this
 
05:53:26.270 --> 05:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
the the need for this bill so I'll just
 
05:53:28.250 --> 05:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
tell a little bit of a personal story to
 
05:53:30.590 --> 05:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments my father's
 
05:53:32.510 --> 05:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
birthday is coming up in a couple of
 
05:53:34.490 --> 05:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
weeks and I mentioned that uh because
 
05:53:37.490 --> 05:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
you'll be turning 54. so he was born in
 
05:53:41.510 --> 05:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
1969 which means he was a young teenager
 
05:53:43.850 --> 05:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
during the early and mid 80s when the
 
05:53:45.890 --> 05:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
decisions by these fossil fuel companies
 
05:53:48.350 --> 05:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
to perpetrate this massive public fraud
 
05:53:51.650 --> 05:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
was being made and right now my youngest
 
05:53:54.590 --> 05:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
brother is 16 years old which means that
 
05:53:58.670 --> 05:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
this this cover-up has been going on for
 
05:54:00.890 --> 05:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
an entire generation in the time that it
 
05:54:04.610 --> 05:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
take my father to grow up to to to go to
 
05:54:06.650 --> 05:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
college to start a business to raise a
 
05:54:06.660 --> 05:54:07.610 align:start position:0%
college to start a business to raise a
family

05:54:07.610 --> 05:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:54:09.770 --> 05:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
all of this has been done in that time
 
05:54:12.708 --> 05:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
and I really don't want to in another 30
 
05:54:15.530 --> 05:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
or 40 years look back and say that that
 
05:54:18.350 --> 05:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
we're also we were still unable to to do
 
05:54:20.330 --> 05:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
anything about it to to fix the problems
 
05:54:22.730 --> 05:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
that have been caused by fossil fuel
 
05:54:24.890 --> 05:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
companies and to to do something about
 
05:54:27.048 --> 05:54:27.058 align:start position:0%
it so to conclude my statement I would
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
like to again strongly encourage this
 
05:54:31.070 --> 05:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
committee to vote in favor of this
 
05:54:37.070 --> 05:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:38.750 --> 05:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
would you take any questions if they're
 
05:54:40.490 --> 05:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
already gladly
 
05:54:42.530 --> 05:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
good practice for a few budding
 
05:54:45.110 --> 05:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
lobbyists representative gagne
 
05:54:47.090 --> 05:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:54:49.070 --> 05:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question actually it's more of
 
05:54:51.470 --> 05:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
a comment excellent presentation thank
 
05:54:53.708 --> 05:54:53.718 align:start position:0%

05:54:56.270 --> 05:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
what school are you going to or did you
 
05:54:58.490 --> 05:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
go what high school

see none thank you for your testimony
 
05:55:25.850 --> 05:55:25.860 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else here who'd like to
 
05:55:28.548 --> 05:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
speak on this measure
 
05:55:31.368 --> 05:55:31.378 align:start position:0%
and not saying anything I will
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
close this here and we have one more
 
05:55:36.530 --> 05:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
hearing uh coming up at 3 30 in just a
 
05:55:38.990 --> 05:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
couple minutes as I said before uh I've
 
05:55:41.150 --> 05:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
communicated with the ranking member and
 
05:55:42.948 --> 05:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
we've identified a couple measures that
 
05:55:45.230 --> 05:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
we think we can execially uh very
 
05:55:48.350 --> 05:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
quickly well we have a quorum so before
 
05:55:52.368 --> 05:55:52.378 align:start position:0%
you we'll have in the prime sponsor for
 
05:55:54.470 --> 05:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
the final resolution is not here and I
 
05:55:55.850 --> 05:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
believe we're upside if you're going to
 
05:55:57.048 --> 05:55:57.058 align:start position:0%
introduce it
 
05:55:59.448 --> 05:55:59.458 align:start position:0%
so representative shirtleff in just a
 
05:56:01.190 --> 05:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
moment we'll introduce the final measure
 
05:56:04.250 --> 05:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
of the day and then we'll see how much
 
05:56:05.930 --> 05:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
comment there is on that and then again
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
if if uh if you wouldn't mind standing
 
05:56:10.010 --> 05:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
for just a very brief time I think we
 
05:56:12.470 --> 05:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
can exact uh two measures very quickly
 
05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
that we seem to have consensus on get
 
05:56:16.190 --> 05:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
them on the consent calendar and then
 
05:56:21.288 --> 05:56:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:23.930 --> 05:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
oh I was looking at 3 30. okay uh yes so
 
05:56:25.490 --> 05:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
introducing the final measure which is
 
05:56:28.910 --> 05:56:28.920 align:start position:0%

um because we don't have anybody to to
 
05:57:39.708 --> 05:57:39.718 align:start position:0%

05:57:42.410 --> 05:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
move it to another day
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
uh actually we have opened the hearing
 
05:57:47.090 --> 05:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
on this I I could recess this and come
 
05:57:48.530 --> 05:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
back to it
 
05:57:50.810 --> 05:57:50.820 align:start position:0%

space force Oh wrong one okay
 
06:01:28.788 --> 06:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh well it's it's part of the military
 
06:01:31.368 --> 06:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
so it should be included
 
06:01:34.250 --> 06:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
on its own just like the the air air
 
06:01:37.128 --> 06:01:37.138 align:start position:0%
force was from the Army Air corps it
 
06:01:41.150 --> 06:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
became the Air Force and this
 
06:01:42.770 --> 06:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
it's like a Marine Corps as part of the
 
06:01:44.330 --> 06:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
Navy Department there
 
06:01:47.208 --> 06:01:47.218 align:start position:0%
it's not the same thing it's under the
 
06:01:48.830 --> 06:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
Navy Department it's it's not
 
06:01:50.628 --> 06:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily part of the Navy department
 
06:01:53.868 --> 06:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
but uh the point was made earlier the
 
06:01:56.330 --> 06:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
point is is that sure I should have kept
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:05.930 --> 06:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:09.170 --> 06:02:09.180 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman I recommend that goes on the
 
06:03:43.548 --> 06:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
consent calendar unless represent Finney
 
06:03:46.430 --> 06:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh prefers that it doesn't
 
06:03:48.110 --> 06:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
um if I could just speak to my to my
 
06:03:49.368 --> 06:03:49.378 align:start position:0%
vote I only said no because I wasn't
 
06:03:51.530 --> 06:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
here for the for the testimony so I
 
06:03:53.030 --> 06:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
can't say yes if I didn't hear anything
 
06:03:58.250 --> 06:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:00.708 --> 06:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
can I do that no if you're present you
 
06:04:04.850 --> 06:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
must vote yeah okay okay before we close
 
06:04:07.190 --> 06:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh you do you do have an opportunity to
 
06:04:09.470 --> 06:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
check you can stay in your your Vote or
 
06:04:11.510 --> 06:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
change it but we have an option right
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
now before we close to do that so it's
 
06:04:14.628 --> 06:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
up to you
 
06:04:14.638 --> 06:04:15.770 align:start position:0%
up to you
okay

06:04:15.770 --> 06:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:04:15.780 --> 06:04:17.208 align:start position:0%
okay
um

06:04:17.208 --> 06:04:17.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:19.250 --> 06:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
this isn't like establishing a space for
 
06:04:21.288 --> 06:04:21.298 align:start position:0%
us it's just saying it just includes it
 
06:04:24.708 --> 06:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
oh okay I I'm sorry I missed this is why
 
06:04:26.270 --> 06:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
I needed to be here I'm sorry
 
06:04:28.850 --> 06:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
I could just share my perspective
 
06:04:31.368 --> 06:04:31.378 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a military person I'm an
 
06:04:32.570 --> 06:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
outsider so I have an outside
 
06:04:34.730 --> 06:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
perspective but one of the things that
 
06:04:36.350 --> 06:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
struck me in the testimony this
 
06:04:39.470 --> 06:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
afternoon was this would allow the
 
06:04:42.590 --> 06:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
members who serve this equivalent
 
06:04:45.110 --> 06:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
benefits of other members who are
 
06:04:47.570 --> 06:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
serving so they would all be treated the
 
06:04:50.990 --> 06:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
same okay and I currently we do have a
 
06:04:53.690 --> 06:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
space force in the state of New
 
06:04:55.548 --> 06:04:55.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I wouldn't want those
 
06:04:58.010 --> 06:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
members to be treated in terms of
 
06:05:00.170 --> 06:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
benefits housing Etc I'm just caring
 
06:05:02.690 --> 06:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
about this now and the others all right
 
06:05:10.190 --> 06:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%

you Mr chair
 
06:06:10.490 --> 06:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
um I think we got a pretty good
 
06:06:12.110 --> 06:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
understanding from the people that
 
06:06:14.208 --> 06:06:14.218 align:start position:0%
testified in that it's extremely
 
06:06:16.850 --> 06:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
important that we keep our numbers up in
 
06:06:19.490 --> 06:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
the National Guard and as they do a lot
 
06:06:21.288 --> 06:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
of things in the state as we've heard
 
06:06:22.850 --> 06:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
throughout the committee so anything
 
06:06:24.410 --> 06:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
that we can do to help them with the
 
06:06:26.690 --> 06:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
recruiting I think and I think this is
 
06:06:29.448 --> 06:06:29.458 align:start position:0%
an excellent idea as a starting point to
 
06:06:31.430 --> 06:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
help them try to get closer to their
 
06:06:31.440 --> 06:06:34.430 align:start position:0%
help them try to get closer to their
numbers

06:06:34.430 --> 06:06:34.440 align:start position:0%

06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
that this be placed in the consent
 
06:08:16.320 --> 06:08:17.390 align:start position:0%
that this be placed in the consent
calendar

06:08:17.390 --> 06:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
06:08:18.890 --> 06:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you all for yesterday
 
06:08:23.150 --> 06:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:24.890 --> 06:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
could you explain to the Freshman know
 
06:08:26.448 --> 06:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
and understand what the consent calendar
 
06:08:27.948 --> 06:08:27.958 align:start position:0%
is all about
 
06:08:30.830 --> 06:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
sure if there's any question that um if
 
06:08:33.410 --> 06:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
if a committee is we just did has
 
06:08:37.670 --> 06:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
unanimous unanimity or near unanimity uh
 
06:08:40.010 --> 06:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
on a bill it doesn't involve a financial
 
06:08:43.430 --> 06:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
note and I do notice that hb330 does
 
06:08:45.288 --> 06:08:45.298 align:start position:0%
have an FN
 
06:08:48.350 --> 06:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
um so we may need we may need to uh
 
06:08:51.410 --> 06:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
confirm whether or not we can we can put
 
06:08:54.350 --> 06:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
that on consent if so that's something
 
06:08:56.510 --> 06:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
we'll follow up on but uh definitely on
 
06:08:59.448 --> 06:08:59.458 align:start position:0%
206 that will be on consent meaning all
 
06:09:02.110 --> 06:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
the bills that the Committees are
 
06:09:05.750 --> 06:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
unanimous on uh go on a calendar and
 
06:09:09.110 --> 06:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
they're voted on mass uh as a block of
 
06:09:11.570 --> 06:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
however many there are now in the past
 
06:09:14.990 --> 06:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
any any member could ask or pull a bill
 
06:09:17.030 --> 06:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
off of the consent calendar bring it to
 
06:09:20.270 --> 06:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
the floor for a debate and a vote we
 
06:09:22.910 --> 06:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
have changed the rules uh this time
 
06:09:25.070 --> 06:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
around so in order to pull a bill off
 
06:09:27.470 --> 06:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar rather than just
 
06:09:29.208 --> 06:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
have one per person do it you would need
 
06:09:32.270 --> 06:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
to we no need to have tent that is a new
 
06:09:35.270 --> 06:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
rule for better for worse so if any of
 
06:09:38.090 --> 06:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
you if you did see a bill not
 
06:09:39.288 --> 06:09:39.298 align:start position:0%
necessarily from this committee but if
 
06:09:41.330 --> 06:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
you saw a bill on on consent Connell you
 
06:09:43.910 --> 06:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
thought deserve to be debated on the
 
06:09:45.170 --> 06:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
floor you would need to find nine other
 
06:09:47.390 --> 06:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
people and and get the names to the
 
06:09:49.430 --> 06:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
clerk and then it would go to the floor
 
06:09:51.230 --> 06:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
is that explain it
 
06:09:53.330 --> 06:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
fairly well hopefully
 
06:10:01.510 --> 06:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:04.368 --> 06:10:04.378 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins well and and I
 
06:10:06.170 --> 06:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
will we'll get that we'll get that done
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
I want to sit down together sure we'll
 
06:10:10.610 --> 06:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
