00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
ready to go ahead with HB
 
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
651 this is Bill modifying the base cost
 
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
and differentiated cost of an adequate
 
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
education prior that I have just two
 
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
notices for the committee committee
 
00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
members if you're parking your vehicle
 
00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
in a place that shouldn't be parked
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
other words if you're seeing one of the
 
00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
yellow covers that goes on the parking
 
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
meters out out there and you think well
 
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's open to anybody's in in the uh
 
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
house you're wrong it's open to those
 
00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 align:start position:0%
which that place has been assigned to
 
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're usually handicapped or have
 
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
medical conditions where they have to be
 
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
close by so do not do that I've been
 
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
told that you're going to be immediately
 
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
informed and regardless of what we're
 
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
doing here you're going to be pulled out
 
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have to go move that
 
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
car so just a word of advice be careful
 
00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
the other one is if you're going to be
 
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
eating anything in that other room we
 
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
had a large spot last night which was a
 
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
stain on the carpet if you accidentally
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
spill something I have no problem with
 
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we just got to get to the uh people
 
00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
are custodians and have it cleaned up so
 
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't settle in and it's very
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to get out so those just a
 
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
couple quick notices um I think but we
 
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
also have a fiscal note on this a
 
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
revised fiscal note on 651 it's going to
 
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
be delivered here in a few moments uh
 
00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
but I at to begin with I'd like to uh
 
00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 align:start position:0%
welcome represent luno to our committee
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
and uh he will be presenting the
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
bill welcome thank you very much Mr
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
chair members of the uh committee for
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
the record uh Dave luno uh representing
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
the people of Hopkinson and Bo and all
 
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
across the United all across the state
 
00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and um and uh and it's
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
a a a a delight for me to be here this
 
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
morning to introduce House Bill 651 so
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
651 is um is uh very similar to um to
 
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
Bill that we introduced last week House
 
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 550 and it's part of a package of
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
um of of public school funding bills
 
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be bringing on and
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh and looking forward to uh to getting
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
them introduce and getting them into a
 
00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
work session so that we can really uh
 
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
really uh dig into this um
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
um unlike 550 I should say Let me let me
 
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
say it this way um 651 Builds on what we
 
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
talked about last week in House Bill 550
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
it includes a an increase to the base
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education based on
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
the um the ruling in the um uh in the
 
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
conal suit but it also
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
um increases the uh the differentiated
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
Aid costs that are um that that that are
 
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
part of our current um school funding
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
formula and that are that are included
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
in the in the r and case which is um
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
which is still this part of it is still
 
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
in the um in the lower in the in the
 
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
trial court so so um let's talk a little
 
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
bit about what U what um what the Rand
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
case is about so the Rand case is about
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
fairness it's about equity and um and
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's about fairness for
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because what it uh what it
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
what it includes is uh it prohibits um
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
um swept the state wide education
 
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
property tax discount or rebates uh it's
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
also includes fairness for students so
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
it recognizes the additional educational
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
cost uh based on student characteristics
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
and um you know I think most people
 
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
around around you know the committee
 
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
table here you know recognizes that
 
00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
special education certainly comes with
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
it additional costs on a per student
 
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
basis but there are other factors too
 
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
which have a strong correlation to cost
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
so um so students or percentages of
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
students that come from lowincome
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and the way we measure that
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is through the number
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
of students or the percentage of
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
students in any school district that um
 
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
um that that uh take part in the free
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
and reduced price lunch program so we
 
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
use free and reduced price lunch as a
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
proxy for um uh for for low income but
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
there's other ways to do it too I mean
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
you could look at at Medicaid Direct
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
certific I think there's going to be a
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
bill on that later on today and that's
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that's also allowed at
 
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
the federal level to to be used as a uh
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
as a proxy for for low income another um
 
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
characteristic student characteristic
 
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
that um that
 
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
that that basically has costs associated
 
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
with it are um are students that that
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
don't have English is their first
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
language so English language Learners
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
and um and you know in a lot of
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
districts around the state there aren't
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
many elll students um in those districts
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
but uh but in districts like Manchester
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
and NASA I mean I I hear about how
 
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
Manchester has has students that speak I
 
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
think over 70 different uh different
 
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
language and that certainly imposes
 
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
challenges on the district as far as
 
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
providing an opportunity for an adequate
 
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
education for these students um but
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
there's um there's other factors that uh
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
that can be relevant to um um you know
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
to to to student specific costs that um
 
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh that could be that could be used they
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
just hope it they just aren't collected
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
Education today so they're not at our
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
disposal to um uh to do but as we
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
consider these school funding bills and
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
consider what sort of equity factors we
 
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
want to uh we want to include down the
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
road we may want to begin collecting
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
collecting data um that uh that that
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
helps us provide um you know Equitable
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
funding for for um for kids across the
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
state so
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
um so what what's included in the bill
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
everybody's got a copy of it and I think
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes coming I'll be talking
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit um the top part
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
of it on line um line seven uh is the
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
same as what we talked about last week
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 550 it um it increases the
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
the state share uh of a cost of
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
inadequate education from $4,100 to
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
$735 1 cent um uh 651 adds increases to
 
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
the three differentiated um costs U so
 
00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
the the the Equitable factors that that
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
flow into our um adequacy formula so for
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
free indu Price lunch soxy for for low
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
income uh students who are English
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
language Learners and um peoples who are
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
receiving special education services and
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
then the um the last thing it does and
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
we did this in 550 as well um had a
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's a modification to 193 e2b U uh
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph one to add the necessary
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
specific resource elements so that as
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
base cost get recalculated every every
 
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
so often that um that it it factors in
 
00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
the uh the specific elements that the U
 
00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
that that the con that the judge and
 
00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:00.519 align:start position:0%
conval put in in that order uh but what
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
it uh what it does not do what what 651
 
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
does not do and um and probably uh
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
probably should take a look at it is um
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
is is what are these Equitable factors
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
what are these Equitable um
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
characteristics that uh that should be
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
costed out and put into our formula and
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
um obviously we haven't seen the order
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
in Rand yet um as it pertains to this
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
but as we go into our work sessions
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully this committee will be able
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
toh to take a look at some of these
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
things so
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
um so let's see uh we talked about um
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
651 being a package of the school
 
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
funding bills and um and reviewing them
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
real quickly we talked about uh what we
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
what we introduced last week House Bill
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
550 it's a flat funding formula so it's
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
uh just changes the base the base
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant every school district in
 
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
the state gets that base ad adequacy
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
grant for every um every student um in
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
District uh House Bill 651 we now
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
introduce the equity component in there
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
so it recognizes differentiable
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
differentiated or Equitable costs that
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
not every student has has the same
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
degree of um of of of cost maybe said a
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
different way different students with
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
different characteristics provoke um um
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
impose uh different challenges on a
 
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
school district in terms of education so
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
651 one introduces equity and then um uh
 
00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:34.519 align:start position:0%
bill that we'll talk about soon uh I
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
think it just received the bill number
 
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
and and is now in this committee uh
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
we'll uh we'll go One Step Beyond that
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
and begin to look at taxpayer equity and
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
basically Fair uh access to resources
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
and it's part of the foundation
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity plan and um and that one
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
really breaks us out finally out of this
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
one siiz fits-all uh method of um of
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
funding schools so all of these all
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
these methods are talked about in the
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
2020 school funding report and gets into
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
all of them in in considerable uh detail
 
00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.629 align:start position:0%
all of them in in considerable uh detail
so

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
um let's get into the fiscal did the
 
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note come around we have them
 
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
okay so um so
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
the the the current um the current
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
formula for for State funding uh for
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
public schools so this is the state
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
share of funding Public Schools so uh
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
300 63 million come from the Statewide
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
education property tax an additional
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
$717 million come from other nons swept
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources so this this comes comes
 
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
from the um from the state coffers for
 
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
total of um of of $1 b80 million and
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's current um school funding
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 550 what we did last week
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
increases that by approximately $454
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
million so the swep stays the same 363
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
million um the the direct funding
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
adequacy grants to school districts
 
00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
increases from 717 million to um uh to
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
$171 million so that's the $454 million
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
increase House Bill
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
651 uh increases that I'm looking at my
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
numbers not necessarily the actually but
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're right on the same
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
increases it by another 570 I'm sorry
 
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
increases above current U by 576 million
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
so an increase uh it's U uh leaves swept
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
the same uh total direct ad adequacy
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
Grant of 1,293 million uh for a total
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
State share of
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
$1.65 billion which is um which is
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
getting close to 50% of what what what
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
we spend all all all in on public
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
schools in the state so largely driven
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
by local property uh taxpayers but also
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh a couple hundred million in federal
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
grants and then the um uh and then the
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
state Grant so so starting to approach
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 651 uh to a u to to
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
almost a 50% um you know 45 to 50% share
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
of um of school funding we're not
 
00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:26.839 align:start position:0%
looking to increase um uh how much we
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
spend Statewide on public schools just
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
increased the state share uh of that and
 
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit Pro provide some
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
Sub sub substantial release relief for
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers um I think the uh the
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and again I haven't I
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
haven't gone through it it does um talk
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
about the cascading effect to Charter
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
Schools and um and vouchers so that is
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
um uh is in here and
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
um and anyway I uh look forward to uh to
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
taking any questions but I really look
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
forward to this heading into a uh a work
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
session with all of our school funding
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
bills so that we can really you know
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
shake them down and and uh and and and
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
see what works for the people in New
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you very much uh rep
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
luno and um we understand this is a
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
sequence a part of all the bills which
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
you you you know put together here and
 
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
it's they'll come back thank you no I
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
appre I appreciate that Mr and I
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that the the order
 
00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
that these are being introduced because
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
they build they do build on each other
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
yes I understand representa papit do you
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you Mr chair I
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
have two but I'll start with one and ask
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
for your permission for the second one
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for U my opportunity
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
to ask questions and thank you to my
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
colleague for
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
testifying I'm only in my second term so
 
00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:50.759 align:start position:0%
I still have a lot to learn here can you
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
share any scientific studies that show
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
that educating lowincome students is
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
more expensive and show by how much yes
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
we actually do have them they're they're
 
00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
they're actually summarized in the
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
report and there's copies of the report
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
in the in the office but also there are
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
um there are specific subject matter
 
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
studies that are on the um the the
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
school funding commission's website
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
which is hosted by the Cary School UNH
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
and there's about um um a dozen or so uh
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
research papers based on new H using New
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's specific data but also
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
leaning on um on studies that the
 
00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
American Institutes of research thank
 
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
you and Mr chair may ask my second thank
 
00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
you question um you mentioned additional
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
funding forl I was wondering if you have
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
a thought on what should be the maximum
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
number of years we give to a school
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
district to bring a kid up to speed on
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
the English language so the ESL bumping
 
00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
funding is no longer needed yeah I'm I'm
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
not an expert in that area I think it's
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
a great um a very good question though
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
um but um but I'm I'm not I'm not equi
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I appreciate it
 
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
further questions from from the
 
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
committee uh yes
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
representan thank you for bringing this
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
and thank you thank you Mr chairman um I
 
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions if it's all
 
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959 align:start position:0%
right real quick both in line with each
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
other the first one is why is the
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
greatest amount of differentiated Aid
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
given to free and reduced lunch and not
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
to special ad when special ad has such
 
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
an incredible cost so thank you very
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
much for the question um what um uh uh
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
the way the way we we did it 651 is we
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
just provided the same scaling factor
 
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
from from the base to the to the conv
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
Val base and we applied that to our
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
existing differentiated Aid factors so
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
in fact while the while the numbers are
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
different um it it's still the the um
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
the free in reduced price lunch uh would
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
still be greater than special education
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
as it is in our current Formula okay the
 
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
second question is this is numbered by
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
residency or enrollment I'm I'm thinking
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is numbered by enrollment there
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
what are you talking about the numbers
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
are figured by enrollment the in the
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal note yes yeah th those are by
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
admr that's how that's calculated no the
 
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
entire the the entire program the the
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
this state um Grant would be given to
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
the schools according to the number
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
enrolled to the N to the the the the
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
um not to the number of students
 
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
enrolled it's to the admr um there there
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
is a difference between enrollment and
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
and admr so all right average daily
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
membership in
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
residents all right thank you yeah
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
further questions represent
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
Burton thank you Mr chairman uh to
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
relate this back to previous testimony
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh about the preparedness of students
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
and the difference in where they come
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
from we can go back to the do you have a
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
question yeah I do okay does does the
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard about the number of
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
students is showing up at community
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
colleges uh needing developmental math
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
developmental English we call it uh many
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
coming from the lower income towns does
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
that give evidence that this part of the
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
process of education at the secondary
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
level if it's not adequate shows up when
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
they when they show up for Workforce
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
training community colleges and other
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
yeah no that's a that's a really good
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
observation U represent Burton and um
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
and again that's something that's um
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
that's talked about quite qu quite at
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
length uh in here with a very very
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
strong correlation between student
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
outcomes and um and and uh family income
 
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
where that where that student um lives
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
and actually um and actually overall
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
school funding um in those uh in those
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
districts so so so you know it's
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
important and our current funding
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
formula actually recognizes that um that
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
students from from lowincome uh
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and districts that have
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
large large numbers of students and
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
low-income backgrounds uh actually
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
require additional additional funding if
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
you want to improve their outcomes and
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
have the outcomes more in line with with
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide outcomes which are among the
 
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
best of the best in the country so uh so
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
even the new um the new um um uh the new
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
Equitable Grant the extraordinary needs
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
Grant recognizes um recognizes that um
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
Dynamic further questions from the
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing you thank you very
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much Mr chair uh
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
Shen good morning uh my name is Zach
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
Shen I'm the executive director of the
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school funding fairness
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
project uh we're here in support of
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
651 um as representative luno mentioned
 
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
a little bit in his uh introducing of
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
the bill you know this kind of is a a
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
building on um house B 550 and some of
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony that was heard last week
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
on that the main difference being the
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
addition of the differentiated Aid
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
categories um and just to provide a
 
00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
little more context about why this is an
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
important shift um that goes both in
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
line with some of the conv Val rulings
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
and Decades of of work to try to shift
 
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
some of the um cost from local property
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to the state again not
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
necessarily increasing total
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures overall but shifting who
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
pays uh right now um in New Hampshire uh
 
00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:47.559 align:start position:0%
about $2.7 billion of the total amount
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
we spend on education is uh picked up by
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayers about 70% of
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
all of our education spending for our
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
Public Schools is paid for by local
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers the largest
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
percentage in the country by quite a bit
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh on the flip side less than 20% um
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
year toe right about 20% of funding for
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
public education actually comes from the
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire through our
 
00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:12.039 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula and other Aid um
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
categories uh and that is the lowest
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
share in the country so on one hand
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
highest share comes from local property
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
taxes on the other hand lowest share
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
comes from the state uh and the Gap
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
there is largely um borne out in the
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula that we start to see um
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
being talked about in House Bill 651 uh
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
the state's providing uh just about
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
$5,200 $5,300 per student inadequacy
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
funding right saying this is an amount
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
of money you need to provide the cost of
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
adequate education for every K through2
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
student in the state while the actual
 
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799 align:start position:0%
average expenditure is O over
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
$22,000 so there's a significant Gap
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
there in what the state's providing and
 
00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:53.799 align:start position:0%
saying you can use that money to provide
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
an adequate education and what districts
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
all over the state are actually spending
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
um to to support their Public Schools uh
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
it has a huge impact on local property
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
tax rates which again is a big part of
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
this discussion by shifting some of the
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
share to the state we can provide more
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
relief for some districts who then could
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
reduce the property tax burn or at least
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
take the pressure off just one quick
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
example um in Kingston the equalized
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
school property tax rate that's swept
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
and and local is
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
$10.72 the expenditures um are
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
$24,600 uh per pupil uh in Hampton
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
almost the same exact expenditures
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
24,900 and yet the tax rate is about
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
half at
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
$615 and so we see kind of pretty
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
significant disparities around the state
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
largely based on property value and
 
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
hital 651 seeks to address some of these
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
inequities by increasing both the base
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
accuracy cost and some the
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid um one element of the
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
current uh differentiated Aid costs that
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
I want to point out is that they're not
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
actually based on any real data math
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
math actual need the numbers passed in
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
the last budget were perfectly round
 
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.789 align:start position:0%
the last budget were perfectly round
numbers

00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
$4,100 2,300 for special education 800
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
for elll 2100 for free introduced lunch
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
there were that was a compromise number
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
between the governor's budget The
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
house's budget the Senate's budget to to
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
pass the budget some of the numbers you
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
know that we see in the lawsuits are
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
based on significant amounts of data 5
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
years of a court case these are values
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
that have been dug into picked apart I
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
really encourage anyone um to look into
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
the rulings or the conval lawsuit as
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
filed for some of the rationale around
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
why they got to the numbers they did um
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
and why the judge ended up at the 73
 
00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:42.039 align:start position:0%
56 also just point out again that the
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
the state in the conval lawsuit right
 
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
provided absolutely no evidence over
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
five years that the
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
$4,100 was enough to provide an adequate
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
education there's no defense to that and
 
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
so really the question then is okay what
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
elements of the plaintiff's argument the
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
piece that they included that some of
 
00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
them are in House Bill 651 really should
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
be included in the cost of an adequate
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
education two last pieces one um is uh
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
that again to reiterate this is about
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
who is paying not necessarily increasing
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
costs um and that there has been
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
significant um conversation recently um
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
about some legislative leaders other
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
state leaders to to strip some local
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
control and kind kind of force some of
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
these cost shifts onto the Local
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
District you know saying we're going to
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
kind of either cut or reduce spending at
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
the local level instead of the state
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
taking a look at what it should provide
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
to help balance that out help make it
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
less lopsided at 70% and
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
20% um and I think that really the the
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
question is how much should the state be
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
picking up in order to provide that
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
relief to local property taxes the last
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
thing I want to point out I'm happy to
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
answer questions after um is just uh
 
00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
since this is building on house will 550
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
very similar Concepts I would really
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
encourage anyone if you want to look for
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
extra testimony or support there to look
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
back at the um the log for Hospital 550
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
188 people from 66 different communities
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
all over the state submitted written
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
testimony online for that bill um there
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
was almost 500 folks who signed in in
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
support um compared to the 11 who signed
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
in again so I just wanted to flag that
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
as the school funding bills sometimes if
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're not paid to be here right it's
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
hard to show up or testify in person or
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
even know how to track a bill and so
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's significant support um for that
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill last week and I hope that you kind
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
of bring that into the work sessions
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
around all these education funding bills
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
U and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
from yes
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you thank
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
so I have to say that um and yes this is
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
a question for the last seven years I
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
have been on my school board and every
 
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039 align:start position:0%
year at the annual meeting I've gotten
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
up and said
 
00:27:05.389 --> 00:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
listen New Hampshire is the lowest in
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
the country for State funding you need
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
to speak to your legislator legislator
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
about how we fund education in New
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now I am a legislator and this
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
is my
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
fight we are the lowest you if we would
 
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
you please have a question we want the
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
questions first folks oh okay sorry if
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
this were to happen do you know where
 
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
that would put us it's obviously not
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
going to raise us up into the like 90th
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
you know but do you know where it would
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
put us I think so what you're asking is
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
if we this bill were to go in place as
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
written where would it Place us as
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to last in the state for state
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
share funding I don't know that the top
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
of my head somewhere in the middle okay
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
right so I can get an exact data point
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
but definitely not catapulting to you
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
know first or second in the country it
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
would be somewhere in the middle thank
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
you y further questions represent
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
you again for being here and testifying
 
00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:06.519 align:start position:0%
on multiple bills um I just wanted to
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
understand in your opinion is the intent
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
of this bill to increase total funding
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
or just to keep school funding the same
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
and shift cost from the local
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
communities to the
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
state I think the intent of this bill is
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
to I mean it's increasing the state
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
share of
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
funding I can't predict exactly what
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
every single school district will do
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
with that increased funding I think a
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
lot of them would see that and be able
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
to pass on those cost savings the
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
additional funding as property tax
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
relief to their um to their constituents
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
to their communities I so I think the
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
intent is twofold I think it's both to
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
increase the state share right but also
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
to recognize that it's reducing the
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
burden on property
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers thank you did that answer
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
reasonably close thank you and if I may
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
have a follow up yes you may thank you
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
and the other question I had for you was
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
you testify that you know some of the
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
differentiated AIDS are round numbers
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
and I'm kind of curious given the
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
disparity in the needs of various towns
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
do you believe the state can actually
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
find a number that appropriately
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
reflects the differentiated Aid need for
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
every town you know with making it less
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
round help I
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
mean good
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
question um I don't think that making it
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
less round would necessarily be better
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
just because it would be a less round
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
number my point was
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
that the numbers here were not derived
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
from actual costs they were not derived
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
from linked to the commission of stud
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
School fundings numbers they were a part
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
of a negotiation process and I'm
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
encouraging um I think it would be
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
helpful to look
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
at areas where there's a lot of data
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
such as the court cases the commission
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
of study school funding to actually
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
answer the question that you've been
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
asking asked the the representative
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill what are these costs
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
how do we go about finding how much if
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
if much more at all different categories
 
00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
of students require um and using more
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
datab backed reasons to to figure those
 
00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
out thank you y further questions from
 
00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:14.919 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representative
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative pH thank you um to follow
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
up on that last question do you think
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
that this um one siiz fits-all approach
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
so for example in every single um School
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
District that this that each student we
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
want to fund the it's appropriate to
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
fund the $
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
7,356 for each regular student in all
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
school districts and for the speal same
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
question with a special ed um no same
 
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
question with the free and reduced um
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
$4,000 per each uh free and reduced
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
student I think that's a better example
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
because if you had what if you only had
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
2% free reduced students in the district
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
does it make sense to fund that District
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
at all in terms of free and reduced I'm
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
also thinking about in terms of size
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
smaller districts the per pupil cost is
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
going to be larger than in larger
 
00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:20.519 align:start position:0%
districts so I'm just questioning the
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
this this is not not a perfect bill I
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
guess is would be my answer to that and
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
all the points you're bringing up are
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
good points smaller districts in general
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
tend to have higher per people
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures holding other factors
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
constant some districts have lower
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
amounts of students living in poverty
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
some have higher amounts um and
 
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
increasing base adequacy as the way this
 
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
bill lays out in same as 550 would just
 
00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
you know on its face be an increase to
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
every school district in the state would
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
that be the fairest most Equitable way
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
no it's a more equal way and it's taking
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
into account more again more of the data
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
and the actual what is the cost of an
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
adequate education not just what can we
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
afford and then backfill a definition
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
from there so I think this is a start I
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
it's a good place to build from but I
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of factors some of
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
what you pointed out that would actually
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
make it more Equitable and answer the
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
question what does every student and
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
community and School District in the
 
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
state actually need to succeed and
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
provide that adequate
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
education yep further questions from the
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
committee yes representa
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
my taking my question and for your
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
ongoing yearslong work on this could you
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
just speak briefly about the impact of
 
00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:45.029 align:start position:0%
just speak briefly about the impact of
our

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
current um small percentage of State
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
funding for public
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
schools on the difference in quality of
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
Education among
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
districts yeah so there's you know again
 
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
this comes back to when you you rely so
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
heavily on one tax base in this case the
 
00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
local property tax base everything else
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
stems from that so communities that
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
don't have in general um whether it be
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
you know you're on 93 or more more
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
likely close to a lake ski mountain SE
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
coast and have significant property
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
value to boost up the overall amount of
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
property value that you're able to tax
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
from if you don't have that which is a
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
lot of communities in the State uh 76%
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
of students live in communities with
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
below average equalized value per pup so
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
don't benefit from this system and what
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
you see with that is by having a smaller
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
tax base and having to have higher tax
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
rates puts more strain on the
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
communities right makes passing budget
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
increases a lot harder makes um funding
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
for the schools a much bigger stretch
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
for the residents in the town you see a
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
pretty clear connection to number of AP
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
classes to teacher turnover rates to
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
average teacher salaries to starting
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
teacher salaries to number of sports
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
teams um you see a real clear connection
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
to the things and the opportunities that
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
different school districts are able to
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
provide largely based on their funding
 
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
which again is largely based on the
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
heavy Alliance on local property taxes
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
so there is a Clear Connection there's
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
been a lot of research and and um data
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
that has laid that out and we see that
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
in the opportunities that are available
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
for students the age and quality of the
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
buildings you know do your build are
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
your buildings falling down do they have
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
um you know infestations of one type or
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
another or are they are you able to
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
renew them every few decades and keep
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
them up to dat which all have
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
significant impacts on student learning
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
outcomes thank you further questions
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Burton
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question in 1986 when we were
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
first working on this do you have a
 
00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
question yes please ask the question go
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
ahead is there a direct correlation
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
between student achievement and
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
expenditure per student there was a
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
study published in 1985 that showed that
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the union leader we never saw it
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
again yes there is a connection um you
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
know just like any other expenditures
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
right there's going to be a point at
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
which it has less of an impact and for
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
some students there's going to be a
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
larger impact on expenditures and
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes but there is no question that
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
there is an impact and a relation
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
between increased funding and outcomes
 
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
for students especially for students
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
that come from lower income families or
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
have um other needs that they need
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
resources for to to meet those needs and
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
and have access to the education like
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
their peers um and again there's a you
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
know reducing effect as you go higher up
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
or if you already have a student that is
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
relatively High achieving does not need
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
bunch of additional Services more money
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
for that individual student might not
 
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
make as big of an impact but yes we've
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
seen that in New Hampshire and all over
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
the country um basically that yes money
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
does matter thank you thank you Mr
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
chairman further questions yes represent
 
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
pop thank you Mr chair just a brief
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
follow up to the previous questions you
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
said there is a link between spending
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
per student and educational outcomes I
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
want to understand whether it's a
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
correlation or a causation and if it's a
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
causation whether you have again studies
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
to show that thank
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
you my understanding is that it is a
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
causation um and I can find I'm happy to
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
send the committee there's again it's
 
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
like the framing is does money matter
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
raised the question and there is a
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
report that's put out that says Money
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
Matters and by I believe the education
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
Law Center don't quote me on that I can
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
send it but yes there are studies and
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
again higher impact for some students
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
and some communities coming from more
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
need who had a question on that side
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
represent fellis and then represent cian
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
um um would like to hear your um
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
perspective on um the possibility or the
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of including in our
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
school funding
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
a minimum teacher salary and I the
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
reason I ask that is because we know
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
that there are some school districts
 
00:37:09.069 --> 00:37:09.079 align:start position:0%
which hire new teachers with a salary
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's below 40,000 a year and that
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
those districts seem to be training
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
districts because te they'll get the new
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
teachers and after three years they go
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
to a different district and certainly
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
exper an experienced teacher is more
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
likely to be able to to help kids learn
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I think you're
 
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
referring also to the Newport the
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Newport
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
superintendent last week that made that
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
comment about the kind of training
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
ground um I I think that would be a
 
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
conversation between the the state the
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
legislature and how much control you
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
want to exert over local school
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
districts um that could be if you want
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
increased funding instead of Base
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
minimum salary I think that would be an
 
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
interesting approach um where that would
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
intersect with collective bargaining and
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
local school districts I think it's
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
pretty complicated but I definitely
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
think that teacher salaries are a huge
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
impact um and I think that'd be an
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
interesting thing to
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
explore thank you rep represent
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
cran um I I'm not sure if included in
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
this the what the state funds Public
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
Schools as far as I don't know if it
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
comes under maintenance does anyone in
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
the state inspect school
 
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
buildings uh and is that included in the
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
cost that's provided
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
um especially for buildings that
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
are Health that have health issues that
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
affect the people that work within them
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
we we do have doe here and works with
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
the State Board perhaps rather than
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that's not working for doe to
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
answer that question for you regarding
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
do they go out and inspect these
 
00:38:56.109 --> 00:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
buildings Etc does that want to hold off
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
on that question till we have technical
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
you took the words out of my mouth they
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
would be the best ones to answer that
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh the next person I'd
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
like to invite up is Brian Eaton Brian
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
department and he's here for technical
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
support and perhaps represent CED and
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
you can move your first your question
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
had good morning my name is Brian and
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm with the Department of Education
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
Bureau of school Finance what you have
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
being passed now is a memo um I wasn't
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
aware the fiscal note would make it to
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
today so I want to prepare a memo to
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
summarize the analysis that the
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
department had done um for fiscal impact
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
for this bill um so I can quickly review
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
this it's no more information than what
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
represent uh luno had introduced before
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
just mostly summarizes it uh the top
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
table will show you the changes in each
 
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
of the rates and then the bottom table
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
will show you the changes in each one of
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
the aid and representative luno had
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
described that um about that uh impact
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
to adequate education Aid and then he
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
had hinted and um alluded to that
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
there's also um impacts a charter in EFA
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
which he didn't uh wasn't too sure about
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
um specifically as as familiar with the
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
adequate education Aid so so there will
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
be an impact to Charter a a and EFA a
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
because both of those uh formulas do
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
reference that initial RSA that's being
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh modified um
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
1984a so that is mostly what the bill is
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
and this analysis was done without um
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
any any interaction with any other bills
 
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
I know that was talked about earlier
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
that it was designed to be introduced
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
and um executed in in um in conjunction
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
with another bill we didn't interpret
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
that and we didn't put that into this
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
analysis so this is purely just the
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill and what it would
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
have on uh State funding so I can
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
provide any um explanation or any
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
insight to the fiscal note for this bill
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
or any other questions related to The
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Brian I I know you're
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
from the finance department uh we have
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
Miss White here though also it would I'm
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
trying to F figure out here who is the
 
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
best answer we can have other questions
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
for Brian regarding the fiscal notes
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
here but in terms that question right
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
there would be wiser for would you hand
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
that off to your other cohort here I I I
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe I maybe I not sure if you
 
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
have any insight to
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
that it's related to Building
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
Inspections um neither of us are in that
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
there's a specific Bureau for for
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
inspections the department does conduct
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
inspections but I believe that's outside
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
of what's locally um the jurisdiction
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
and requirements for inspection as well
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
so I can't speak to spefic specifically
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
if if the funding for Education covers
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
that as well I imagine it would either
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
from State funding or local um education
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
tax I'm sure it comes out of that budget
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
if it needs to ref cran is that your
 
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
question you're looking for or response
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah I wanted I just wanted to know
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
if within that cost there is are people
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
inspecting buildings across the state
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
that may be in question of being healthy
 
00:42:26.839 --> 00:42:27.630 align:start position:0%
that may be in question of being healthy
um

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
safe buildings oh so if the funding out
 
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund funds the
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
department to conduct those invest those
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
inspections I don't know off top of my
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
head I'm sorry we can have somebody
 
00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:40.839 align:start position:0%
follow up from our department that's
 
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
specific that well the white division
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
director for learner support um I'm not
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
100% on that but I'm pretty sure that's
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
not coming out of the education trust
 
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
fund that that's coming out of General
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
funds to have um that team which is in
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
the division of analytics that's Caitlyn
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
Davis's the div division director for
 
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.950 align:start position:0%
Davis's the div division director for
that

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that Bureau is
 
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
funded through General funds not
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
education trust funds but I'm not 100%
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the team that goes in and
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
does what was the name of the person uh
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn Davis and I can reach out to her
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure she responds to your
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
question are there there are there
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
questions for for the finance department
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
bill represent fellows um yes I'm just
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can um explain a little
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
bit the um the charter Aid in the EFA
 
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
Aid you know why why those go up and
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
which numbers are you using to push
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
those up sure uh so like I mentioned
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
those the RSA that issues payment for
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
EFA Aid and Charter Aid those reference
 
00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:53.559 align:start position:0%
the rates specified in 19848 which is
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
what this uh bill is modifying so for
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
our estimates we had utilized um to
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
estimate the charter ADM and EFA ADM to
 
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
come up with that estimate of total Aid
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh and so our estimates I believe for
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
Charter we had used
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
the uh we had used Trends between last
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and this fiscal year for so
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
at the time we only have um a couple
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
collections of enrollment for Charter
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
Aid and EFA up to this point we have a
 
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
full year because we pay it out
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
differently than adequacy so we pay out
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
EFA during the year that the students
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
are enrolled uh that's different than
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
District adequacy which is lagged by one
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
year so we only have a couple snapshots
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
of collection so we don't have a full
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
year of data to actually estimate so we
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
use Trends uh between last year
 
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment and this year so far to give
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
our best estimate of what it could
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
be further questions of the
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
department not SE thank you very much
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
for coming today are there any other
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
pink cards for this bill
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
not seeing any I will close the
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
hearing and we have few minutes here
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
before we start the next at 11:00 the
 
00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:07.559 align:start position:0%
next bill is going to be relative to
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
State participation in the Medicaid

Nationwide I first want to share some
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
general information and data points on
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
Hunger here in the state of New
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for many families it has
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
become increasingly difficult to meet
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
basic needs with the rising costs of
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
housing Child Care Transportation and
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
overall expenses a recent survey from
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
September of 2024 found that 39% of New
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children lived in households
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
that reported having insufficient food
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide we've seen increased demands
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
on our soup kitchens food banks and
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
community services and with all of these
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
factors we know more than ever that
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
School meals both breakfast and lunch
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
have become even more essential to our
 
01:01:57.559 --> 01:01:58.750 align:start position:0%
have become even more essential to our
children's

01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
children's
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
well-being the school meal program is
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
critical to so many students when it
 
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
comes to health learning and overhaul
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
Behavior a child who is fed can focus on
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
learning without the distraction and
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
discomfort that hunger brings they have
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
better attendance fewer trips to the
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
school nurse allowing them to stay in
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
their classroom to learn and they have
 
01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:22.039 align:start position:0%
better behavioral and academic outcomes
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
and higher graduation
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
rates when you look at both poverty
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
and childhood hunger as two adverse
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences or Aces we know
 
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
that feeding kids helps them learn
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
succeed and leads them to grow into more
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
successful contributing adults and
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
members of our community the school meal
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
program is an investment in public
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
health our future Workforce and the
 
01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
future of our state I'd like to be clear
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not looking to raise
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
the income eligibility for the program
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
but simply is an attempt to help
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
identify students living in poverty who
 
01:02:58.269 --> 01:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
who aren't being fed at school to
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
qualify for free meals a family needs to
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
be at or below 130% of federal poverty
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
and to qualify for reduced price meals
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
that limit goes up to 185% of federal
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
poverty and this bill does not change
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
that right now parents fill out the form
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
annually to participate or a family can
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
be automatically enrolled if they
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
participate in other assistance program
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
such as snap tanif Head Start or a few
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
other unique circumstances If the child
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
as homeless or foster child families
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
receiving snap and tanif benefits have
 
01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
to submit their income information and
 
01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
be verified and those families can be
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
directly certified into the lunch
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%

information and verification annually to
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
ensure eligib eligibility however
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
because of HIPPA and without USDA

National School meals program and the
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
language of HB 583 is very brief and
 
01:04:09.269 --> 01:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
authorizes the Department of Education
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
to participate in the program I want to
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
dig into the numbers a little bit on why
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
this is needed and how we know that
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
there are low-income kids not in the
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
program when you look at the data the
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
number of children enrolled in Medicaid
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who meet the income
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility is greater than the number
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
of kids who are enrolled in the free and
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
reduced Mals program for this school
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
year there are nearly
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
4,900 public school students enrolled in
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
the meal program and using Medicaid data
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
Services have identified
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
meeting at school at a free or reduced
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
rate but they are
 
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
not think about how easy it would be for
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
these families if when they pulled
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
together their income information to
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
apply for Medicaid at the same time they
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
could apply for the school meal program
 
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
easier for families easier for schools
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
and more kids being
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
fed I'd like to point out that this bill
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
all by itself does not have a high cost
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note outlines what happens
 
01:05:27.789 --> 01:05:27.799 align:start position:0%
when we accurately identify children in
 
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
poverty as this committee well knows the
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
state school funding formula recognizes
 
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
that children living in poverty
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
generally have higher educational needs
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
than other children that's why districts
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
receive increased aid for each child
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
living in poverty and the problem is in
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
how we identify those students who
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
qualify for that increased
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
Aid currently we look to the students
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
who are enrolled in the free and reduced
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
males program which on the surface seems
 
01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
to make makes sense however as I just
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
shared uh we know for a fact that there
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
are more than 10,000 kids in this state
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
who are living in poverty and they are
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
not enrolled in the meals program that
 
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
means those kids aren't benefiting from
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
the meals program and their school
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
districts are not receiving adequate
 
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
compensation to support their needs I
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
believe that the state is already
 
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
obligated to provide additional funding
 
01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
for children in those districts who are
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
living in poverty and should be getting
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
increased aid but not supporting the
 
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
bill due to the unintended consequences
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
is acknowledging and accepting the
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
weaknesses that exist in our current
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
Formula there are so many difference
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
sorry excuse me there are so many
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
benefits to Medicaid direct
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
certification for kids and families it
 
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
reduces childhood hunger improves access
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
to healthy meals increases academic
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
outcomes reduces costs for families and
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
streamlines the process for parents for
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
schools it feeds kids helps them to be
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
better Learners improves the class
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
classroom environment for all students
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
provides more federal funds to districts
 
01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
cutting down on unpaid meal debt it
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
increases efficiency for School
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
Employees who have to process and verify
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
each family and it reduces enrollment
 
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
and verification errors I know that
 
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
there are a number of experts behind me
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
that would like to dig in more into how
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation will be impactful so I
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
will wrap it up but HB 583 is about
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
making sure that every child who
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
qualifies for free and reduced price
 
01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
meals can easily enroll in the program
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification is about
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
good Public Health by making sure kids
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
are fed as well as an example of true
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
government efficiency we have shown the
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
process works with SNAP and tanif and
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
other programs and it only makes sense
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
to use Medicaid enrollment thank you for
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
your thank you very much representative
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
committee Senor thank you very much
 
01:07:52.079 --> 01:07:54.430 align:start position:0%
committee Senor thank you very much
represent

01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
Mahan I have one question really this is
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
actually just a way of automating um uh
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
a way of getting the kids on if they're
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
already certified for Medicaid is that
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
correct it's to make it actually Direct
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you further
 
01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
01:08:11.279 --> 01:08:12.029 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
very

01:08:12.029 --> 01:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.040 --> 01:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand the question
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative uh well the
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
the the statement um was that there's
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
currently uh direct certification if
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
families are enrolled in snap my
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is that snap is
 
01:09:19.149 --> 01:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
underutilized um so that there were
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
probably I would assume many students
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
who are not automatically enrolled in
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
that program
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
that's correct I mean it's it's clear
 
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
that there are children
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
who's qualify to receive those benefits
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
of um available to snap and um I believe
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
that if if Medicaid direct certification
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
was implemented it would also help us to
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
identify those children whose families
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
would also benefit from snap thank you
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
very much further questions not see
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representa thank you
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome uh representa
 
01:09:53.880 --> 01:10:03.229 align:start position:0%

01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
all right shair members of the committee
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Steve Woodcock from Conway New
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um have take them off put them
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
on take them off put them on um i' like
 
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
to present a different perspective on
 
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.910 align:start position:0%
to present a different perspective on
this

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
bill um today the issue on 583 is direct
 
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
certification is very clear it's pretty
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
simple actually I I mean as I look
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
around the membership of this committee
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
I see folks who are apparently well
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
educated probably degreed and they
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
understand the complexity of numbers
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
budgets analytics
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
Matrix percentages Etc most of you
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
probably received a check I was a guess
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh pre-co from the stimulus for $500 or
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
$600 and you accepted it and you spent
 
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
it because you're entitled to
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
it and
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
I bet many here receiving state or
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
federal VA pensions um or company IRAs
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
or 401s because you earn
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
those and I guess that as a worker
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
regardless of your income you paid your
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
taxes federal taxes and now you're
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
receiving perhaps a monthly Social
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
Security uh because you're entitled to
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
it likewise you may have Medicaid A B C
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
D or all the numbers letters who
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
knows but you're entitled to it but just
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
imagine if you were less educated
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps and couldn't understand the
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
system the relief or how to provide food
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
for your children you couldn't
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
paperwork but you're entitled to it just
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
think about it if you couldn't get your
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or your Social
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
Security now here's an option to provide
 
01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
food to the hungriest children of
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
families of poverty and you ladies and
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
gentlemen can make that
 
01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
happen this isn't a
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
handout this isn't an unfunded mandate
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
it isn't an extension of Eligibility of
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
any other law this is helping the
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
poorest Gran sters to a source of which
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
entitled last session this bill failed
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
not because it was justified but rather
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
because folks down the hall said and
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
believe that this would cost too much
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
money what they really meant was the
 
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
decision had didn't have much to do with
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
food or feeding kids but the system the
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
money to which they were entitled as you
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
know it comes from state and federal
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
funds because they're entitled to it but
 
01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.350 align:start position:0%
funds because they're entitled to it but
that

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
changes because it changes the free and
 
01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
reduced allocations to Public Schools
 
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
the public schools that are actually
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
entitled to that money they should have
 
01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
had that money the year before year
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
before year before I needed school
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
systems it wasn't about food without
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
paying our fair
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
share so I ask you today to to do the
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
minimum the minimum provide what's
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
entitled to last year which was 7868
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
youngsters I think was the number as the
 
01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
representative said this morning that
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
number is increased almost by 30% of
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
students that are eligible and are
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
entitled to
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
it the state needs to fulfill their
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide families in the
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
school and funding to the schools that
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
they are entitled to using the entitled
 
01:13:50.669 --> 01:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
funds for something other as a matter no
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
matter how valid the other sources are
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
no matter where we spend out the money
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
and state money in my mind that's
 
01:14:00.629 --> 01:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
misappropriation of funds that we know
 
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
should be going to schools and the
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
children to which they're entitled to it
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you here today to please
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
step up and provide money for this bill
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
and service the children and the schools
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
to the money that they are entitled to
 
01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
thank you m thank you very much
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative and good morning back to
 
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:23.560 align:start position:0%

01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent kokom thank
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman U put the glasses back
 
01:14:29.679 --> 01:14:30.669 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman U put the glasses back
on

01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not sure I understood you
 
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
correctly so I would like some
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
clarification okay on that last point
 
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
that you were making as far as the
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
school being entitled to this money sure
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
um what comes to mind is I'm one of 11
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
children that grew up in a household
 
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
with one income need a question I will
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
get to put we had plenty of food my
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
parents sent me to school with my lunch
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
and you're and therefore the school
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
didn't need to provide me lunch are you
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
saying that the school should still be
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
entitled to that money that I my parents
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
would have qualified for but chose not
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
to well thank thank you for for the
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
question representa what I'm saying um
 
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure R the lad will correct me
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong because he knows the math
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
better than I do um what I'm saying is
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
that the schools receive additional
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
Aid dependent upon the number of
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
youngsters enrolled in the free and
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
reduce lunch program so if we add 10,000
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
or 7,000 youngsters who are already
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
already eligible and whose parents for
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
the most part don't know how to follow
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
the forms if we add them back to where
 
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
they should be because they are entitled
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
to it those school districts receive
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
more funding so if you have 10 more
 
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
youngsters in your school wherever you
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
happen to represent it comes out School
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
District that would be 10 more financial
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
aid free and reduced lunch allocation
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
stiens and rubs and correct the word but
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
additional lifeeast town so about 10,000
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
people 10,000 youngsters today cross the
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
state would provide
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
10,000 whatever the number is I think
 
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
it's 300 some dollars per youngster um
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
to that school system because they're
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for free and reduced lunch
 
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
that's all it is I'm not saying that
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
they should require to feed them I'm
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
saying they should require for the
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
school standpoint the school in the town
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
where you have to come from or city gets
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
extra funding for every youngster on
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
free reduce lunch just like they are
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
English Learners something similar and
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure represent is the correct number
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
but that's that's the essence I'm not
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
going there represent no well he's doing
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
a hell of job though go ahead are there
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
committee did did I I'm ex m m that even
 
01:16:44.669 --> 01:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
more confused than you
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
started no you didn't I just my point is
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
we would have qualified but we chose not
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
to because my parents provided us the
 
01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
food so therefore the school was not
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
entitled to what we chose not to qualify
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
for or apply for okay my if I may well
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
I'd rather not get it going back no
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's no back and for it's just a
 
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
clarification the point was these these
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
folks in this bill today are not those
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
whose parents didn't apply for for the
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
most part these are parents who didn't
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
even have figure out how to use a system
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
and the direct certification is the
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
funnel is the channel for that system to
 
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
help those who can't figure it out thank
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
much the next person is up are there any
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
more questions for represent whitcock

01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning honorable chair and
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is tra
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
Bell and I'm a resident of Portsmouth
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm a parent a former
 
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
School nutrition worker and someone who
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
has experienced hunger both personally
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
and professionally
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
I strongly support Medicaid direct
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
certification for free and reduced price
 
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
School meals while working in schools I
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
saw firsthand how many children go
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
hungry and how many families struggle to
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
navigate the school meal application
 
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
process the stigma of applying for free
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
and reduced meals in the complicated
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
paperwork often prevent families like
 
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
myself from seeking help I too qualified
 
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
but didn't apply because I was too
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
embarrassed Medicaid direct
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
certification would remove the stigma by
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
allowing families to automatically
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
qualify for School meals based on their
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enrollment making the process
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
simpler in ensuring more children get
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
the nutrition they
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
need hunger impacts children in many
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
ways not only physically but emotionally
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
and behaviorally I've witnessed children
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
go from being disengaged and upset to
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
smiling and ready to
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
learn this shows how critical it is to
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
address hunger in schools direct
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
certification can help reduce the number
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
of children coming to school hungry
 
01:19:00.629 --> 01:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
particularly those families struggling
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
with the High Cost of Living it's
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
crucial to simplify the process for
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
providing School meals to Children
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
parents facing hardships prior
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
prioritize medical
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
insurance and applying for other
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
programs like Snap and Medicaid it's
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
already challenging and adding another
 
01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
application for School meals just adds
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
to the burden and often discourages
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
families from
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
applying Medicaid direct certification
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
would reduce this barrier and ensure
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
more children would get the proper
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
nutrition they need in my community my
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
local food pantry has seen a 30%
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
increase in participation over the past
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
year an 80% increase since
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
2021 food and housing costs are on the
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
rise more families are struggling to
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
meet their basic needs and Medicaid
 
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
direct certification would help ensure
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
that children from families with incomes
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
at or below 185% of the federal poverty
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
level receive School meals for example a
 
01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:05.719 align:start position:0%
family of two like myself in 2024 had to
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
earn less than $
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
37,8 14 for a child to qualify for a
 
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
reduced price
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
meal the long-term benefits of Medicaid
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
direct certification are clear Better
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
Health improved academic achievement and
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
a healthier more Equitable future for
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
all students simplifying the school meal
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
process is a vital step towards
 
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
addressing food insecurity I urge you to
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
support HB 583 to help New Hampshire
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
families access the school
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
meals thank you very much are there any
 
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
committee repres yes thank you Mr chair
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mel for testifying I just
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to um understand you testified
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
you saw many children go hungry can you
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
please provide us with any information
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
you have on any children being denied
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
food at school due to their inability to
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
pay or for any other
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
reason in the school district that I
 
01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
worked at we didn't refuse children but
 
01:21:09.629 --> 01:21:09.639 align:start position:0%
often children would feel like that they
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't because they knew that they
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
didn't have money on their account or
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
parents told them or they knew what they
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have known is that they didn't
 
01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
have money on their account
 
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
um so children did often refuse even if
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
I told them not to worry about not to
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
worry about it um they would feel like
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
that they needed to listen to their
 
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
parents thank you thank you further
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
being here and for sharing your
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
challenging personal experience so folks
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
can sort of put a face on the reality of
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
hunger um I'm noting in your testimony
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
and and you stated it that in 2024 a
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
family of two would need to earn less
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
than $
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
37,8 for a child to qualify for a
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
reduced meal and I just did the math if
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
you are working full-time that's
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
$18.17 an hour do you do you have a
 
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
question I'm right at it thank you thank
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
you um could you share or comment
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
on your experience or experience of
 
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
folks you know who are in fact working
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
full-time for wages of 18 or less per
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
hour who therefore would qualify for
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
this even though they're working
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
full-time I live in a large apartment
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
complex with many single parents and I
 
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
know firsthand several um I was one of
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
those people I worked at a school and
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
was feeding the kids and I earned less
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
than that thank you you're welcome thank
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
you very much are there further
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for coming today
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome uh next one is
 
01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:57.880 align:start position:0%

job

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
oops just my old
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
eyes there you I think this is still on
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
yeah um first of all I'd like to thank
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
you for for allowing me to testify today
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid direct certification my name
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
is Adam Osburn and I'm a I'm a principal
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
um locally in the town of Bo Bo Memorial
 
01:23:24.159 --> 01:23:25.350 align:start position:0%
um locally in the town of Bo Bo Memorial
School

01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
um and ironically I'm trying to
 
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
represent like the voice of school
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
leaders in in this process because I
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
think it's an important voice and
 
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
important perspective um in in BO
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
although we only have a 3% free and
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch rate I think there are
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
more kids that would qualify should a
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill like this be in in place um I think
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
it's a good bill I think it's a good
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
example of government efficiency and and
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
logically linking things that that do go
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
together and should go together
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
um so the bill will greatly improve
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
government efficiency and accuracy the
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill will directly link our Med Medicaid
 
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
eligible students with free and free and
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch Services we know that
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
Statewide free and reduced lunch numbers
 
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
um they're they're often a barometer of
 
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
how many kids are in poverty and how
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
many where where services and resources
 
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
should be directed to this bill would
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
then kind of coordinate that number with
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
the number of students on Medicaid to
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
make it a more accurate number and I
 
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
think that's got to be helpful um I
 
01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
think that the free and reduced lunch
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
process can be daunting for some
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
families we' we've heard a lot about
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
that I actually had printed our own free
 
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch application off our
 
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
website before I came in and just having
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
thumb through it it it is daunting it's
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
quite a few pages long there is a lot of
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
text there's a lot of reading um and if
 
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
you're not a person
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
who's that comes naturally to that could
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
be a real barrier this would remove that
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
barrier I think that's important um I
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
think there's also the matter of Pride
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
um which which um representative ccum
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
had talked about and I think that's real
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
I think that I think that's something we
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
need to recognize and I don't know if
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
that's something you build into the
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
legislation or not um maybe it is
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
because that's a I think we should
 
01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
respect that um this bill though will
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
fundamentally ensure that students get
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
what they need Educators Who start down
 
01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
their college pathway learning about
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
teaching and pedagogy and whatnot
 
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
quickly learn about maso's hierarchy of
 
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
needs and until you can meet those basic
 
01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
needs that food that security
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to as
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
effectively get those students to learn
 
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of their lessons it's really
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
hard to focus on math when your stomach
 
01:25:35.709 --> 01:25:35.719 align:start position:0%
growling at 9:30 in the morning um I
 
01:25:37.229 --> 01:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
think there's some practical benefits as
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
well to the state and also to
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities it pass the the bill will
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
improve our accounting of students who
 
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
are actually living in poverty that's a
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
good thing for future resource
 
01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
allocation across probably all of
 
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide Services um I think
 
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
additionally for a lot of towns and it
 
01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
was alluded to earlier meal lunch debt
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
that's a real that's a real
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
consideration for a lot of towns because
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
very rarely do schools just push kids
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
away and say no you cannot eat like for
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
instance at our school we do not do that
 
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
but you end up running a debt at the end
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the year and that's just it's that's
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
got to come from somewhere this if you
 
01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:13.639 align:start position:0%
put more kids on to free and reduce
 
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
lunch will help minimize that probably
 
01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
won't make it go away but it will go a
 
01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
long way toward dressing School Meal
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
lunch debt and then finally um I'm
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
definitely not an expert on full school
 
01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
funding at all but it seems to me that
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
you folks are and you you've recognized
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
that it does cost more per pupil who for
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
students who are in poverty to educate
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
them and and you've set aside additional
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
funds for that and certainly if the
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
number is 10,500 additional students
 
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
that will qualify that's a pretty hefty
 
01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
sum and I I appreciate that but I also
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
think it's the right thing to do because
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
it's about getting the resources to the
 
01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
schools the towns and the municipalities
 
01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:51.639 align:start position:0%
that really need that when you have a
 
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
higher concentration of free introduced
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
lunch students you have a higher need
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
that that goes along with those students
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
so I would encourage you to please
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
support this bill it seems like good
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
governance it seems like a very um
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
logical way to bridge services and I
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate you considering it thank you
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
I support this bill and hope you do too
 
01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Adam are there
 
01:27:12.189 --> 01:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
01:27:12.199 --> 01:27:13.629 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
represent

01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
for coming and taking my
 
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:19.639 align:start position:0%
question does the amount of money that
 
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
your school gets from this program is it
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
related to the number who of of students
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
who are signed up for the program or is
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
it related to the amount of meals they
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
actually come and eat I think it would
 
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
have to do with who is signed up I I
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
think once you're Medicaid ell I should
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
check that make sure I understand your
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
question are you talking about the
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
school funding formula portion the I I'm
 
01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:45.639 align:start position:0%
not sure the exact number maybe $2,300
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
per pupil or are you talking about the
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
number of individual meal reimbursements
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
because that would be they're two
 
01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
different answers like if it's the
 
01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
individual meal
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement if I'm a free introduced
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
lunch student I come through that's a
 
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursable meal if I do a 100
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursable meals in the course of the
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
year it would be reimbursed at that rate
 
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
but if it's the school as I understand
 
01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
it and I don't profess to be an expert
 
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
but there's the secondary piece which is
 
01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
really the trickle down cost that I
 
01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
think you folks are probably going to be
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
considering which is the per pupil
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
additional funding for kids who qualify
 
01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch I I think
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
again not the expert at all and that
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
would be a different answer thank you
 
01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else will answer my
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
question yeah we we we've had that
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
response and the answer uh represent
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
Damon if you can do it in a you know a
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
cliff note manner I'd appreciate it so
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
the two
 
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
parts the differentiated Aid related to
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
a student being enrolled in fnr comes to
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
the school district for that student
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they eat meals or
 
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
not correct the Federal funding for the
 
01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
meals only comes if the child takes the
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
meals right so most children don't eat
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
every single meal that is available to
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
them every single day of the school
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
year they're absent or whatever um so
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's two different pieces um thank you
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
very much are there further questions
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
from the committee yet represent the
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
Fells then represent from papovich thank
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and uh thank you for ask
 
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
answering my question I'm like that that
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
oh I apologize did I jump was it me I
 
01:29:32.669 --> 01:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
did no no no if I jumped I apologies I
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
want to yield to representative fellows
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
my my apologies I you were on Deck
 
01:29:36.679 --> 01:29:38.310 align:start position:0%
my my apologies I you were on Deck
representative

01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you um one of the things
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
that you you said was that the the
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
application is complicated so i' I've
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
seen the application I know what it
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
looks like and I understand they have to
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
provide you know pay STS and that sort
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
of thing I'm
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if putting the application
 
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
online is going to solve that problem
 
01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
and if maybe there are other approaches
 
01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:09.639 align:start position:0%
within the school that could address how
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
to get more people to sign up sure um
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
sure I believe that it's actually a
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
federal requirement of schools that we
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
send this home annually so each August
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
we'll print this probably 12 or 15 page
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
package which is not all application
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot in it uh we send
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
that home with every single student
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
because that's what's kind of required
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
of us early in the school year and I I
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
think that's across the board in the
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
state um we also do have it online as
 
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
well we have it in two places so it's
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're hoping to break down those
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
barriers now now we have another bill
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
coming up that has that involved in it
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
and this bill is about medic Direct in
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
the process that comes from that other
 
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
agency the monies or permission for and
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of issues associated
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
which are policy type issues that we may
 
01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
have to consider but let's do that at an
 
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
another time uh when we have our work
 
01:31:07.149 --> 01:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
session this we need to keep this to
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct
 
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
today rep papovich thank you Mr chair
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
and again I would like to apologize for
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
inadvertently misunderstanding the
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and jumping the gun I apologize
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the confusion and thank you for
 
01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:23.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm curious what
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
does does your school district do at the
 
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
end of the year with the unpaid School
 
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
launch that do you write it off
 
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
obviously by writing it off I mean do
 
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
you pay it from other do you move money
 
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
to pay for it or do you aggressively
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
pursue the parents to collect we're
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
actually kind of a bad example because
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
in BO we are not running a school de
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we we're our our lunch meal that is
 
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
we are not in that boat I know most
 
01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities are but we are
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
not yeah that's a community it's not
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
done have many people in that program so
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
it's I'm good I'm going to give you the
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
information represent Mahan thank you
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm curious about
 
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
something um representative Damon asked
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
does does this mean that when when we've
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
increased by by this automated process
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
that when we've increased the amount of
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
people on free and reduced launches does
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
that also mean that the differentiated
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to go stands to increase as
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
well I believe so yes I think that if if
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
there were another say five students in
 
01:32:25.709 --> 01:32:25.719 align:start position:0%
b just making it up if five students
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
were then Medicaid eligible and that was
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
linked to free and reduce lunch that I
 
01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
believe would trigger that
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
additional is it $2,300 per pupil that
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
would go to the district or thereabouts
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yes the answer is yes represent
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I remembered my
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
question that I forgot when I was
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
explaining before thank you for taking
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
my question um so two parts it's my
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
understanding that most school districts
 
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
and I think this might be in the federal
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
stat statutes on the meals must have a
 
01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.709 align:start position:0%
stat statutes on the meals must have a
designated

01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
designated
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
person who would if a family member was
 
01:33:04.109 --> 01:33:04.119 align:start position:0%
receptive to this facilitate their
 
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
filling up the
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
application is that correct I don't know
 
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
if it's a federal requirement we would
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
help them for for certain yeah challenge
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
getting them in the door yeah and then
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
um separately may I in a question yes
 
01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
um do you see cost savings perhaps more
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
or in districts that have a larger
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
number of f&amp;r students qualifying cost
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
savings because the administrative
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
process would be considerably less with
 
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.470 align:start position:0%
process would be considerably less with
direct

01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
direct
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
certification I would imagine that as a
 
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
yes because it's going to limit the
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
number of hands touching the the forms
 
01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to nmit the amount of time
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the application process thank you I
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%

01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
the significance of child childhood food
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%

Solutions Medicaid direct certification
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
will help address this issue by
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
increasing food access for children
 
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating the need to complete an

application for free and reduced price
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
meals for qualifying children will help
 
01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
prevent this from being a barrier to
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
program enrollment and make it easier
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
for children to have access to the food
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
they need to grow and learn at school we

hope that you will support HB 583 to
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%

that every child has a strong start life

hunger right here in New Hampshire and
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
in June of this past year 2024 we
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
commissioned a national poll that found
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
that voters of all backgrounds are
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
struggling with the cost of living and
 
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
want the government to do more to
 
01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
address these needs um I want to share a
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
few takeaways from that poll uh food and
 
01:39:12.109 --> 01:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
grocery prices were the largest the
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
second largest I apologize problem
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
identified by the people pulled after
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing and that sentiment
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
was shared across party affiliations and
 
01:39:23.589 --> 01:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
across all other demographic markers 87%
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
of the poll participants said that the
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
government should be doing more to help
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
families struggling with food and
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
groceries consistently across those
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
demographic and party lines um we also
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
conducted a state specific survey last
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
month in December here in New Hampshire
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
and that survey found that 71% of New
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters view the cost of food
 
01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
and groceries as a very serious or
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
extremely serious issue voters want to
 
01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
see this legislature take steps to make
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
it easier for kids and families to
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
access food passing this as an
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you to do just that uh
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
we have a number of Advocates across the
 
01:39:59.550 --> 01:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
state as I mentioned um who wanted to be
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
there today um but we're not able to
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
come and so I wanted to share the
 
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts of just one of those Advocates
 
01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
um Ben Buckley who is a new father from
 
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
New Market as well shared the following
 
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
statement children in New Hampshire
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
deserve to attend schools that give them
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
an excellent learning experience the
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to socialize with peers
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
provide access to healthy food and set
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
them up for future success in life those
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
benefits are not available for students
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
students who cannot receive free or
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunches if they
 
01:40:28.750 --> 01:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
qualify these bills and he's referencing
 
01:40:29.950 --> 01:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
this bill as well the ones you'll hear
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
later today these bills would help
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
improve nutrition reduce food insecurity
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
enhance academic performance and remove
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
social stigma around students who need
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
to use this option families that are
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
able to take advantage of these programs
 
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
have incredible benefits HB 583 would
 
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
expedite the process of certifying
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
children on Medicaid for free or reduced
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
price meals removing the administrative
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
burden of completing multiple forms this
 
01:40:54.510 --> 01:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
will not only help government or sorry
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
help students receive their meals more
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
quickly it provides for an easier
 
01:41:00.109 --> 01:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
experience for parents and Guardians
 
01:41:01.709 --> 01:41:01.719 align:start position:0%
meaning they spend less time processing
 
01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
forms and more time playing with and
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
caring for their children overall
 
01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of voter support for any
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
efforts to make it easier for kids to
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%

Hampshire chapter and a mother of three
 
01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chapter and a mother of three
young

01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
young
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
children um I prepared a statement that
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
I sent to all of you um but I also
 
01:42:35.310 --> 01:42:35.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to I just wanted to amend it a
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
little bit based on some of the things
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
that we've heard here today so I think
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room agrees that
 
01:42:44.109 --> 01:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
children deserve access to nutritious
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
food so that they can learn and
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
Thrive um we've heard that there are
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
over 10,000 kids who qualify for
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid which means means their parents
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
have submitted documentation that they
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
have a low
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
income who are not currently enrolled in
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
the reduced and free school lunch
 
01:43:08.109 --> 01:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
program um M label spoke today so one
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
argument that I've heard is you know
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
well the school seems to feed these kids
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe this isn't
 
01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
necessary there is a huge stigma um for
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
families and
 
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
kids around poverty and food in security
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
um I will never forget the first
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
time I had a parent break down in tears
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
in my office she works full-time and
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
I've known her for years her husband
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
works nights they have three kids and
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
she said you know I don't I don't have
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
enough I don't have any food left I
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do
 
01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
so this is a real problem for families
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
and many kids and many families are
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
hesitant to um this and therefore may
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
not go up and get the lunch from the
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
school cafeteria as M Lael said
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I find it troubling also to suggest
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
Alternatives you know um for the reduced
 
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
and free lunch
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
program you know such as maybe if we put
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
it online that will make it easier for
 
01:44:23.550 --> 01:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
families I think that any suggest
 
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
question that perhaps we could miss some
 
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
kids just is inherently troubling to me
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
because I think all of these kids have
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that they do not have or
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
their families have demonstrated that
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
they do not have very much money and
 
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
that should be enough to qualify them
 
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
for the free and reduced school lunch
 
01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.990 align:start position:0%
for the free and reduced school lunch
program

01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of data showing that a
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
healthy breakfast and lunch improve
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
children's physical health improve their
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
behavior if you've ever spent time with
 
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
a hungry child you know that they are
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
not in the form to learn um
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
and having nutritious breakfast and
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
lunch at school also improves long-term
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
Health income outcomes including rates
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
of obesity and chronic disease um please
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
allow all kids the benefit a full belly
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
so that they can focus on learning vote
 
01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 583 thank
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much doctor uh are
 
01:45:34.109 --> 01:45:34.119 align:start position:0%

01:45:34.119 --> 01:45:35.910 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the
committee

01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%

01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh I do not have any
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
do we have somebody from the Department
 
01:45:57.870 --> 01:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
of Education here who can tell us what
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
the income I do have some questions for
 
01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:02.199 align:start position:0%
the Department that
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
are policy oriented like HHS is involved
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
here with Medicaid how is that
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
confidential information released from
 
01:46:14.109 --> 01:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
that department to doe so we know that
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
we have these students we know we have
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
tanif and snap um that was supposed to
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
been resolved the last time we discussed
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
that bill I just like like to know if
 
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a process that's been
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
resolved where a parent can check off
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
the box when they're applying for that
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
with HHS and that how that information
 
01:46:34.109 --> 01:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
then gets
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
to the other
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
department so specifically my question
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
was I was looking for just a chart that
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
tells us what the income limits are for
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
both of the
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
programs we can testify to that okay we
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
got it right here then thank you very
 
01:46:55.629 --> 01:46:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.830 --> 01:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
for okay I asked the public to try to
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
get those all to us because we're trying
 
01:47:00.239 --> 01:47:01.149 align:start position:0%
get those all to us because we're trying
to

01:47:01.149 --> 01:47:01.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
gauge around the schedule that we have
 
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
and these late cards
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes from We're from New Hampshire
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
hunger Solutions I'm Laura milikin I'm
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
the executive director riona deputy
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
director I oversee the Child Nutrition
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire so and and we held
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
our cards because we did not want to say
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
things that other people said so we're
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
just going to fill in a couple of things
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
starting with the eligibility for free
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
meals is at
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
130% of the federal poverty level and
 
01:47:35.709 --> 01:47:35.719 align:start position:0%
the eligibility for reduced meals is at
 
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:43.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
level I think it's worth um pointing out
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
why there are more children on Medicaid
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
than there are on free and reduced meals
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh children are often signed up at their
 
01:47:56.669 --> 01:47:56.679 align:start position:0%
first well child visit if they don't
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
have health insurance um and uh many
 
01:48:04.270 --> 01:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
more families uh feel less stigma around
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid than they do around the free
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
and reduced meal program that doesn't
 
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
mean that their their um families are
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
any less living in need uh it means that
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
that they're willing to give information
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
to get their child health insurance um
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reason they uh can't or
 
01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to sign up for free and
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
reduced meals and um it doesn't mean
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
insecure hello um so another point that
 
01:48:46.589 --> 01:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
I wanted to just state is that we
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
understand that there are a lot of
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
families who do decide to bring uh pack
 
01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
their child's meal some of my work is to
 
01:48:54.189 --> 01:48:54.199 align:start position:0%
work directly with schools to increase
 
01:48:56.430 --> 01:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
that snap direct certification as well
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
as increase participation in school
 
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
meals we do know that the school meal
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
this meals served at school breakfast
 
01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
and lunch um they are nutrition packed
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
for the child so if the child is eating
 
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
those two meals they have the accurate
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
nutrition to learn and grow and they
 
01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.229 align:start position:0%
nutrition to learn and grow and they
also

01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
um can be offered other items in if the
 
01:49:18.910 --> 01:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
district qualifies for dinner as well uh
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
free fresh fruits and vegetables um we
 
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
also o do a lot of work with the
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
business administrators and last year I
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
had 15 schools I worked with directly
 
01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
this year 40 schools so our work at
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
Hunger Solutions is getting larger the
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
number one thing is the direct
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
certification it streamlines the process
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
for administrators as well as the
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
parents it's efficient effective and it
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.229 --> 01:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
overall I'd also like to address um
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
representative papuchi müller's uh
 
01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
question about why we don't data on
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
exactly how many uh kids in New
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are hungry at school or who's
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
being turned away it's just not possible
 
01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:01.719 align:start position:0%
to collect the data because it would
 
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
require children to ask for a meal that
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
they know they can't pay for if families
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
aren't eligible for free and reduced
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
price meals because of the income limits
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
the parents aren't telling their
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
children to ask for meals um our public
 
01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:16.679 align:start position:0%
schools are should not be places where
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
children living in low-income families
 
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
should go hungry or experience feeling
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
of of Shame and stigma and that's why we
 
01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
have to improve how we provide School
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
meals um and Medicaid direct
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
certification would J us
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
that the data we do have shows a
 
01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
significant disparity between children
 
01:50:38.189 --> 01:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
participating in lunch where everyone
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
eats and no one knows who's paying full
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
price for lunch and breakfast which is
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
often very stigmatizing it's considered
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
um you know free breakfast for poor kids
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
um and so um and and also um the
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
comparisons of data that we have during
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
the pandemic when everybody was eating
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
and then what happened after the
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic is also telling people uh not
 
01:51:04.069 --> 01:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
just um low-income families but middle
 
01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
inome families are struggling to make
 
01:51:10.589 --> 01:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
ends meet so um this bill though would
 
01:51:13.229 --> 01:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
not raise eligibility in any way this is
 
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
just uh finding the kids and giving them
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to eat their families can
 
01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
still say no we don't want to eat that
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
there's no part of this that requires
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
children to
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
eat thank you very much are there
 
01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent Damon thank you
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
um this may have been stated at the very
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
beginning of the hearing I was in
 
01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:36.629 align:start position:0%
beginning of the hearing I was in
another

01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
hearing but in case not um can you share
 
01:51:42.189 --> 01:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
with us how many other states are
 
01:51:44.830 --> 01:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
already enrolled in Medicaid direct
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
certification yes there are
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
43 other
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
states um f further question
 
01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:55.390 align:start position:0%
states um f further question
represent

01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
fellows yes can you tell us tell me the
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
income measure that Medicaid uses so you
 
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
you told us free and reduced oh so um so
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
this bill would only certify the
 
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
children on Medicaid who are eligible
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced meals so those are
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
the income limits that are that would be
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
applied so again 100 and and 100 30% for
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
free up to 130% and up to 185% for
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
reduced so Medicaid does cover children
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
at much higher incomes but those
 
01:52:33.629 --> 01:52:33.639 align:start position:0%
children would not be affected by that
 
01:52:33.639 --> 01:52:34.709 align:start position:0%
children would not be affected by that
this

01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:52:37.229 --> 01:52:37.239 align:start position:0%
bill represent
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:52:42.189 --> 01:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
and welcome back I know that we had some
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
good discussions two years ago or one
 
01:52:47.790 --> 01:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
year ago um the question I wanted to
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
clarify was not about an extensive study
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
about the number of children that maybe
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
denied my question is literally if you
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
are aware of one child at one school
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
being denied one meal ever due to their
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
inability to pay I understand the
 
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
complexity of getting complex data and
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
the doe was supposed to gather some
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
information my question about one one1
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
yes there are I do know there I'm not
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
going to list those schools because we
 
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
are working directly with them to help
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
that but there are and specifically
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
older children high school children are
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
denied the food or um given an
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
alternative Meal which is different than
 
01:53:26.669 --> 01:53:26.679 align:start position:0%
everyone else in the school Mr chair I
 
01:53:28.750 --> 01:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
just want to follow up very briefly
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
could you please share that information
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
with the entire committee thank
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for coming
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
oconnell uh chairman lad members of the
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
committee um thank you for having this
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
hearing and allowing us to speak today
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
um so I'm uh speaking in support of this
 
01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
bill um I know that uh a submission has
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
been made under the vice chair of the
 
01:54:07.229 --> 01:54:07.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester Board of school committee and
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
we have submitted a letter in writing
 
01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
and support of the bill um I just have a
 
01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
couple of things to uh say I wasn't here
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
I apologize being late getting here so I
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
know you don't want people to be
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
repetitive so it's hard to avoid that
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
when I don't know everything was said so
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief um you know to me this is
 
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
is is a should be a very simple thing
 
01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
first of all it's a bipartisan or
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan issue we look at the states
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
that have already implemented this they
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
vary from States like New York and
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
California and uh and Pennsylvania
 
01:54:41.790 --> 01:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
states like West Virginia and Kentucky
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
um so and and as we just heard 43 states
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
are doing it I would just like to point
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
out the the there are significant
 
01:54:51.870 --> 01:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
numbers of kids who who end up not
 
01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
getting are not qualifying for free in
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch because the paperwork
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
isn't submitted and that was exasperated
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
because of it changes during covid when
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government allowed um
 
01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
everybody to have free roduced lunch and
 
01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
so people get out of the habit of it uh
 
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
and that's that's exasperated the
 
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
problem but you know from the point of
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
view of good governance and lean govern
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
governing and saving money and doing you
 
01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
know in the city of Manchester we start
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
every year with a number of kid
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
percentage of kids on freedom roduced
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
lunch and it rises throughout the year
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't rise because there are more
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
children coming who are hungry it rises
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
because efforts are made all day long to
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
try to get people to submit paperwork
 
01:55:36.189 --> 01:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
and in the city of Manchester that
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
amounts we're right right now I don't
 
01:55:40.109 --> 01:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
have the exact number but it's just
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
above 50% and that that historically is
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
a little under where it wasi prior to co
 
01:55:48.270 --> 01:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
but let's just take the 50% number that
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
represents about 6,000 children and
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
while they don't all come one at a time
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
some of them might have you know two or
 
01:55:57.470 --> 01:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
three from a family but it's 6,000
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
people pieces of paperwork that have to
 
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
be uh have to be written up there has to
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
be entered there data entry has to be
 
01:56:08.189 --> 01:56:08.199 align:start position:0%
done and you know you do 100 a week you
 
01:56:09.589 --> 01:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
that takes you more than a year maybe
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
you should be doing many more than 100 a
 
01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
week but it's a real issue so it would
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
it would actually make things much more
 
01:56:18.589 --> 01:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
simple administratively and safe costs
 
01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
for the city of Manchester I don't know
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
if they'd be huge costs but there's a
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
cost saving there's work involved in
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
handling paperwork um frankly the the
 
01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
more compelling reason is that we have
 
01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
we have children in the city of
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester and we know in the state of
 
01:56:35.470 --> 01:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who uh are hungry who come
 
01:56:37.629 --> 01:56:37.639 align:start position:0%
to school hungry and that's one of the
 
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
basics need needs that must be met
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
before they're in a position to learn
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
and this is an easy I if you forgive me
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
for putting it like this to commit I
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
think this should be an easy yes because
 
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
of the benefits that acrew from H from
 
01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
from having this bill and and the the
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
lack of negatives so I'd encourage you
 
01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
I'll stop there because I don't want to
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
repeat what other people have said but
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your time today and
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions if
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:57:04.669 --> 01:57:04.679 align:start position:0%
any thank you for coming up are there
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
01:57:09.149 --> 01:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing you thank you very
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
Rihanna that's that's we did did it okay
 
01:57:19.069 --> 01:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
that goes with the firewor on Hunger
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman good morning I'm
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I was absent I was things down
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
where oh good good yeah I was just off
 
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
with the Senate education committee they
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
have a fascinating Bill there um but I
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
and I I know you've heard all about how
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
many children this would affect and how
 
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
important it is and but this being the
 
01:57:46.750 --> 01:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
education committee I just wanted to
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that you had lots of data on
 
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
the educational impacts of being hung R
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
and I would reference you to a really
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
good report by feeding America it's
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
called child food insecurity the
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
economic impact on our nation it's a
 
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
long report but some of the highlights
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
of it they talk about uh math and
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
reading scores between kindergarten and
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
third grade children who have food
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
security gain 84 points and those who
 
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't only gain 73 points so it's a
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
significant uh loss there there are
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
twice children who are food insecure in
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
classif ifed as hungry are twice as
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
likely as those who are not hungry to
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
receive special ed services and twice as
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
likely to repeat a grade so if you're
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
looking if if one of the hesitations is
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
well this is going to increase the
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
number of students who get the free and
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
reduced launch amount under the base
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy plus differentiated Aid it's
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
going to cost the school money if
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
children are accurately fed they will
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
not need as much special ed services
 
01:58:50.669 --> 01:58:50.679 align:start position:0%
they won't need to repe repeat grades
 
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
that would save the state money
 
01:58:55.229 --> 01:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
uh the study also talks about how um
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
school-aged children who are hungry and
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
at risk for Hunger or more likely to
 
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
have problems with hyperactivity
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
absenteeism generally poor behavior and
 
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
academic functioning than they not
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
hungry Fe peers so all of those things
 
01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
are going into perhaps the need for
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
additional services in the school or the
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
need for Paras food insecure children
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
are twice as likely to have been
 
01:59:18.069 --> 01:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
suspended from school that has a
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
tremendous impact on educational
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
outcomes and four times as likely to
 
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
have history of needing mental health
 
01:59:24.990 --> 01:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
counseling and there's a lot more in
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
here where they document how all these
 
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
things will save the state money but I'm
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
just saying if if if your concern is
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
finances feeding the children and you're
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
looking at all these education bills if
 
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
we spend money and this that or the
 
01:59:38.189 --> 01:59:38.199 align:start position:0%
other thing this has got to be one of
 
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
the best cost benefit analysis that you
 
01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
can get hungry children perform well
 
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
imagine coming to the legislature and
 
01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
being here for testimony for six or
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
eight hours today not having had
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
breakfast not having had lunch by the
 
01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon you would not be able to pay
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
attention how can children be expected
 
01:59:56.109 --> 01:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
to pay attention if they aren't
 
01:59:58.270 --> 01:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
adequately fed I guess the last thing is
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
the governor has said that as a state we
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
have to operate like a family and we
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
have to maintain within our family
 
02:00:07.069 --> 02:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
budget if we are now looking at the
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
state government as a family the people
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire as a family the very
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
last thing we're going to do if we're
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
good parents is have Starving Children
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
sitting in school all day so if we
 
02:00:18.910 --> 02:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
really are a family we should feed the
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
children thank you thank you David are
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
there any question question for
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
him yes thank you thank you David um can
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
you tell me the name you read it really
 
02:00:32.669 --> 02:00:32.679 align:start position:0%
quick I got the child food insecurity
 
02:00:34.510 --> 02:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
yes it's called the child food
 
02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
insecurity the economic impact on our
 
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
nation by Dr John Cook he's the Project
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
Director in the organization that's

03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
know I don't know his schedule and what
 
03:06:46.229 --> 03:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
other committees he may be on I know
 
03:06:50.229 --> 03:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:52.990 --> 03:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
and okay I'd like to go ahead and
 
03:06:54.750 --> 03:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
commence with our afternoon hearings
 
03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
here the first bill up is 646 but prior
 
03:07:01.710 --> 03:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
to that just like to make a a note to
 
03:07:03.950 --> 03:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
the folks right here on the committee
 
03:07:07.389 --> 03:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
that today we did vacate the local EFA
 
03:07:08.990 --> 03:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
Bill to
 
03:07:11.110 --> 03:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
education Administration or the
 
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
education policy side of thing so that's
 
03:07:14.670 --> 03:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
been vacated seeing many of the issues
 
03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
in that were policy oriented issues
 
03:07:19.269 --> 03:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with local not necessarily our
 
03:07:25.150 --> 03:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
state money um so so that's HP 748
 
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
yeah well you're
 
03:07:30.469 --> 03:07:30.479 align:start position:0%

03:07:40.190 --> 03:07:40.200 align:start position:0%

restful and rejuvenating lunch to tackle
 
03:07:52.269 --> 03:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
the afternoon and that's exactly what I
 
03:07:54.269 --> 03:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
want for all students here in the
 
03:07:56.990 --> 03:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
granite state um I first want to bring
 
03:07:59.309 --> 03:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
your attention to a letter of testimony
 
03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
that I um have distributed around um
 
03:08:04.030 --> 03:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
from the Reverend Wells from the St
 
03:08:06.750 --> 03:08:06.760 align:start position:0%

03:08:11.950 --> 03:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
bills so I am passing that around now
 
03:08:13.870 --> 03:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
and I hope you can consider it consider
 
03:08:16.469 --> 03:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
it in your deliberations uh again I am
 
03:08:18.790 --> 03:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative lur lki from Hillsboro 11
 
03:08:21.190 --> 03:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
which is nasha's w 8 and I'm pleased to
 
03:08:22.590 --> 03:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
introduce to the committee House Bill
 
03:08:25.550 --> 03:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
646 that would require districts to
 
03:08:27.790 --> 03:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
establish an on online application for
 
03:08:29.349 --> 03:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
participation in the free and reduced
 
03:08:32.429 --> 03:08:32.439 align:start position:0%
meal program earlier today we all heard
 
03:08:34.110 --> 03:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of testimony on the importance of
 
03:08:36.150 --> 03:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
the national school lunch program when
 
03:08:37.469 --> 03:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
discussing the Medicaid direct
 
03:08:39.269 --> 03:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
certification bill so I won't rehash
 
03:08:41.630 --> 03:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
that information but just to establish a
 
03:08:44.190 --> 03:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
baseline both surveys and data point to
 
03:08:46.229 --> 03:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
real food in security here in the state
 
03:08:48.070 --> 03:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
the school meals program is a vital tool
 
03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
to tackling childhood hunger by
 
03:08:51.710 --> 03:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
providing a meal and in many districts
 
03:08:54.150 --> 03:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
two meals to kids living in poverty
 
03:08:55.830 --> 03:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
children benefit from school Meals by
 
03:08:57.590 --> 03:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
being able to focus on learning have
 
03:08:59.429 --> 03:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
better academic outcomes and grow into
 
03:09:01.349 --> 03:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
healthy well adjusted contributing
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
members of our community additionally we
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
know that there are students in poverty
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
over 10,000 of them who are eligible for
 
03:09:10.309 --> 03:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
the program based on their family income
 
03:09:13.309 --> 03:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
but are not yet enrolled this bill House
 
03:09:16.309 --> 03:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
Bill 646 is another attempt to identify
 
03:09:18.469 --> 03:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
these children by offering families an
 
03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
easier more convenient online
 
03:09:23.550 --> 03:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
application for enrolling for schools
 
03:09:25.150 --> 03:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
online applications reduce
 
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens of processing
 
03:09:30.190 --> 03:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
stacks of paper streamlines the process
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
with reduced errors and results in a
 
03:09:35.269 --> 03:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
much timer verification process
 
03:09:38.429 --> 03:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
enrolling the kids more quickly I think
 
03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
we all remember as students ourselves or
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
as parents the paper forms from the meal
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
program that would come home in
 
03:09:47.550 --> 03:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
September in a backpack the form would
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully make it home parents would
 
03:09:50.910 --> 03:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
fill it out put it back in the backpack
 
03:09:52.510 --> 03:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
and if all went well it would make the
 
03:09:54.790 --> 03:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
return trip to the classroom the office
 
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
and eventually make it to the food
 
03:09:58.110 --> 03:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
service department often the forms would
 
03:10:00.030 --> 03:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
be lost in transit or simply not
 
03:10:02.429 --> 03:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
returned at all and in today's world
 
03:10:04.429 --> 03:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
with all kinds of Technology there are
 
03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
still schools who run their program this
 
03:10:10.670 --> 03:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
way the alternative is an application
 
03:10:13.070 --> 03:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
that goes live in mid August before the
 
03:10:15.389 --> 03:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
school year even begins parents receive
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
an email and they can fill out the
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
income information in the privacy of
 
03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
their home without being concerned about
 
03:10:24.269 --> 03:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
who may see that information if it was
 
03:10:26.030 --> 03:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
handwritten on a paper and passed back
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
into the classroom the information is
 
03:10:30.670 --> 03:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
then received promptly and verified by
 
03:10:32.590 --> 03:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
the district and the child can be
 
03:10:36.070 --> 03:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
registered for meals right away the city
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
of nasua has utilized an online
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
application for about 10 years now and
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
speaking with the food service director
 
03:10:43.870 --> 03:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
there I learned that the electronic
 
03:10:47.349 --> 03:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
application can be verified in 24 to 48
 
03:10:50.190 --> 03:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
hours after the parent submit submits it
 
03:10:53.110 --> 03:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
paper forms on the other hand can take
 
03:10:55.750 --> 03:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
up to 10 days if not longer to actually
 
03:10:58.950 --> 03:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
make their way into the district and to
 
03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
get the child certified into the
 
03:11:04.590 --> 03:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
program during this time that child's
 
03:11:06.150 --> 03:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
not in the program they could
 
03:11:07.950 --> 03:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
potentially be eating meals they could
 
03:11:10.950 --> 03:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
be acre meal debt so enrollment in the
 
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
program which is not
 
03:11:16.950 --> 03:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
backdated um time is is a factor that's
 
03:11:19.150 --> 03:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
very important because even if the
 
03:11:21.550 --> 03:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
family is enrolled they don't get
 
03:11:23.590 --> 03:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursements for those other meals
 
03:11:25.389 --> 03:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
that were eaten before they were
 
03:11:28.150 --> 03:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
enrolled so privacy and confidentiality
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
is a big benefit to moving to an
 
03:11:32.710 --> 03:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
electronic format some parents May fear
 
03:11:34.910 --> 03:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
the stigma their child may experience
 
03:11:37.110 --> 03:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
carrying that form in but an online
 
03:11:38.670 --> 03:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
application directly submits the
 
03:11:40.590 --> 03:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
information to the one person who needs
 
03:11:42.830 --> 03:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
it the district employee responsible for
 
03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:43.670 align:start position:0%
it the district employee responsible for
the

03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:11:45.870 --> 03:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
verification for School Employees the
 
03:11:47.710 --> 03:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
work involved with tracking collecting
 
03:11:49.630 --> 03:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
and processing these paper forms is
 
03:11:51.870 --> 03:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
extremely burdensome and the amount of
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
work that staff have to dedicate to the
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
process is significant an online
 
03:11:58.630 --> 03:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
application takes that burden away
 
03:12:00.269 --> 03:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
freeing them up to focus on more
 
03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
important tasks in fact schools that
 
03:12:06.429 --> 03:12:06.439 align:start position:0%
have online applications like NASA
 
03:12:08.590 --> 03:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
report that it makes the entire process
 
03:12:10.750 --> 03:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
easier for both families and the
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
districts and online applications have
 
03:12:16.469 --> 03:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
far fewer errors and mistakes than the
 
03:12:18.750 --> 03:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
inefficient handwritten forms that can
 
03:12:20.990 --> 03:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
often result in rejections that need to
 
03:12:23.550 --> 03:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
then be tracked down and followed up and
 
03:12:26.349 --> 03:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
information um replaced and
 
03:12:28.790 --> 03:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
resubmitted some other benefits to an
 
03:12:31.830 --> 03:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
automated form you can have an online
 
03:12:34.630 --> 03:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
platform with a very userfriendly design
 
03:12:36.670 --> 03:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
and tools that guide the family through
 
03:12:39.349 --> 03:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
the process to fill out the form the
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
form can be provided in multiple
 
03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
languages to reach families that have a
 
03:12:46.030 --> 03:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
language barrier in nashaa their online
 
03:12:48.190 --> 03:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
form has links to Spanish and Portuguese
 
03:12:50.550 --> 03:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
forms but there's also a link to the
 
03:12:52.590 --> 03:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
paper forms to the USDA where there are
 
03:12:55.309 --> 03:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
51 different languages uh with the form
 
03:12:58.510 --> 03:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
available for families an online form is
 
03:13:00.429 --> 03:13:00.439 align:start position:0%
friendlier for those with disabilities
 
03:13:02.349 --> 03:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
who may struggle in completing a paper
 
03:13:05.630 --> 03:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
form and finally parents can apply for
 
03:13:07.389 --> 03:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
the program throughout the year it's not
 
03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
a one-time only application so having
 
03:13:12.030 --> 03:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
that online form available allows
 
03:13:14.070 --> 03:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
families to be able to apply throughout
 
03:13:16.349 --> 03:13:16.359 align:start position:0%
the year if they have a change in their
 
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh job situation or a change in their
 
03:13:21.030 --> 03:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
household and it allows them to easily
 
03:13:25.710 --> 03:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
apply midyear if needed House Bill 646
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
would require that districts offer an
 
03:13:29.349 --> 03:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
online application in addition to the
 
03:13:31.469 --> 03:13:31.479 align:start position:0%
physical paper form which is required by
 
03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
the USDA and that paper form will still
 
03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
be made available for those that need it
 
03:13:38.110 --> 03:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
for example maybe grandparents who are
 
03:13:40.309 --> 03:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
raising grandchildren who are more
 
03:13:42.070 --> 03:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the paper form or
 
03:13:43.790 --> 03:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
families who don't have access to the
 
03:13:47.429 --> 03:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
technology of a computer um or email but
 
03:13:49.349 --> 03:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
either way those paper forms will still
 
03:13:50.590 --> 03:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
still be made
 
03:13:52.990 --> 03:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
available while there is no fiscal note
 
03:13:55.710 --> 03:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
yet I did receive some initial feedback
 
03:13:57.469 --> 03:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
um that it could potentially require a
 
03:13:59.590 --> 03:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
position for assisting districts so
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
there's an appropriation for that as
 
03:14:02.870 --> 03:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
well as funds to assist districts in
 
03:14:05.389 --> 03:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
fulfilling this requirement I'll wrap
 
03:14:07.830 --> 03:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
this up by saying that this bill is also
 
03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
about efficiency for both families and
 
03:14:12.349 --> 03:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
school districts we know that there's a
 
03:14:14.309 --> 03:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
disconnect and a challenge for families
 
03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
to enroll in school meals and providing
 
03:14:19.349 --> 03:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
easy and confidential online option to
 
03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
apply for from home just makes sense
 
03:14:24.269 --> 03:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
shifting to an online application
 
03:14:26.710 --> 03:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
reduces the intense work associated with
 
03:14:28.670 --> 03:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
paper forms and takes the burden off the
 
03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
school staff and gets meals in front of
 
03:14:33.309 --> 03:14:33.319 align:start position:0%
those kids sooner so I thank you for
 
03:14:35.269 --> 03:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
your time Mr chairman and I hope you
 
03:14:37.229 --> 03:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
consider this Bill thank you very much
 
03:14:40.190 --> 03:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the sponsor
 
03:14:42.990 --> 03:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
your refer person McGuire thank you Mr
 
03:14:44.349 --> 03:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question so why is any money
 
03:14:49.710 --> 03:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
here necessary couldn't uh NASA share
 
03:14:52.389 --> 03:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
the software that they developed via the
 
03:14:54.309 --> 03:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
school boards Association or something
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
like that and other people just use it
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
well that's maybe something that someone
 
03:15:01.590 --> 03:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
behind me could address but um we don't
 
03:15:03.630 --> 03:15:03.640 align:start position:0%
have a whole lot of information on which
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
districts actually have the program and
 
03:15:07.990 --> 03:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
a number of districts maybe use a
 
03:15:12.030 --> 03:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
different parent portal so um initially
 
03:15:14.030 --> 03:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
my thought process on the funds that
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
were um associated with this was to not
 
03:15:18.870 --> 03:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
have it be an unfunded mandate on local
 
03:15:22.269 --> 03:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
districts and to help them in providing
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
this format um but I'm not exactly sure
 
03:15:29.070 --> 03:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
if there is a uh one-size fits all that
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
exists right now that can then be plug
 
03:15:33.630 --> 03:15:33.640 align:start position:0%
and play in every
 
03:15:36.910 --> 03:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
District further question represent yes
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you very much Mr chair
 
03:15:40.590 --> 03:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for
 
03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
testifying and taking
 
03:15:45.550 --> 03:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
questions I agree that there are a lot
 
03:15:47.830 --> 03:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
of school districts and can be very
 
03:15:49.950 --> 03:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to uh accommodate the needs of
 
03:15:52.710 --> 03:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
each of one of them individually have
 
03:15:54.389 --> 03:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
you considered when preparing this
 
03:15:57.189 --> 03:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
legislation the possibility of just
 
03:16:00.590 --> 03:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
asking the doe to have a form process
 
03:16:02.510 --> 03:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
the applications and then just pass the
 
03:16:04.389 --> 03:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
data down to the schools it seems to be
 
03:16:07.309 --> 03:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
a slightly less bantine approach than
 
03:16:08.950 --> 03:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
hundreds of individual districts with
 
03:16:10.870 --> 03:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
their own forms thank you for the
 
03:16:13.070 --> 03:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
question um from what I understand the
 
03:16:14.990 --> 03:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is barred from
 
03:16:17.189 --> 03:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
collecting the forms at the state level
 
03:16:18.750 --> 03:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
um and it has to go straight to the
 
03:16:20.550 --> 03:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
districts uh meaning that one
 
03:16:22.870 --> 03:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
application at the state level is not
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
possible but hopefully there'll be
 
03:16:26.229 --> 03:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
someone here that could verify that Mr
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
chair follow up yes thank you for
 
03:16:32.110 --> 03:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
telling me that I was not aware of it
 
03:16:35.189 --> 03:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances though would it
 
03:16:37.950 --> 03:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
be still possible for the district doe
 
03:16:39.590 --> 03:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
to maintain that portal and just have
 
03:16:41.990 --> 03:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
the data go directly to the district I'm
 
03:16:44.670 --> 03:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
just trying to think around you know to
 
03:16:46.550 --> 03:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
see if we consider the possibility of
 
03:16:48.510 --> 03:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
aoid again hundreds of individual
 
03:16:51.269 --> 03:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
districts doing repetitive work that
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
maybe could be done better in one place
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question I
 
03:16:57.910 --> 03:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
think that is a great idea um the
 
03:17:00.469 --> 03:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
possibilities of that I believe are
 
03:17:02.269 --> 03:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
somewhat endless to try to make
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
everything more efficient and I would be
 
03:17:07.229 --> 03:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
interested in exploring it more um no I
 
03:17:09.070 --> 03:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
did not I was not able to dig deeply
 
03:17:10.870 --> 03:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
into that those Solutions but thank you
 
03:17:11.710 --> 03:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:17:15.269 --> 03:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you further
 
03:17:17.110 --> 03:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
questions don't see anything thank you
 
03:17:18.469 --> 03:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
very much thank you so much I appreciate
 
03:17:22.110 --> 03:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
it the next card is
 
03:17:28.189 --> 03:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:32.790 --> 03:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
kuger any more reps that's it no right
 
03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
here good afternoon I'm representative
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
kuger from nashille ward
 
03:17:41.550 --> 03:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
3 I'm speaking to you today in support
 
03:17:43.510 --> 03:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
03:17:46.429 --> 03:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
646 providing an online option for free
 
03:17:49.269 --> 03:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
and red uced lunch is a necessary and
 
03:17:52.750 --> 03:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
valuable bill that addresses food
 
03:17:55.389 --> 03:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
insecurity not only are online forms
 
03:17:58.030 --> 03:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
more efficient for administrative staff
 
03:17:59.790 --> 03:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
they narrow the risk of important
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork being lost or
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
compromised the transporting of free
 
03:18:06.910 --> 03:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch applications by students
 
03:18:09.469 --> 03:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
can result in missed deadlines and
 
03:18:12.630 --> 03:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately with it the Lost opportunity
 
03:18:12.640 --> 03:18:13.710 align:start position:0%
ultimately with it the Lost opportunity
for

03:18:13.710 --> 03:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:18:16.590 --> 03:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
lunch as a former educator I contend
 
03:18:18.790 --> 03:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
that students need adequate food within
 
03:18:22.710 --> 03:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
their school day moreover food security
 
03:18:24.830 --> 03:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
promotes academic
 
03:18:27.870 --> 03:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
success I do know firsthand what it's
 
03:18:31.229 --> 03:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
like to witness kids who are hungry in
 
03:18:34.550 --> 03:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
school I also know that these breakfast
 
03:18:37.389 --> 03:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
and lunches can very well be the only
 
03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
food students receive in their
 
03:18:42.590 --> 03:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
day we can't take the risk that children
 
03:18:45.189 --> 03:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
miss this possibility for food
 
03:18:49.590 --> 03:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
security I ask you to support HB
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
646 and be advocates for the success of
 
03:18:55.910 --> 03:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
our students thank you you're welcome
 
03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
03:19:00.790 --> 03:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
committee now see you thank you very
 
03:19:08.990 --> 03:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:22.349 --> 03:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone um or good
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon sorry um my name is
 
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative Christine cybert um from
 
03:19:31.630 --> 03:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro district 21 which is
 
03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester's Ward one um so I come
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
before you today I I want to thank you
 
03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
all um for being here um as a result of
 
03:19:43.590 --> 03:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
implement I want to talk first about
 
03:19:47.189 --> 03:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester's um experience with this
 
03:19:49.750 --> 03:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
as a result of implementing the online
 
03:19:52.030 --> 03:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
application program in Manchester we can
 
03:19:54.189 --> 03:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
proudly say that more students are able
 
03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
to apply and receive fnr
 
03:20:00.550 --> 03:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
meals or apply for sorry this offers a
 
03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
better option of an entry point for
 
03:20:05.269 --> 03:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
families to apply for the program it
 
03:20:07.229 --> 03:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
results in a more accurate count of
 
03:20:10.510 --> 03:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
students that qualify for fnr in turn
 
03:20:12.150 --> 03:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
this provides additional funding for
 
03:20:13.910 --> 03:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
districts to support some of our most
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
vulnerable students if you see the
 
03:20:18.429 --> 03:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
attack fcal note the cost of this
 
03:20:20.630 --> 03:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
program in Manchester for example
 
03:20:23.269 --> 03:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
through my school apps is between $1,000
 
03:20:26.910 --> 03:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
to $2,000 annually the and the my school
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
apps I think is one of the portals that
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about um with one
 
03:20:34.630 --> 03:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
of with the bill sponsor and I counted I
 
03:20:36.429 --> 03:20:36.439 align:start position:0%
actually went on there to try to do it
 
03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
myself um just to kind of you know start
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
the application process to kind of just
 
03:20:43.510 --> 03:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
see what it was like and there's about
 
03:20:46.030 --> 03:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
20 School option or School District
 
03:20:48.349 --> 03:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
options on there so the there's about 20
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
in that particular using that particular
 
03:20:50.880 --> 03:20:51.910 align:start position:0%
in that particular using that particular
portal

03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
portal
 
03:20:56.269 --> 03:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
program um and so when the my school
 
03:20:58.910 --> 03:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
apps walks one through the application
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
as they are filling it out making the
 
03:21:03.189 --> 03:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
process easier to understand it also
 
03:21:05.150 --> 03:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
provides explanations about the proper
 
03:21:08.229 --> 03:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
paperwork required to fill out the form
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
more importantly this process provides
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to submit an application at
 
03:21:14.550 --> 03:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
any time through the school year if
 
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
there is a sudden loss of income we
 
03:21:19.030 --> 03:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
currently have 20 school districts that
 
03:21:21.030 --> 03:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
provide the online application for this
 
03:21:24.710 --> 03:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
program yet the f&amp;r program is used
 
03:21:27.469 --> 03:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
Statewide while these numbers might vary
 
03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
and change from time to time we cannot
 
03:21:31.870 --> 03:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
forget the interconnectivity of every
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
Community Andor region in New Hampshire
 
03:21:37.110 --> 03:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
if a major employer in an area lays off
 
03:21:39.389 --> 03:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of the workforce natural disaster
 
03:21:42.349 --> 03:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
hits or other sudden and unexpected
 
03:21:45.870 --> 03:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances people there will need
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
will be need for this to be
 
03:21:51.550 --> 03:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
available I don't know about the rest of
 
03:21:53.550 --> 03:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
this body but I do not want to be the
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
last state in the nation that has
 
03:21:56.790 --> 03:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
implemented all of the tools that are
 
03:21:59.429 --> 03:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
available to end childhood hunger we
 
03:22:01.510 --> 03:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
hear over and over again the arguments
 
03:22:03.510 --> 03:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
against supporting legislation based on
 
03:22:06.309 --> 03:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs I cannot help myself
 
03:22:08.269 --> 03:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
but to ask where your religious morals
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
and values are when it comes to our
 
03:22:12.269 --> 03:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
ability to work together and pass
 
03:22:14.469 --> 03:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
legislation that the teachings of Jesus
 
03:22:16.189 --> 03:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
directly compels his followers to
 
03:22:16.199 --> 03:22:17.550 align:start position:0%
directly compels his followers to
support

03:22:17.550 --> 03:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:22:20.030 --> 03:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
please see the following page for the
 
03:22:21.950 --> 03:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
full list of reasons why you should
 
03:22:24.150 --> 03:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
support HB
 
03:22:27.510 --> 03:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
646 any question thank you very much any
 
03:22:29.590 --> 03:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative fellows

thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
03:22:34.870 --> 03:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
testifying yeah do you um when you were
 
03:22:37.469 --> 03:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
using it did you see anything that might
 
03:22:40.950 --> 03:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that I you can read the form in
 
03:22:40.960 --> 03:22:42.150 align:start position:0%
suggest that I you can read the form in
different

03:22:42.150 --> 03:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:22:45.550 --> 03:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
languages there was on the option to
 
03:22:48.229 --> 03:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
pull up like a the like um Laura was
 
03:22:50.910 --> 03:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
mentioning where it it was alongside
 
03:22:52.590 --> 03:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
that area though where you can pull up
 
03:22:54.870 --> 03:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
the USDA form and it had it in just
 
03:22:57.670 --> 03:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
multiple languages so the Manchester one
 
03:22:59.710 --> 03:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
has it in I believe about two
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
languages so thank you further
 
03:23:06.030 --> 03:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
 
03:23:19.269 --> 03:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:19.279 --> 03:23:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
hello

03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
hello
 
03:23:23.710 --> 03:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
again um I'm still Megan brck with save
 
03:23:25.550 --> 03:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
the children Action Network um from New
 
03:23:27.630 --> 03:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
Market New Hampshire I shared earlier
 
03:23:29.870 --> 03:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
today voter views on the government's
 
03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
role in addressing hunger and the
 
03:23:32.870 --> 03:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
intensity with which they view this
 
03:23:34.670 --> 03:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
problem so I will not reiterate those
 
03:23:37.630 --> 03:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
points um I wanted to just address two
 
03:23:41.349 --> 03:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
other items um first being uh the issue
 
03:23:43.030 --> 03:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
of whether students are being turned
 
03:23:45.670 --> 03:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
away for for lunches sort of insinuating
 
03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
the need do we need to enroll more
 
03:23:48.910 --> 03:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
students in the free and reduced um
 
03:23:48.920 --> 03:23:50.910 align:start position:0%
students in the free and reduced um
meals

03:23:50.910 --> 03:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
meals
 
03:23:53.309 --> 03:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
program not all schools are necessarily
 
03:23:55.269 --> 03:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
turning students away who are hungry
 
03:23:57.990 --> 03:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
right whether or not they're enrolled um
 
03:23:59.550 --> 03:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
but in those situations they're eating
 
03:24:02.309 --> 03:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
that cost so by getting all the students
 
03:24:03.990 --> 03:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
who are eligible for the program
 
03:24:05.429 --> 03:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the program these schools
 
03:24:08.830 --> 03:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
are able to um pass over having to make
 
03:24:10.110 --> 03:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
the decision themselves about how to
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
feed those kids and Access Federal
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement I think that's a very
 
03:24:16.590 --> 03:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
important uh point for us to keep in
 
03:24:17.910 --> 03:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
mind that we're accessing federal
 
03:24:19.950 --> 03:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
dollars that um we're entitled to in our
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
state and bringing those to New
 
03:24:21.120 --> 03:24:21.990 align:start position:0%
state and bringing those to New
Hampshire

03:24:21.990 --> 03:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:24:23.990 --> 03:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
citizens um I also want to once again
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
share a statement from one of our
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
Advocates uh we have a lot of Advocates
 
03:24:29.070 --> 03:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
of save the children Action Network one
 
03:24:30.269 --> 03:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
of our Advocates Ben Buckley of New
 
03:24:32.110 --> 03:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
Market shared the following with
 
03:24:35.710 --> 03:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
me HB 646 would allow parents and
 
03:24:37.189 --> 03:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
Guardians with an internet connection to
 
03:24:39.150 --> 03:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
apply online being able to complete
 
03:24:41.309 --> 03:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
necessary forms online is a huge benefit
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
that many Granite State residents are
 
03:24:45.070 --> 03:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
able to enjoy and it should be the same
 
03:24:46.590 --> 03:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
for those needing free or reduced price
 
03:24:49.630 --> 03:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
launches saving time saves money and
 
03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
energy that can be used elsewhere
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
whether it be with their dependents or
 
03:24:54.229 --> 03:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
local businesses in their Community like
 
03:24:55.870 --> 03:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire residents I want our
 
03:24:57.910 --> 03:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
students to find success in school go to
 
03:24:59.429 --> 03:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
college or a trade school and get good
 
03:25:00.910 --> 03:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
jobs so that they may provide for
 
03:25:02.110 --> 03:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
themselves and their families in the
 
03:25:04.269 --> 03:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
future providing free or reduced price
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
lunches to students who need them will
 
03:25:08.110 --> 03:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that they have a bright future I
 
03:25:10.150 --> 03:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass these bills and give
 
03:25:11.710 --> 03:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
the Next Generation the opportunity to
 
03:25:14.469 --> 03:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
realize their potential end quote uh
 
03:25:16.030 --> 03:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
this is a common sense measure to close
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
the gap between those who are eligible
 
03:25:18.870 --> 03:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
for meals and those who are enrolled in
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
the program thank you thank you very
 
03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:27.469 --> 03:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
03:25:31.189 --> 03:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
much uh next person
 
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:42.189 --> 03:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
kuger all
 
03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
right good afternoon everyone thank you
 
03:25:48.349 --> 03:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I'll be quick with you
 
03:25:52.269 --> 03:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
guys but uh I support HB 646 and
 
03:25:54.349 --> 03:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of this bill
 
03:25:56.110 --> 03:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
not all that many years ago I was a high
 
03:25:57.790 --> 03:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
school student who witnessed food
 
03:26:00.309 --> 03:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
insecurity every day I made the decision
 
03:26:02.469 --> 03:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
to help another student who didn't have
 
03:26:05.229 --> 03:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
food or the money to buy in
 
03:26:07.790 --> 03:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
school I bought extra food and lunches
 
03:26:10.349 --> 03:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
to help him out my parents noticed my
 
03:26:12.030 --> 03:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
lunch account was being deleted faster
 
03:26:14.229 --> 03:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
than it should have of course I had to
 
03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
tell them what was what I was doing my
 
03:26:19.269 --> 03:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
mom said exactly what I knew she would
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
why isn't the lunch being
 
03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
provided the truth is the student didn't
 
03:26:25.510 --> 03:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
tell anyone and was likely embarrassed
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
although I never asked is entirely
 
03:26:29.790 --> 03:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
possible that the free lunch form wasn't
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
handed in no high school kid is going to
 
03:26:34.670 --> 03:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
share that of course not I continued to
 
03:26:37.229 --> 03:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
buy the lunches and was happy to do it I
 
03:26:38.870 --> 03:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
can only imagine how a student must have
 
03:26:41.229 --> 03:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
felt though so let's work together to
 
03:26:43.510 --> 03:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
fight food insecurity and be Cent that
 
03:26:45.870 --> 03:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
we've exercised all of our options so
 
03:26:49.469 --> 03:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
please support HB 646 thank you what a
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
nice student appreciate it thank you uh
 
03:26:54.269 --> 03:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
any any questions from the
 
03:26:58.070 --> 03:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee yes R Damon thank you Mr chair
 
03:27:01.110 --> 03:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming and sharing with us
 
03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you could surmise what would
 
03:27:05.150 --> 03:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
have happened if your friend didn't have
 
03:27:07.750 --> 03:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
a friend with the resources to help feed
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
them that that's a good question I think
 
03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
I hope someone would have helped him as
 
03:27:16.349 --> 03:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
well but I he might not have he would
 
03:27:19.150 --> 03:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
just either not eating lunch I guess
 
03:27:21.950 --> 03:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
because I know he was a athlete as well
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
so going hungry well practicing football
 
03:27:27.309 --> 03:27:27.319 align:start position:0%
would not have been a good idea for him
 
03:27:29.630 --> 03:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
um so I guess he's just very fortunate
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
that uh he got to know me so that's a
 
03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
good question I don't think who knows
 
03:27:36.349 --> 03:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
it's a good wh if question no system
 
03:27:38.990 --> 03:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
that you were aware of no yeah there was
 
03:27:42.870 --> 03:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
nothing yeah thanks further
 
03:27:45.269 --> 03:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
questions not any thank you very much
 
03:27:47.790 --> 03:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
awesome than for sharing have a good day
 
03:28:07.189 --> 03:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:10.110 --> 03:28:10.120 align:start position:0%

you um thank you for having me my name
 
03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
is Cynthia tibo and I'm the mckin vento
 
03:28:20.830 --> 03:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
homeless leison for the dairy School
 
03:28:24.070 --> 03:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
District as you may know uh mckin vento
 
03:28:26.910 --> 03:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
assistance Act is a federal program and
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
it was created in 1987 and was named
 
03:28:32.309 --> 03:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
after two Congressional um
 
03:28:33.670 --> 03:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives who are strong
 
03:28:37.349 --> 03:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
supporters Stuart mckin and Bruce fento
 
03:28:39.070 --> 03:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
the aim was to offer assistance to
 
03:28:41.349 --> 03:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
homeless children in the areas of food
 
03:28:43.630 --> 03:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
transportation and access to
 
03:28:47.630 --> 03:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
school um my V mckin vento form Works a
 
03:28:50.349 --> 03:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
little bit differently than the regular
 
03:28:55.070 --> 03:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
um way of getting assistance for food um
 
03:28:56.950 --> 03:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
they come in the parents make an
 
03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
appointment with me I determine through
 
03:29:02.710 --> 03:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
a series of questions if they qualify
 
03:29:06.910 --> 03:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
for mckin vento and then um after they
 
03:29:10.150 --> 03:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
fill out the form I call the um food
 
03:29:12.830 --> 03:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
service director directly and I tell
 
03:29:15.710 --> 03:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
them who is going to be um on her list
 
03:29:19.030 --> 03:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
for Kento for the year so it's like
 
03:29:22.189 --> 03:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
right uh right um that day immediately
 
03:29:24.590 --> 03:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
they'll know who who is to be added onto
 
03:29:26.630 --> 03:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
the list for the next day and those
 
03:29:29.189 --> 03:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
children will get a card just like any
 
03:29:31.070 --> 03:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
other student so that they aren't
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
singled out for um their need for
 
03:29:35.760 --> 03:29:38.189 align:start position:0%
singled out for um their need for
food

03:29:38.189 --> 03:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
food
 
03:29:42.150 --> 03:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
um and the top of it that says relative
 
03:29:44.189 --> 03:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
to so I have a lot of information
 
03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
relative to this is as far as our topic
 
03:29:49.950 --> 03:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
today is concerned the USDA recommends
 
03:29:51.670 --> 03:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
two servings of fruit and three
 
03:29:54.990 --> 03:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
vegetables per day a homeless child may
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
be offered a fruit and a vegetable with
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
their meal while at school and did you
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
know that salsa is considered a
 
03:30:04.269 --> 03:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
vegetable under the federal
 
03:30:06.710 --> 03:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines it is difficult for homeless
 
03:30:08.670 --> 03:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
parents to afford fresh fruits and
 
03:30:11.590 --> 03:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
vegetables nor is there a place usually
 
03:30:15.349 --> 03:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
to prepare food fresh canned or Frozen
 
03:30:17.189 --> 03:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
and Families are living in a f friend's
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
basement in a motel in a shelter or
 
03:30:22.030 --> 03:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
maybe on Grandma's floor so food
 
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
preparation is difficult it might limit
 
03:30:26.910 --> 03:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
a child's intake of the recommended
 
03:30:29.630 --> 03:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
Foods children enjoy raw carrots and
 
03:30:31.429 --> 03:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
celery though celery doesn't contain
 
03:30:31.439 --> 03:30:32.349 align:start position:0%
celery though celery doesn't contain
many

03:30:32.349 --> 03:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:30:34.990 --> 03:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
nutrients another thing is that families
 
03:30:38.870 --> 03:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
and shelters must be out by 6:30 to 7:00
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
a.m. in the morning often with the
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
mother with the baby in her arms and the
 
03:30:45.750 --> 03:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
toddler and toe and most mothers don't
 
03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
have have access to a car or a computer
 
03:30:51.870 --> 03:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
to fill out a form they often come to me
 
03:30:55.269 --> 03:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
to you know fill out the forms and very
 
03:30:57.189 --> 03:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
few of them have strollers to walk the
 
03:30:59.229 --> 03:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
children to the grocery store or to a
 
03:31:01.389 --> 03:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
place where they could access um
 
03:31:03.910 --> 03:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
computer hookups to fill out
 
03:31:06.670 --> 03:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
forms chances of obtaining fresh produce
 
03:31:08.990 --> 03:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
is nil many schools in New Hampshire
 
03:31:11.790 --> 03:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
provide 68 hours of hunger which is a
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
program that packs bags of non-
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
perishable items for the weekend
 
03:31:19.189 --> 03:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
and it usually consists of granola bars
 
03:31:22.550 --> 03:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
and mac and cheese and pasta and similar
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
items and while it is a wonderful
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
program that keeps families afloat
 
03:31:28.630 --> 03:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
through the weekend the children are
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
still not eating their vital nutrients
 
03:31:33.229 --> 03:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
they're still not available to them in
 
03:31:35.070 --> 03:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
the afternoons or on the
 
03:31:37.469 --> 03:31:37.479 align:start position:0%
weekends some schools will put out bowls
 
03:31:39.550 --> 03:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
of fresh fruit in a common area such as
 
03:31:41.349 --> 03:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
the library so children may help
 
03:31:43.990 --> 03:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
themselves during the day apples bananas
 
03:31:46.150 --> 03:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
and oranges are among the favorites
 
03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
however not all schools are able to do
 
03:31:51.189 --> 03:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
this another snag in the 68 hours of
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
hunger in our in our food program
 
03:31:56.590 --> 03:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
overall is that older children usually
 
03:31:59.309 --> 03:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
starting with grades four and up will
 
03:32:02.110 --> 03:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
refuse to take a bag of food because
 
03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
they are immediately identified by their
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
peers as needy and there is a stigma
 
03:32:09.510 --> 03:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
regarding homelessness and the children
 
03:32:11.469 --> 03:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
are embarrassed by taking home the
 
03:32:11.479 --> 03:32:13.269 align:start position:0%
are embarrassed by taking home the
donation

03:32:13.269 --> 03:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
donation
 
03:32:16.630 --> 03:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
bag finally the infants and toddlers are
 
03:32:20.309 --> 03:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
also included under the mckin vento act
 
03:32:22.150 --> 03:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
and under this umbrella donations of
 
03:32:24.630 --> 03:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
formula are rare since it is so
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
expensive you know people don't mind
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
buying a couple of boxes of spaghetti
 
03:32:31.269 --> 03:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
but when they're looking at the cost of
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
a can of formula it's you know a lot
 
03:32:36.790 --> 03:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
different it's very expensive as far as
 
03:32:39.309 --> 03:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
donations go so think about how a
 
03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
homeless mom would feel who can't afford
 
03:32:43.830 --> 03:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
the for formula and she has already
 
03:32:46.510 --> 03:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
watered down what she does have
 
03:32:49.269 --> 03:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
also one more snag is that if the
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
formula or the baby food that is donated
 
03:32:53.790 --> 03:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
it's not often the right kind or it's
 
03:32:56.110 --> 03:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
not appropriate for the child's
 
03:32:59.189 --> 03:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
age and do you have any questions thank
 
03:33:01.630 --> 03:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much any questions
 
03:33:03.710 --> 03:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
represent fellows um yes I'm just
 
03:33:05.630 --> 03:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could share your
 
03:33:08.830 --> 03:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
perspective on how many of the people
 
03:33:11.910 --> 03:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
that you deal with would be capable of
 
03:33:14.670 --> 03:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
filling out the form on their own or do
 
03:33:16.870 --> 03:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
they need help I'm just trying to figure
 
03:33:21.030 --> 03:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
out what percentage of the people I not
 
03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
able to fill out the form thank you I
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
have about um 35 to 40 homeless families
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
during the year and um I would say maybe
 
03:33:37.189 --> 03:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
2third of them are equipped to fill it
 
03:33:39.550 --> 03:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
out and the other ones are not really
 
03:33:43.469 --> 03:33:43.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:47.189 --> 03:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
assistance go ahead
 
03:33:49.150 --> 03:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
if they had it on paper or would they
 
03:33:53.550 --> 03:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
still need assistance probably
 
03:33:55.510 --> 03:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay further
 
03:33:57.670 --> 03:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
questions I got one question for you
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%

Hampshire across the street uh we
 
03:35:11.990 --> 03:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
located in conquer and I oversee the
 
03:35:14.510 --> 03:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
Child Nutrition portion of our work uh
 
03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
currently I have 40 schools that I work
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
with directly um face to face as well I
 
03:35:22.910 --> 03:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
travel across the street ac across the
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
state um to talk at Council meetings I
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
also go to school Wellness committee
 
03:35:29.429 --> 03:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
meetings anyone who needs the
 
03:35:31.349 --> 03:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of uh free and reduced
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
meal applications related to their
 
03:35:34.990 --> 03:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
school meal budget out of all of the
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
schools that I oversee all of them have
 
03:35:40.670 --> 03:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
some sort of alternate feeding process
 
03:35:43.110 --> 03:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
for their children that may be that the
 
03:35:44.830 --> 03:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
teachers and the administrators are
 
03:35:46.469 --> 03:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
keeping a drawer that they purchase
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
items for their students who are hungry
 
03:35:51.830 --> 03:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
that come that come in I also H do some
 
03:35:54.030 --> 03:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
food pantry work and I have an
 
03:35:55.550 --> 03:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
outpouring of schools that are asking
 
03:35:58.229 --> 03:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
for food pantries in their schools with
 
03:36:00.429 --> 03:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
this being said I know there's a lot of
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
solutions to end Hunger in the children
 
03:36:04.710 --> 03:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
this is just one system change that can
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
help at um increase the access for
 
03:36:10.110 --> 03:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
individuals and streamline the process
 
03:36:12.229 --> 03:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
for those administrators who are working
 
03:36:14.710 --> 03:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
with free and reduceed meal applications
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
um it it's way more efficient like Laura
 
03:36:20.550 --> 03:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
tki mentioned we also uh want to state
 
03:36:22.670 --> 03:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
that it's confidential I do have three
 
03:36:24.550 --> 03:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
children at home as well age range from
 
03:36:26.790 --> 03:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
5 to 11 my middle schooler will not
 
03:36:28.469 --> 03:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
bring papers home I don't know where
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
they go um the free reduced mail
 
03:36:33.750 --> 03:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
application has been sent with him I
 
03:36:35.710 --> 03:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
don't receive it it's a crumpled up ball
 
03:36:37.269 --> 03:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere I don't think I'm going to
 
03:36:38.910 --> 03:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
send my personal information in with my
 
03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
middle schooler and it's really hard to
 
03:36:42.349 --> 03:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
send that information with my
 
03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
kindergartener um the stigma around the
 
03:36:47.670 --> 03:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
free reduced mail applic ation is very
 
03:36:51.189 --> 03:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
high that child is unlabeled as free and
 
03:36:53.189 --> 03:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
reduced and I don't want my children to
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:04.630 --> 03:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
voice um it also eliminates those errors
 
03:37:05.870 --> 03:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
like we mentioned with translation
 
03:37:08.269 --> 03:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
services all the browsers now that are
 
03:37:11.309 --> 03:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
used if the online application is there
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to mention that there are
 
03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
some browsers that you can click to
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
translate specifically Google translate
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
anything that is on the um web browser
 
03:37:21.830 --> 03:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
so there are other options for
 
03:37:24.229 --> 03:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
translation services and individuals can
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
do it from their phone uh there was
 
03:37:30.910 --> 03:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh also mentioned in some of our
 
03:37:33.309 --> 03:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
research that majority of individuals do
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
have cell phones so that is something
 
03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
that they can do in the privacy of their
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
home or just outside with our work we
 
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
also like to give signs to schools we
 
03:37:45.070 --> 03:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
have signage to snap and also free and
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
reduce mail applications outside of 10
 
03:37:49.830 --> 03:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
schools right now with this in the
 
03:37:51.990 --> 03:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
pickup and drop off line parents can
 
03:37:54.309 --> 03:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
snap the QR code on the sign and sign up
 
03:37:56.950 --> 03:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
for free and reduce meals and we saw an
 
03:37:59.550 --> 03:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
increase in one of the C Co schools of
 
03:38:01.469 --> 03:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
of the applications which reduced their
 
03:38:04.229 --> 03:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
March 2024 School mail debt from over
 
03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
$1,000 to $343 just by online
 
03:38:10.469 --> 03:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
applications and um not to mention
 
03:38:12.030 --> 03:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
everything else that has said today but
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
I would be open for questions thank you
 
03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions
 
03:38:15.760 --> 03:38:16.870 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions
represent

03:38:16.870 --> 03:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:38:19.150 --> 03:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
03:38:22.110 --> 03:38:22.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for joining us this afternoon um
 
03:38:24.070 --> 03:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
could could you Rihanna could you talk a
 
03:38:27.150 --> 03:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
little bit about um maybe the um the
 
03:38:29.950 --> 03:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
number of families uh that this would
 
03:38:32.910 --> 03:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
help out particularly you know in light
 
03:38:35.550 --> 03:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
of the the the comments you made
 
03:38:37.990 --> 03:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding the or like with respect to
 
03:38:40.630 --> 03:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
the stigma surrounding the um the the
 
03:38:45.269 --> 03:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
paper um application stigma is very big
 
03:38:47.510 --> 03:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
with with the application itself it is
 
03:38:50.189 --> 03:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
put into a usually a folder and sent
 
03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
home um to a parent to try to figure out
 
03:38:55.990 --> 03:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
and if you've seen it is all online if
 
03:38:58.269 --> 03:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
you go to the USDA website or even
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that application
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
is there just it's daunting to look at
 
03:39:06.229 --> 03:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
um it hasn't been updated and we have to
 
03:39:08.349 --> 03:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
stick to those strict guidelines
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
although the online application is
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward there are some schools
 
03:39:15.469 --> 03:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
that do have this within those apps that
 
03:39:17.070 --> 03:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
um another school representative
 
03:39:19.309 --> 03:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned such as link and it is four
 
03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
question boxes and it can approve or
 
03:39:24.269 --> 03:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
deny or say there's an error so that
 
03:39:26.189 --> 03:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
process of stating there's an error
 
03:39:28.150 --> 03:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
happens right then in place rather than
 
03:39:29.910 --> 03:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
having the application sent in with your
 
03:39:32.189 --> 03:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
kindergarten or your middle schooler and
 
03:39:34.349 --> 03:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
then being say being sent back saying
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
you need to redo this so that error is
 
03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
is point in time fixed right with the
 
03:39:39.199 --> 03:39:41.349 align:start position:0%
is point in time fixed right with the
online

to
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
come okay is the department does the
 
03:40:06.150 --> 03:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
department have any information for us
 
03:40:07.830 --> 03:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
on this are there any committee members
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
would like to ask a technical question
 
03:40:12.070 --> 03:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
of the department so we do have one
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:34.110 --> 03:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Kelly Rambo
 
03:40:36.349 --> 03:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
I'm the bureau administrator for the
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
wellness and nutrition um Bureau at the
 
03:40:40.910 --> 03:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
department Melissa white division
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
director for learner support at New
 
03:40:45.389 --> 03:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education
 
03:40:48.510 --> 03:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
so do we have a a question do you have
 
03:40:49.990 --> 03:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
any technical information you like to
 
03:40:51.070 --> 03:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
impart or would you like to just take
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
the questions um I think that we have
 
03:40:55.710 --> 03:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
provided everything um in the fiscal
 
03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
note so we'll be happy to take um any
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
questions okay there were some questions
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh represent
 
03:41:03.750 --> 03:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair thanks
 
03:41:05.710 --> 03:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
for being here here this afternoon and
 
03:41:08.309 --> 03:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
for taking um some technical questions
 
03:41:09.750 --> 03:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
um I want to sort of drill into the
 
03:41:12.389 --> 03:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal note a little bit um it says down
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
here software indeterminable up to a
 
03:41:17.070 --> 03:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
million and then software million
 
03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
dollars for the bayum ending um June
 
03:41:21.870 --> 03:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
30th 2027 just wondering where the
 
03:41:24.429 --> 03:41:24.439 align:start position:0%
million bucks came from given the fact
 
03:41:27.070 --> 03:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
that that the Department of Education
 
03:41:29.189 --> 03:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
created a software platform so that
 
03:41:32.269 --> 03:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
every High School graduating senior can
 
03:41:36.990 --> 03:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
take a a dubiously um you
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
know effective immigration and
 
03:41:43.950 --> 03:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
naturalization test exam uh as a
 
03:41:45.510 --> 03:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement and the
 
03:41:47.030 --> 03:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
department was able to create that
 
03:41:49.189 --> 03:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
software platform for half million
 
03:41:50.750 --> 03:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
dollars is what we heard last week so
 
03:41:52.229 --> 03:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why this one cost so much
 
03:41:54.630 --> 03:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
more sure thank you for the question um
 
03:41:57.070 --> 03:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer that um so the
 
03:41:59.309 --> 03:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is related to at the the
 
03:42:04.990 --> 03:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
local level um so due to the RSA 189 um
 
03:42:08.110 --> 03:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
68 for student privacy we are unable to
 
03:42:10.030 --> 03:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
have that application at a state level
 
03:42:12.630 --> 03:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
so the fiscal note is related to that
 
03:42:14.429 --> 03:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
dollar amount is related to the local
 
03:42:17.670 --> 03:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
level um and currently right now um as
 
03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
testified before there are different um
 
03:42:23.309 --> 03:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
data platforms that each local level has
 
03:42:25.389 --> 03:42:25.399 align:start position:0%
um so we we don't currently have the
 
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
information on what particular data
 
03:42:31.229 --> 03:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
platforms that each local level has um
 
03:42:34.149 --> 03:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
so it's indeterminable for us to to know
 
03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
how much that cost would be some might
 
03:42:39.309 --> 03:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
use um my school meal apps some might
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
use another platform so there's
 
03:42:42.550 --> 03:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
different prices that are associated
 
03:42:44.349 --> 03:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
with that so that's where that number is
 
03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
follow yes so so thanks for that but but
 
03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know I thought that um that that
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
basically went for instance with the
 
03:42:59.429 --> 03:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
with the paper forms that those were
 
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
filled out and collected locally and
 
03:43:04.389 --> 03:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
then information was transmitted to the
 
03:43:07.750 --> 03:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
department so that so that it that some
 
03:43:10.229 --> 03:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
sort of connection with
 
03:43:13.389 --> 03:43:13.399 align:start position:0%
USDA guidelines and so that it was still
 
03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
managed through through the State and so
 
03:43:17.870 --> 03:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why why that couldn't be
 
03:43:20.510 --> 03:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
done here since it appears to be that
 
03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
way with the paper form sure thank you
 
03:43:24.030 --> 03:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
for the question um that's aggregate
 
03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
data that we're getting from the um from
 
03:43:28.510 --> 03:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
the local levels on that that's not
 
03:43:32.110 --> 03:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
family income information um and all of
 
03:43:34.349 --> 03:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
the other items that are listed in um
 
03:43:36.469 --> 03:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
that specific RSA related to student
 
03:43:38.309 --> 03:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
privacy that we cannot collect at the
 
03:43:41.349 --> 03:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
state level okay thank you further
 
03:43:44.110 --> 03:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
questions no any other further questions
 
03:43:46.030 --> 03:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you following
 
03:43:49.429 --> 03:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
up on rep representative luno
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
questioning so is the million dooll uh
 
03:43:56.070 --> 03:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
projected expense for software based on
 
03:43:57.750 --> 03:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
needing to provide software for every
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
single School
 
03:44:02.149 --> 03:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
District thank you for the question um
 
03:44:05.269 --> 03:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
that is what we were going if we we had
 
03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
to give a um some sort of dollar amount
 
03:44:11.229 --> 03:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
and we don't know those districts that
 
03:44:13.189 --> 03:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
currently have that so we that is
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
exactly um what we were um giving a
 
03:44:18.429 --> 03:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
dollar amount on assuming that districts
 
03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
do not currently have it they would need
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
some sort of startup cost um for that um
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
additionally there are um yearly
 
03:44:29.590 --> 03:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs um that schools might
 
03:44:32.910 --> 03:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
need in order to um continue the the
 
03:44:34.990 --> 03:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
application process as well too to make
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
whatever upgrades that that might come
 
03:44:39.269 --> 03:44:39.279 align:start position:0%
from um from a USDA standpoint or even
 
03:44:42.790 --> 03:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
just data um
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:50.790 --> 03:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
is it correct however based on what you
 
03:44:53.309 --> 03:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
just informed us and that we have
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
already heard and know that there are a
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
number of schools perhaps many who do
 
03:45:00.550 --> 03:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
already have online applications so
 
03:45:02.750 --> 03:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
those schools presumably have a software
 
03:45:06.349 --> 03:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
system so this number is the estimate if
 
03:45:08.590 --> 03:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
you were creating an entirely a system
 
03:45:10.510 --> 03:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
for the entire
 
03:45:12.670 --> 03:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
State and therefore this number is more
 
03:45:14.189 --> 03:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
than what it would actually be in
 
03:45:16.149 --> 03:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
practice that is correct we do not have
 
03:45:18.990 --> 03:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
the data on those that currently have an
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
online application at the department
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
level can we ask you to get that data oh
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I what what she want to do is she
 
03:45:32.070 --> 03:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
want to basically ask me and then I will
 
03:45:34.110 --> 03:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
make that request to them sort of
 
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
thought L yeah so that would come after
 
03:45:39.309 --> 03:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
this right here thank you yeah and so do
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up question yes Mr
 
03:45:44.349 --> 03:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
chair would you be able to request that
 
03:45:44.359 --> 03:45:45.429 align:start position:0%
chair would you be able to request that
they

03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:45:48.110 --> 03:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
I heard the of how many districts have
 
03:45:50.429 --> 03:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
online meal applications currently I I
 
03:45:50.439 --> 03:45:51.710 align:start position:0%
online meal applications currently I I
got

03:45:51.710 --> 03:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
got
 
03:45:55.830 --> 03:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
it further questions represent Burton
 
03:45:58.229 --> 03:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
this is a naive question but why do you
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
need a piece of legislation to improve
 
03:46:02.429 --> 03:46:02.439 align:start position:0%
the systems you working at the
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and presumably
 
03:46:06.550 --> 03:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
if this bill doesn't pass you won't be
 
03:46:07.630 --> 03:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
able to do
 
03:46:12.349 --> 03:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
it so the bill is requiring at the local
 
03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
level for them to establish an online
 
03:46:17.550 --> 03:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
application system it's not requiring
 
03:46:20.030 --> 03:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to establish
 
03:46:22.469 --> 03:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
an online application system so each
 
03:46:24.910 --> 03:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
School District having to establish
 
03:46:27.389 --> 03:46:27.399 align:start position:0%
their own online application system
 
03:46:29.630 --> 03:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of products out there
 
03:46:31.189 --> 03:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
we cannot tell you what it's going to
 
03:46:33.269 --> 03:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
cost for each one of them to establish
 
03:46:35.429 --> 03:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
this online application system we were
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
asked to provide what could we
 
03:46:38.670 --> 03:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
guesstimate an amount and we came up
 
03:46:40.349 --> 03:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
with that million doll amount it could
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
be less it could be significantly more
 
03:46:44.469 --> 03:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
we do not know because we are not able
 
03:46:46.110 --> 03:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
to tell you how much it would cost for
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
each one to establish that okay well
 
03:46:48.720 --> 03:46:50.149 align:start position:0%
each one to establish that okay well
thank

03:46:50.149 --> 03:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:46:53.710 --> 03:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
you represent pillows um I'm I'm
 
03:46:56.670 --> 03:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
thinking that that this would be a
 
03:46:59.510 --> 03:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
module a free and reduced module that's
 
03:47:01.870 --> 03:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
inside a a larger system that's
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
collecting enrollment and grades and all
 
03:47:06.990 --> 03:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
of that sort of thing do do you have any
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
inventory in the department about what
 
03:47:13.349 --> 03:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
applic what kind of software is being
 
03:47:16.429 --> 03:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
used to collect the student data that
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
they have to report already so they're
 
03:47:22.469 --> 03:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
all using a different product right now
 
03:47:24.269 --> 03:47:24.279 align:start position:0%
our student information system we have
 
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
switched to an alma system and so there
 
03:47:28.590 --> 03:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
are some school districts that are using
 
03:47:30.510 --> 03:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
the alma system some are using Power
 
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
School some are using Aspen they all
 
03:47:34.110 --> 03:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
have a different product that they're
 
03:47:37.389 --> 03:47:37.399 align:start position:0%
using those student Information Systems
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes they might have a module or a
 
03:47:40.750 --> 03:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
component that's attached to that
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
student information system that allows
 
03:47:44.030 --> 03:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
for the collection of those online
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
applications for free and reduced
 
03:47:48.429 --> 03:47:48.439 align:start position:0%
determinations but some of them do not
 
03:47:50.309 --> 03:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
so it's going to depend on which product
 
03:47:52.429 --> 03:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
that school district is using whether
 
03:47:54.830 --> 03:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
that module is available to to them what
 
03:47:57.790 --> 03:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
the cost could be if not if that
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
particular um system didn't have that
 
03:48:03.189 --> 03:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
ability to add on that then they would
 
03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
be looking at a separate system so
 
03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's why it's it's really variable
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
because there's so many different
 
03:48:11.309 --> 03:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:15.189 --> 03:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
there for and just to clarify but don't
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
have any inventory that tells you which
 
03:48:21.630 --> 03:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
products are being used by which
 
03:48:24.790 --> 03:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
districts no okay thank are there
 
03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
further questions represent
 
03:48:31.469 --> 03:48:31.479 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair so USDA has a
 
03:48:35.070 --> 03:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
model free and reduced price School Meal
 
03:48:38.110 --> 03:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
web online I'm looking
 
03:48:42.309 --> 03:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
at is the department using that in this
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
projection or have you used it at all
 
03:48:48.030 --> 03:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
purposes thank you for the question um
 
03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
so that particular um module online
 
03:48:58.750 --> 03:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
would be called um a road map um let's
 
03:49:00.830 --> 03:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
say on the pieces that you would need if
 
03:49:04.550 --> 03:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
you are an it um vendor to be able to
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
build an online um application so
 
03:49:12.910 --> 03:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
um it it doesn't NE it's not necessarily
 
03:49:14.870 --> 03:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
saying you can take this and utilize
 
03:49:16.910 --> 03:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
this in in all of your locations at no
 
03:49:19.349 --> 03:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
cost it's just the road map on here are
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
the pieces that are required from
 
03:49:24.389 --> 03:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
USDA that need to be in the application
 
03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
and as a vendor you would be using that
 
03:49:29.550 --> 03:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
in order to um to build the application
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
and there are um current um systems that
 
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
do have an application already built in
 
03:49:39.710 --> 03:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
there um for that so that's modeled um
 
03:49:39.720 --> 03:49:40.670 align:start position:0%
there um for that so that's modeled um
after

03:49:40.670 --> 03:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
after
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you further
 
03:49:44.120 --> 03:49:45.349 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you further
questions

03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
much and with that I'm going to close
 
03:50:02.510 --> 03:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
646 and we're going to go directly into
 
03:50:05.640 --> 03:50:10.349 align:start position:0%
646 and we're going to go directly into

so

03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:08.110 --> 03:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
HB 703 this is School Meal
 
03:51:11.950 --> 03:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
day um is put
 
03:51:14.790 --> 03:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
considerable concern about events that
 
03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
occurred in the past
 
03:51:22.269 --> 03:51:22.279 align:start position:0%
year um widely reported in both the
 
03:51:24.070 --> 03:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
gtown school district and the Keane
 
03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
School District but likely not unique to
 
03:51:30.590 --> 03:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
those districts and I don't say that to
 
03:51:34.229 --> 03:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
specifically um call out those districts
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
just that it highlighted a
 
03:51:39.469 --> 03:51:39.479 align:start position:0%
concern um so the intent is to prohibit
 
03:51:41.550 --> 03:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
school districts from denying meals to
 
03:51:44.710 --> 03:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
students who have unpaid meal balances
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
and also although it does not say it at
 
03:51:49.229 --> 03:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
the very beginning to require school
 
03:51:50.870 --> 03:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
districts to
 
03:51:53.950 --> 03:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
accept funding from organizations that
 
03:51:56.229 --> 03:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
come forward and volunteer to help write
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
off school Mill debt and then thirdly
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
when that does not happen or if that
 
03:52:03.670 --> 03:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
does not happen to require the
 
03:52:05.710 --> 03:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to write off the
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
meal debt um
 
03:52:11.030 --> 03:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
so I
 
03:52:13.590 --> 03:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
would start by saying that we should not
 
03:52:15.670 --> 03:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
be penalizing children who through no
 
03:52:18.030 --> 03:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
fault of their own are poor and
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
consequently food
 
03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
insecure for many kids School meals are
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
the bulk of their food intake in fact
 
03:52:27.429 --> 03:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
last year in House Education committee
 
03:52:30.510 --> 03:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
we heard from a school administrator who
 
03:52:32.189 --> 03:52:32.199 align:start position:0%
testified that the hardest part of
 
03:52:34.630 --> 03:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
closing school for snow days was his
 
03:52:36.750 --> 03:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
recognition that many kids would be
 
03:52:39.149 --> 03:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
hungry all day without the presence of
 
03:52:41.070 --> 03:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
School meals in their
 
03:52:44.070 --> 03:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
lives given the lowi income criteria for
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
free reduced meals and as we heard this
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
morning it's 130% of federal poverty
 
03:52:51.070 --> 03:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
level to qualify for free School meals
 
03:52:53.790 --> 03:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
it's 185% of federal poverty level to
 
03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
qualify for reduced price School
 
03:53:01.149 --> 03:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
meals those income levels are very very
 
03:53:04.389 --> 03:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
low compared to the cost of supporting a
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
family today we all know that the price
 
03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
of eggs and everything else in the
 
03:53:13.269 --> 03:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
grocery store is more than it was two
 
03:53:16.510 --> 03:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
years ago 5 years ago 10 years ago those
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
income levels have not been increased I
 
03:53:21.070 --> 03:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
believe it's about 15 years don't quote
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
me exactly on that I meant to look that
 
03:53:24.309 --> 03:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
up but they have not been increased
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
recently they do not correspond to
 
03:53:28.950 --> 03:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
today's cost of living so there are many
 
03:53:31.990 --> 03:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
students who don't qualify for fnr meals
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
even if they were
 
03:53:36.189 --> 03:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
applying but are food insecure their
 
03:53:39.149 --> 03:53:39.159 align:start position:0%
family resources are more
 
03:53:42.750 --> 03:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
limited than needed to comfortably feed
 
03:53:44.830 --> 03:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
the family and cover all the other costs
 
03:53:44.840 --> 03:53:45.830 align:start position:0%
the family and cover all the other costs
of

03:53:45.830 --> 03:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:53:51.710 --> 03:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:57.429 --> 03:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
703 um the first part is not a cost it
 
03:53:59.950 --> 03:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
is about making sure that we don't
 
03:53:59.960 --> 03:54:01.550 align:start position:0%
is about making sure that we don't
stigmatize

03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
stigmatize
 
03:54:04.030 --> 03:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
kids I am the daughter of a school food
 
03:54:06.630 --> 03:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
service director so I grew up with
 
03:54:10.110 --> 03:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
School Meal discussions in my home most
 
03:54:14.710 --> 03:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
of my life um I'm a dietitian I worked
 
03:54:16.750 --> 03:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
all my career at helping people take
 
03:54:19.110 --> 03:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
care of themselves including some work
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
with Hunger agencies and with people who
 
03:54:24.990 --> 03:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
did not have enough
 
03:54:27.870 --> 03:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
resources the idea that we would shame a
 
03:54:30.550 --> 03:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
child by identifying them with a
 
03:54:35.790 --> 03:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
different meal or a wristband or any way
 
03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
kids are smart they know what's going on
 
03:54:40.429 --> 03:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
they see who is being treated
 
03:54:42.269 --> 03:54:42.279 align:start position:0%
differently in the lunch
 
03:54:45.750 --> 03:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
line we need to make it very very clear
 
03:54:48.189 --> 03:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
that that is not acceptable behavior and
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
so that's line five and six in the bill
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
you can't deny a meal to a student you
 
03:54:55.229 --> 03:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
can't serve them an alternative meal
 
03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
because they lack funds or have a meal
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
balance and further online 10 through
 
03:55:01.920 --> 03:55:03.510 align:start position:0%
balance and further online 10 through
13

03:55:03.510 --> 03:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
13
 
03:55:06.670 --> 03:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
um no tokens no stickers no stamps no
 
03:55:09.229 --> 03:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
putting their name on a list at the cash
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
register or the checkout
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
station that a probably very well-
 
03:55:17.910 --> 03:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
intended and kind lunch person employee
 
03:55:19.790 --> 03:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
is scrolling down the list to double
 
03:55:21.990 --> 03:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
check whether Johnny is still on there
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
or not and all the kids around know that
 
03:55:24.840 --> 03:55:28.070 align:start position:0%
or not and all the kids around know that
Johnny's

03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:31.030 --> 03:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
poor I have not seen this next section
 
03:55:32.830 --> 03:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire but this is
 
03:55:35.229 --> 03:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
modeled on North Dakota legislation and
 
03:55:38.309 --> 03:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
other states and there are places where
 
03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
schools have limited student
 
03:55:43.309 --> 03:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
participation in any activities outside
 
03:55:46.110 --> 03:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
of the basic academics if they have an
 
03:55:47.670 --> 03:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
unpaid meal balance like they can't
 
03:55:49.990 --> 03:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
participate in sports or the school play
 
03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
or go on the field trip that's wrong and
 
03:55:55.950 --> 03:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
when we pass 703 that won't
 
03:55:59.710 --> 03:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
happen um and further we cannot require
 
03:56:02.910 --> 03:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
schools to work off their meal
 
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
debt this is not the 1940s or
 
03:56:11.630 --> 03:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
1850s this is today and we don't have
 
03:56:15.189 --> 03:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
child labor or we shouldn't to collect
 
03:56:16.870 --> 03:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
the trash through the school or
 
03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
something similar to work off meal debt
 
03:56:24.149 --> 03:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
um the bill does require that schools
 
03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
develop an Outreach plan to encourage
 
03:56:27.750 --> 03:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
parents or Guardians to apply for the
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
f&amp;r lunch program uh meal program and as
 
03:56:33.269 --> 03:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
other bills today have addressed there
 
03:56:34.710 --> 03:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
are a number of ways we could improve
 
03:56:38.269 --> 03:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
how we do that it also proh prohibits
 
03:56:39.630 --> 03:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
the school district from using a
 
03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
collections agency to collect unpaid
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
School Mill debt and when this bill
 
03:56:46.990 --> 03:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
passes that won't be necessary because
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
we will be providing for
 
03:56:52.469 --> 03:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
it and I mentioned the voluntary
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
donations okay so
 
03:56:55.359 --> 03:56:57.630 align:start position:0%
donations okay so
then

03:56:57.630 --> 03:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:57:01.229 --> 03:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
um I am going to acknowledge that I have
 
03:57:03.670 --> 03:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
not prioritized adequate amount of time
 
03:57:06.389 --> 03:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
on this fiscal note and quite frankly
 
03:57:10.269 --> 03:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
it's troubling to me um I think there
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
will be further discussion and a revised
 
03:57:15.790 --> 03:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
one presented to you because the numbers
 
03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
seem to be based on the total number of
 
03:57:21.950 --> 03:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
meals breakfast and lunch that are not
 
03:57:24.550 --> 03:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
fully paid by the federal government or
 
03:57:26.670 --> 03:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
existing programs well lots of those
 
03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
meals are paid for by families not
 
03:57:31.149 --> 03:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
everyone's food insecure so I don't
 
03:57:33.429 --> 03:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
think the conclusion in here is valid
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
but respect to those who did it and I
 
03:57:37.790 --> 03:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
have not yet talked to them so I
 
03:57:40.389 --> 03:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having that um clear
 
03:57:43.630 --> 03:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
at the outset um with that I will just
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
say that I can't imagine what it is to
 
03:57:46.990 --> 03:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
be a hungry child and actually try to
 
03:57:49.309 --> 03:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
behave and learn so I appreciate your
 
03:57:51.389 --> 03:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
support and hope we can work through
 
03:57:54.590 --> 03:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
this to make it better thank you very
 
03:57:57.070 --> 03:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
much are there questions of the
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative
 
03:58:01.790 --> 03:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:58:04.149 --> 03:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
you for testifying and answering
 
03:58:07.870 --> 03:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
questions could you address the um need
 
03:58:12.349 --> 03:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
for uh one Roman numeral 8h which
 
03:58:14.510 --> 03:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
authorizes the schools to complete the
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
application for free meals for the
 
03:58:20.910 --> 03:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:25.070 --> 03:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
on line 20 thank you for your question
 
03:58:30.110 --> 03:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
26 yes thank you um So currently schools
 
03:58:31.990 --> 03:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
are not permitted to complete the
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
application other than by assisting the
 
03:58:38.510 --> 03:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
parents this would authorize schools if
 
03:58:41.710 --> 03:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
they have the valid information to be
 
03:58:44.590 --> 03:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
able to fill out that form to apply for
 
03:58:44.600 --> 03:58:46.189 align:start position:0%
able to fill out that form to apply for
the

03:58:46.189 --> 03:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
fnr yes thank you and this is the only
 
03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
followup I'll save the rest for work
 
03:58:54.110 --> 03:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
session um how would they get that
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
information if the parent didn't submit
 
03:58:59.229 --> 03:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
an application I'm just trying to
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
understand the scenario in which this
 
03:59:02.830 --> 03:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
will be useful and I'm done this is it
 
03:59:05.550 --> 03:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
last question thank you it was fine um
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's a very good
 
03:59:10.630 --> 03:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
question I don't honestly know I would
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
surmise which is a bit of a dangerous
 
03:59:14.229 --> 03:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
thing to do that they have that
 
03:59:16.189 --> 03:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
information from some other application
 
03:59:19.630 --> 03:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
for some other program and I will find a
 
03:59:22.269 --> 03:59:22.279 align:start position:0%
better answer to that before our work
 
03:59:25.110 --> 03:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
session or a more certain answer are
 
03:59:27.030 --> 03:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
there further questions represent
 
03:59:30.149 --> 03:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
Manan thank you for allowing this
 
03:59:31.389 --> 03:59:31.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
03:59:31.399 --> 03:59:32.590 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
question

03:59:32.590 --> 03:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:59:36.630 --> 03:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
um my my background is is high school
 
03:59:38.510 --> 03:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
imagine the kid who ate his lunch when
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
he came to school in the morning uh and
 
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
he steps in line and goes to get a free
 
03:59:45.469 --> 03:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
lunch um because he knows he's not going
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
to have to pay is there any recourse to
 
03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
somebody like that who's actually just
 
03:59:51.790 --> 03:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
using the
 
03:59:54.870 --> 03:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
system thank you for the
 
03:59:58.030 --> 03:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
question so if I'm understanding the
 
04:00:01.790 --> 04:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
question you're presenting a student who
 
04:00:03.750 --> 04:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
would not qualify for free and reduced
 
04:00:06.830 --> 04:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
bills who's not in the
 
04:00:09.750 --> 04:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
program just tell me that that wouldn't
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
be a given he he could be very well
 
04:00:13.349 --> 04:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
qualified for the for the Freel launch
 
04:00:15.790 --> 04:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
program it's just that if he's qualified
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
for the program why wouldn't he be
 
04:00:18.790 --> 04:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
eligible to get the
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
lunch he's a high school kid and he's
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
hungry so he would he would go in and he
 
04:00:28.389 --> 04:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
would take the lunch and without having
 
04:00:32.510 --> 04:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
paid and and so I mean I just I see this
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
happening I mean I see it happening
 
04:00:36.990 --> 04:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
anyway where where the kid knows the
 
04:00:41.590 --> 04:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
system so I think representative that
 
04:00:47.550 --> 04:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
you are suggesting that a hungry
 
04:00:51.229 --> 04:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
student if this bill were to pass would
 
04:00:52.830 --> 04:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
use this to get more food than they're
 
04:00:54.630 --> 04:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
entitled to is that what you're asking
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
me I I'm wondering if the if the lunch
 
04:00:59.149 --> 04:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
knowing the game would have a recourse
 
04:01:03.750 --> 04:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:06.870 --> 04:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
LGE the point of this bill is for Hungry
 
04:01:09.630 --> 04:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
students to be fed so that they can then
 
04:01:12.910 --> 04:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:15.149 --> 04:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
learning further questions of the
 
04:01:17.309 --> 04:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative fellows
 
04:01:20.750 --> 04:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have any information on
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
which schools maybe do not participate
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the federal program because there
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
will be kids in those situations that
 
04:01:34.990 --> 04:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
are maybe are not getting um fed and and
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
I assume this applies to Charter Schools
 
04:01:38.080 --> 04:01:39.590 align:start position:0%
I assume this applies to Charter Schools
and

04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:42.269 --> 04:01:42.279 align:start position:0%
districts is that correct thank you for
 
04:01:44.910 --> 04:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
the questions um
 
04:01:46.830 --> 04:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
I don't off the top of my head have a
 
04:01:48.469 --> 04:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
list of the schools in New Hampshire
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
that don't participate in the Federal
 
04:01:52.830 --> 04:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
School meals program it's very short the
 
04:01:55.469 --> 04:01:55.479 align:start position:0%
ones that I'm aware of in fact one is a
 
04:01:58.389 --> 04:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
town in my own District Cen which is a
 
04:02:01.630 --> 04:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
very very small K4 school that has less
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
than 30
 
04:02:04.630 --> 04:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
students and they have found it's
 
04:02:06.189 --> 04:02:06.199 align:start position:0%
actually not costeffective for them to
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
participate in the program um I can
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
certainly provide followup on other
 
04:02:15.149 --> 04:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
schools but the vast majority of schools
 
04:02:16.630 --> 04:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire do participate in the
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
f&amp;r school in the federal meals program
 
04:02:22.750 --> 04:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
and your second question
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
was well as we know in our statutes if
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specify Charter Public School
 
04:02:28.990 --> 04:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
then it doesn't cover Charter Public
 
04:02:31.630 --> 04:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
School so in fact this does not apply to
 
04:02:34.710 --> 04:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
them what I just said about the majority
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
of schools participating in the federal
 
04:02:39.630 --> 04:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
meals program was in reference to
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
non-charter Public
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
Schools the charter schools are very and
 
04:02:47.990 --> 04:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think I can accurately speak at
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
least not numerically but most of them I
 
04:02:53.670 --> 04:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.670 --> 04:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
fnr are there further questions from the
 
04:03:00.030 --> 04:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
committee represent luno sure thanks
 
04:03:02.149 --> 04:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and uh and thank you
 
04:03:04.030 --> 04:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and for bringing
 
04:03:07.149 --> 04:03:07.159 align:start position:0%
this forward so in a state that that
 
04:03:10.590 --> 04:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
Allin spends north of $3.6 billion a
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
year on public schools is um is the f
 
04:03:17.149 --> 04:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
note here um even even when you're sort
 
04:03:17.159 --> 04:03:18.229 align:start position:0%
note here um even even when you're sort
of

04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
questioning does it seem like short
 
04:03:22.910 --> 04:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
money compared to what we're currently
 
04:03:25.469 --> 04:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
spending and uh and how improving
 
04:03:25.479 --> 04:03:26.349 align:start position:0%
spending and uh and how improving
student

04:03:26.349 --> 04:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:03:28.590 --> 04:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes you know particularly among
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
students who are hungry um it it just
 
04:03:34.030 --> 04:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
seems like um like like short money
 
04:03:35.710 --> 04:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
given given what we're already putting
 
04:03:38.710 --> 04:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
in thank you for the question and
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
emphatically yes this is a very small
 
04:03:45.309 --> 04:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
investment for the outcomes that it
 
04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
would provide we heard this morning and
 
04:03:50.110 --> 04:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
I think many of us know from other
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
experiences and
 
04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
learning that children who are wellfed
 
04:03:55.750 --> 04:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
have less behavior issues have less
 
04:03:58.510 --> 04:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
special education needs and costs
 
04:04:03.189 --> 04:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
require less Staffing and succeed more
 
04:04:05.710 --> 04:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
so in very casual terms it's a
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
no-brainer in the dollars and cents
 
04:04:08.670 --> 04:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
compared to the rest of what we're
 
04:04:10.189 --> 04:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
investing in
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
education thank you further questions
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
represent guire thank you Mr chairman
 
04:04:18.510 --> 04:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative is it possible
 
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
for parents to tell the school that they
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't want their children to be allowed
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
to have uh meals if they're trying to
 
04:04:30.389 --> 04:04:30.399 align:start position:0%
help their child lose weight for
 
04:04:32.670 --> 04:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
example yes I believe there is a
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism to do that however I will
 
04:04:38.830 --> 04:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
respond to the second part of your
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
question that wasn't actually a question
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's actually very well documented that
 
04:04:45.110 --> 04:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
students who receive School meals have
 
04:04:46.830 --> 04:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
lower incidences of
 
04:04:49.389 --> 04:04:49.399 align:start position:0%
obesity so if that were the reason why a
 
04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
parent wants their child not to have
 
04:04:52.590 --> 04:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
school meals it's not a valid reason not
 
04:04:54.389 --> 04:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
that it's up to me to judge the parents
 
04:04:56.590 --> 04:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
decision but it's not factual um but
 
04:04:58.389 --> 04:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
there would be a way for them to not
 
04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
participate yes no child has to get the
 
04:05:04.590 --> 04:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
meal presently or with this
 
04:05:08.149 --> 04:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
bill this is just addressing no shaming
 
04:05:09.910 --> 04:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
and The Debt Service it's not about
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
requiring children to consume anything
 
04:05:16.349 --> 04:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:19.309 --> 04:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent fellows
 
04:05:21.790 --> 04:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you've thought
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
about how to address the problem that
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
when parents find out that their kids
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
will get a meal even if let's say
 
04:05:33.149 --> 04:05:33.159 align:start position:0%
they're not qualified for free and
 
04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
reduced that if they know that their kid
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
will get a meal anyway even if they
 
04:05:41.510 --> 04:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't pay for it what's to stop them
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
from just not paying anything and the
 
04:05:48.790 --> 04:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
state ends up having to pay the whole
 
04:05:54.510 --> 04:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.149 --> 04:05:57.159 align:start position:0%
student I think that
 
04:06:00.990 --> 04:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
that will happen to some
 
04:06:06.269 --> 04:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
extent we would either accept that as
 
04:06:07.950 --> 04:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
that student is fed and that is a good
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
thing that that student is fed for all
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
the reasons that have been
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
stated or I suppose a district could
 
04:06:19.830 --> 04:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
decide to um communicate with the parent
 
04:06:22.349 --> 04:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
about that
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
um I personally don't have language to
 
04:06:29.429 --> 04:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
put in the bill to say how do you
 
04:06:33.149 --> 04:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
penalize in that way I there there's no
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
program that doesn't have some person
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
who takes advantage of it but mostly
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't um thank you further
 
04:06:42.479 --> 04:06:44.189 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't um thank you further
questions

04:06:44.189 --> 04:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:06:46.510 --> 04:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
you yes oh go
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:06:53.120 --> 04:06:54.910 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you thank you for taking my
question

04:06:54.910 --> 04:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
um just really quickly would this uh
 
04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
Bill sorry would this bill um prohibit
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
04:07:10.510 --> 04:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
from checking in with parents about an
 
04:07:10.520 --> 04:07:12.070 align:start position:0%
from checking in with parents about an
unpaid

04:07:12.070 --> 04:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
unpaid
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
balance no
 
04:07:17.149 --> 04:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you in fact parents should I mean
 
04:07:17.159 --> 04:07:18.229 align:start position:0%
thank you in fact parents should I mean
districts

04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:07:21.149 --> 04:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
should um and most
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
do further
 
04:07:26.910 --> 04:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
04:07:36.109 --> 04:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman um if I
 
04:07:42.790 --> 04:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
may just to answer representative Fell's
 
04:07:44.109 --> 04:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
initial question about the number of
 
04:07:46.349 --> 04:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
schools that didn't have uh programs
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
last year it was 30 um when we did the
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
food meal study it was 30 however six of
 
04:07:53.790 --> 04:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
those child schools actually did get
 
04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
food meals from their public school but
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
has a separate contract um so once again
 
04:08:00.990 --> 04:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for allowing me to
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
speak again uh today this on HP 703 I'm
 
04:08:07.590 --> 04:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
only going to speak to the last part of
 
04:08:09.830 --> 04:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
Representative Damon's Bill and that was
 
04:08:12.189 --> 04:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
the PO was talking about the school meal
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
debt and I just want to take a couple of
 
04:08:18.189 --> 04:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
minutes to touch few points from last
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
session uh while doing the research last
 
04:08:24.030 --> 04:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
year on the at Ellison feed the damn
 
04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
kids food bill we found that over 90
 
04:08:30.149 --> 04:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
school districts last year had end of
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
school meal debt now I suggest that's a
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
small number because right now we know
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
including Charter Schools we have over
 
04:08:39.429 --> 04:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
170 school districts in the
 
04:08:42.030 --> 04:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
state as you know schools go out of the
 
04:08:44.590 --> 04:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
way to make sure that each students have
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
something to eat the reality of which
 
04:08:50.750 --> 04:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
means that each School creates an end of
 
04:08:54.030 --> 04:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
school meal debt that is an additional
 
04:08:56.670 --> 04:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
cost for local taxpayers for every
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
single town in city of New
 
04:09:01.870 --> 04:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire second this morning when you
 
04:09:03.790 --> 04:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
heard testimony on Direct
 
04:09:06.189 --> 04:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
certification I would suggest to you
 
04:09:08.910 --> 04:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
that those students that are entitled
 
04:09:11.429 --> 04:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
but not enrolled in the free and reduced
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
meal program are exactly the same
 
04:09:17.149 --> 04:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
students we see in school in elementary
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
school the middle schools in the back of
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
the room hungry not eating and someone
 
04:09:23.070 --> 04:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
says gez have you eaten today have you
 
04:09:27.149 --> 04:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
eaten today those are the same
 
04:09:30.109 --> 04:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
kids they the same kids from the most
 
04:09:32.990 --> 04:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
needy families in New Hampshire and
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
whose schools are working to feed them
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
in essence this is just another example
 
04:09:41.830 --> 04:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the state passing down more costs to
 
04:09:44.670 --> 04:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
the local taxpayer if only
 
04:09:46.710 --> 04:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
indirectly I'd request that this
 
04:09:48.910 --> 04:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
committee reaffirm their commitment to
 
04:09:50.670 --> 04:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
the needy of families and the hungry
 
04:09:52.429 --> 04:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
students of the State of New Hampshire
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
by passing direct Ser by passing Line
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
application and financial aid to Local
 
04:09:58.870 --> 04:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
School mail
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
debt this is a problem that can be
 
04:10:05.349 --> 04:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
solved and this committee this committee
 
04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
is the doorkeepers to the first step of
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
that solution thank you Mr chair thank

656 um we're on another bill right now
 
04:10:37.469 --> 04:10:37.479 align:start position:0%

hello G this is the last time you'll
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
have to hear from me today I promise um
 
04:10:58.670 --> 04:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to address uh just a
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
couple more points here um the first I
 
04:11:02.429 --> 04:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to share is actually more of a
 
04:11:05.189 --> 04:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
personal reflection um in addition to
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
this being you know my line of work
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
advocating for kids issues here in New
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm also the daughter of an
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
elementary school teacher my mother did
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
her student teaching in Chester and then
 
04:11:14.990 --> 04:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
taught in Marlo New Hampshire for a
 
04:11:16.229 --> 04:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
number of years before moving out of
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
state and if you folks are familiar with
 
04:11:20.750 --> 04:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
that area that's a very rural Title One
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
school and um she is not alone in
 
04:11:26.109 --> 04:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
sharing the story of bringing food to
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
her classroom knowing that kids are
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
be not eating at lunchtime for whatever
 
04:11:33.550 --> 04:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
reason um and are going to be hungry in
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
the afternoon and acting out and if she
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
wants to get through her curriculum she
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
needs to have snacks available in the
 
04:11:42.109 --> 04:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
classroom um teachers cannot afford to
 
04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
be holding up this system on their
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
salaries and we shouldn't be relying on
 
04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
stop Gap measures like this and the
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
kindness of our Educators uh in lie of
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh fully fleshed out systems so that is
 
04:11:57.710 --> 04:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
just one point I wanted to share um the
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
second I wanted to share um is just in
 
04:12:01.870 --> 04:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
in response to um representative
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
Weinstein's question that this bill only
 
04:12:06.349 --> 04:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
addresses the students experience in the
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
lunchroom um it the school can still can
 
04:12:12.750 --> 04:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to collect from parents um my
 
04:12:14.269 --> 04:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the schools can't
 
04:12:17.429 --> 04:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
even take parents to court um so this is
 
04:12:19.109 --> 04:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
not about you know allowing parents to
 
04:12:20.510 --> 04:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
shk personal
 
04:12:22.590 --> 04:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility um and and not have to
 
04:12:24.109 --> 04:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
pay for these meals it's really just
 
04:12:28.750 --> 04:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
about students not bearing the uh burden
 
04:12:30.269 --> 04:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
of that in the meantime and them being
 
04:12:31.750 --> 04:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
fed kind of regardless of what's going
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
on between the school and the parents so
 
04:12:34.750 --> 04:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clear those two things
 
04:12:35.950 --> 04:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
up and then I once again have a
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
statement from our passionate Advocate
 
04:12:40.990 --> 04:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
Ben Buckley of New Market HB 703 is a
 
04:12:42.750 --> 04:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
critical component of removing social
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
stigma from those in need of those
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
programs while providing Public Schools
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
the funds they need to give these
 
04:12:50.269 --> 04:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
students what they need it's been shown
 
04:12:51.670 --> 04:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
that students who are consistently made
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
fun of or belied are at increased risk
 
04:12:55.149 --> 04:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
for poor academic achievement according
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
to current research with this bill those
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
students uh taking advantage of this
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
program will not experience those issues
 
04:13:03.950 --> 04:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
end quote so we all know that kids can't
 
04:13:05.790 --> 04:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
learn if they're hungry we're all
 
04:13:07.149 --> 04:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
passionate about making sure the Next
 
04:13:09.070 --> 04:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
Generation has an education um I don't
 
04:13:10.830 --> 04:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
think that's being debated here um so
 
04:13:12.590 --> 04:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
the bill before you is a step to make
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
sure that you can take to make sure the
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
next generation is healthy and educated
 
04:13:17.950 --> 04:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
um and once again I'll just reiterate
 
04:13:19.070 --> 04:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
that voters want to see this
 
04:13:21.550 --> 04:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
Administration take uh definitive action
 
04:13:24.030 --> 04:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
to get kids fed thank you thank you very
 
04:13:26.349 --> 04:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
much questions from the
 
04:13:28.389 --> 04:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:37.469 --> 04:13:37.479 align:start position:0%
core thank you Mr chairman again I hope
 
04:13:38.670 --> 04:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
this is the last time you hear from me
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
today um thank you for the clarification
 
04:13:43.990 --> 04:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
Megan I did want to state that this bill
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
is specifically about how kids are
 
04:13:48.109 --> 04:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
treated in the lunchroom we do know that
 
04:13:49.790 --> 04:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of the schools across the state of
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are adapting the social
 
04:13:53.469 --> 04:13:53.479 align:start position:0%
emotional well-being of the child into
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
their curriculums so this is something
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
that also goes on behalf of that the
 
04:13:59.469 --> 04:13:59.479 align:start position:0%
child should not know the financial
 
04:14:01.870 --> 04:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
situation of their parents if it is the
 
04:14:03.710 --> 04:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
caregiver if it is the parent or
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
guardian or if they even even are in
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
foster care there um isn't a lot of
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
schools that I directly work with but
 
04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
there has been schools that have turned
 
04:14:13.590 --> 04:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
away children who do have negative meal
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
debt or also um serve them an alter
 
04:14:19.550 --> 04:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
alternative Meal which is not what the
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
other children are receiving so this
 
04:14:23.389 --> 04:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
bill specifically is to not shaming the
 
04:14:25.950 --> 04:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
shame the CH to not shame that child who
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
is going through that meal line and um
 
04:14:31.149 --> 04:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
and to protect the child within a safe
 
04:14:31.159 --> 04:14:32.189 align:start position:0%
and to protect the child within a safe
School

04:14:32.189 --> 04:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
School
 
04:14:34.870 --> 04:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
environment uh how is school meal debt
 
04:14:37.149 --> 04:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
created there's a lot of ways in the
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
beginning of the school school year you
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
can have that free and reduced mail
 
04:14:44.030 --> 04:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
application filled out if you do fill it
 
04:14:46.590 --> 04:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
out after a couple weeks or months it is
 
04:14:49.109 --> 04:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
not retroactive so that School Meal debt
 
04:14:51.149 --> 04:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
stays into the child's account and
 
04:14:53.950 --> 04:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
therefore it is incurred um I do want to
 
04:14:55.550 --> 04:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
State there are other ways to be
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
directly certified and I hope there will
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
be other ways such as Medicaid direct
 
04:15:01.790 --> 04:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
certification into that but then again
 
04:15:03.750 --> 04:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
there will still be School Meal debt so
 
04:15:06.109 --> 04:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
the school meal debt it's not new every
 
04:15:07.710 --> 04:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
school that I work with the 40 schools
 
04:15:10.149 --> 04:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
they do have school meal debt um it is
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
higher now and it is because there
 
04:15:15.550 --> 04:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
aren't those systems in place to help
 
04:15:17.910 --> 04:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
the parents caregivers families be
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
directly certified into free and reduced
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
School meals and I do want to remind you
 
04:15:24.309 --> 04:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
that USDA has come a long way with the
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
regulations um School meals are healthy
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
they are yummy the the cine Minis that
 
04:15:32.189 --> 04:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
are at the school they're actually 50%
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
or more whole grain you cannot buy those
 
04:15:36.109 --> 04:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
in the school in the stores the Froot
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
Loops that are that are served at school
 
04:15:39.870 --> 04:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
there's regulations they have extra
 
04:15:41.830 --> 04:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
vitamins minerals and whole grains so I
 
04:15:43.510 --> 04:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
do want to clarify the those School
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
meals they're delicious they're
 
04:15:46.990 --> 04:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
different than what you ate at school I
 
04:15:50.030 --> 04:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
promise you that I do want to also state
 
04:15:53.349 --> 04:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
that we have over 255 online testimonies
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
I do hope you see uh the online
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
testimonies for this bill just to reduce
 
04:15:59.429 --> 04:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
the shaming of the child within that
 
04:16:02.550 --> 04:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
School Meal line um and this is just to
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
protect the child's well well-being we
 
04:16:08.109 --> 04:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
do see that if a child is turned away
 
04:16:10.309 --> 04:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
once they are not going to go back into
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
that line even if there is money in
 
04:16:14.590 --> 04:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
their account that shame runs deep the
 
04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
embarrassment with their peers not only
 
04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
peers teachers know the financial
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
situations of the family I do not think
 
04:16:23.950 --> 04:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
that is right and I urge you ought to
 
04:16:27.910 --> 04:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
pass on HP 703 thank you very much are
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
there questions from the
 
04:16:32.429 --> 04:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
committee no
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
04:16:58.229 --> 04:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.870 --> 04:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon once again my name is
 
04:17:03.790 --> 04:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
Cynthia tibo I'm the mckin vento Le on
 
04:17:06.030 --> 04:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
for the dairy School
 
04:17:09.030 --> 04:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
District um there's nothing worse for a
 
04:17:10.590 --> 04:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
child than to be shamed in front of
 
04:17:10.600 --> 04:17:11.510 align:start position:0%
child than to be shamed in front of
one's

04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
one's
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
peers um and before I say anything else
 
04:17:16.710 --> 04:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
I just want you to know that um our
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
nutrition staff and front offices are
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful and compassionate people but
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
when the rules need to be followed it
 
04:17:25.870 --> 04:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
can seem very harsh to a parent and they
 
04:17:28.990 --> 04:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
do get they do get upset recently I had
 
04:17:31.229 --> 04:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
a mom tell me in tears that she that
 
04:17:33.309 --> 04:17:33.319 align:start position:0%
since she had a balance on her meal plan
 
04:17:36.030 --> 04:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
her child a third grader was offered
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
milk and a piece of cheese on a
 
04:17:40.630 --> 04:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
hamburger roll this child happened to be
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
lactose intolerant but she was too sh sh
 
04:17:45.990 --> 04:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
afraid to tell a busy adult about this
 
04:17:48.269 --> 04:17:48.279 align:start position:0%
problem she told her mother that she
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
would rather forgo the milk and cheese
 
04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
sandwich than be seen with it by her
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
friends the other children would
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that she is poor and might
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
make comments or assumptions this was
 
04:18:00.790 --> 04:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking for this mother to hear
 
04:18:02.950 --> 04:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
from her daughter and she broke down and
 
04:18:05.950 --> 04:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
cried also this is not enough nutrition
 
04:18:07.990 --> 04:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
for a third grader especially if the
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
meal is skipped how can a child
 
04:18:11.910 --> 04:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
concentrate when they aren't full and
 
04:18:14.510 --> 04:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
happy this child went the entire day
 
04:18:16.870 --> 04:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
without food
 
04:18:19.710 --> 04:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
luckily they qualified for mckin vento
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
and the very next day she was able to
 
04:18:24.830 --> 04:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
have regular lunch with all of her
 
04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
friends it would be helpful if any child
 
04:18:29.630 --> 04:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
could receive the same meal as his or
 
04:18:33.149 --> 04:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
her peers even if the account is overdue
 
04:18:37.149 --> 04:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
but how House Bill 703 would be a good
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
start we must also win the practice of
 
04:18:42.109 --> 04:18:42.119 align:start position:0%
telling the child to tell his or her
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
parents to pay the bill I haven't heard
 
04:18:48.670 --> 04:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh much of like this in our district but
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
I've observed it in other schools we
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
must find funding to support our most
 
04:18:57.149 --> 04:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerable students thank you thank you
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions from the
 
04:18:59.279 --> 04:19:00.670 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions from the
committee

04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:19:03.229 --> 04:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
members not see I don't see any thank
 
04:19:06.750 --> 04:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you uh Becky Wilson
 
04:19:18.309 --> 04:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:19.830 --> 04:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman lad members of
 
04:19:21.389 --> 04:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I'm Becky
 
04:19:22.510 --> 04:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
Wilson from the New Hampshire school
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
boards Association um we are not taking
 
04:19:27.510 --> 04:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
a position on this bill although we
 
04:19:30.269 --> 04:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
certainly support the underlying um goal
 
04:19:31.910 --> 04:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill which is to make sure that
 
04:19:34.349 --> 04:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
students are not taking on uh the
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
consequences perhaps of issues that have
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know adult decisions involved with
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
those I did just want to speak for a
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
moment about the reality of of unpaid
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
lunch balances and to just give some
 
04:19:47.910 --> 04:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
context to the conversation about why
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
the appropriation or the opportunity for
 
04:19:51.870 --> 04:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
this bill to be able to allow the
 
04:19:54.590 --> 04:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
department to draw funds to pay off
 
04:19:56.590 --> 04:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
unpaid lunch balances would certainly
 
04:19:59.349 --> 04:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
support um students not being in the
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
position of having to deal with some of
 
04:20:03.670 --> 04:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
these things um unpaid lunch balances as
 
04:20:06.790 --> 04:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
many of you may know are are a real cost
 
04:20:10.109 --> 04:20:10.119 align:start position:0%
in many districts just last year um some
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
of the districts that we have as members
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
had unpaid lunch balances of
 
04:20:14.720 --> 04:20:16.269 align:start position:0%
had unpaid lunch balances of
$992,000

04:20:16.269 --> 04:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
$992,000
 
04:20:16.279 --> 04:20:18.189 align:start position:0%
$992,000
$61,000

04:20:18.189 --> 04:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
$61,000
 
04:20:18.199 --> 04:20:19.990 align:start position:0%
$61,000
$55,000

04:20:19.990 --> 04:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
$55,000
 
04:20:24.269 --> 04:20:24.279 align:start position:0%
$30,000 39.5 th000 uh one District in
 
04:20:25.710 --> 04:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
the first three months of school has
 
04:20:25.720 --> 04:20:27.269 align:start position:0%
the first three months of school has
acred

04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
acred
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
$15,400 of unpaid lunch balances and
 
04:20:34.349 --> 04:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
$37,000 these are not big districts um
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
other than the 92,000 but these are real
 
04:20:39.389 --> 04:20:39.399 align:start position:0%
funds that the taxpayers and the school
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
boards are having to go back to their
 
04:20:43.229 --> 04:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
local communities to figure out how to
 
04:20:46.269 --> 04:20:46.279 align:start position:0%
handle unpaid lunch balances so
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
certainly the second part of this bill
 
04:20:50.990 --> 04:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
allowing funds to be drawn to pay off by
 
04:20:52.750 --> 04:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
the department these unpaid balances
 
04:20:55.469 --> 04:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
would certain alleviate um some of these
 
04:20:57.149 --> 04:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
issues that I think this bill is trying
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
to address um we certainly want students
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to be fed regardless of what
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
the household income is and things like
 
04:21:08.790 --> 04:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
that um districts I think based off of
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
these numbers they are feeding kids and
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
airing on the side of taking care of
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
students versus making some financially
 
04:21:17.109 --> 04:21:17.119 align:start position:0%
driven decisions um that could be
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
discriminatory or call a student out
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
accidentally Etc um a lot of you know
 
04:21:24.750 --> 04:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
unpaid lunch balances are addressed with
 
04:21:27.590 --> 04:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
families but it is a sensitive situation
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
for school districts to be seeking out
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
financial information from families um
 
04:21:33.910 --> 04:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
even though there are resources the
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
school districts could provide families
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
if they were to need them and perhaps
 
04:21:38.910 --> 04:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
some of these families do qualify for
 
04:21:41.469 --> 04:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
programs that they have not accessed so
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh I just wanted to offer that
 
04:21:43.870 --> 04:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
information to the committee and I'm
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
04:21:47.550 --> 04:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the school
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
boards association yes represent
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:21:54.189 --> 04:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
for being here and uh thank you for
 
04:21:57.750 --> 04:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
testifying as the you know SBA have you
 
04:22:01.469 --> 04:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
ever try to put together a complete
 
04:22:05.109 --> 04:22:05.119 align:start position:0%
summary of school debt between districts
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
maybe for a few years so we could
 
04:22:08.750 --> 04:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
understand the magnitude and the nature
 
04:22:10.990 --> 04:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
of the problem thank you thank you for
 
04:22:13.950 --> 04:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
the question representative um we do try
 
04:22:16.590 --> 04:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
to work um our association with other
 
04:22:18.309 --> 04:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
associations as well in terms of school
 
04:22:21.070 --> 04:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
administrators Etc to gather Uh current
 
04:22:23.149 --> 04:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
data on lots of different issues that
 
04:22:24.670 --> 04:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
this committee and the other education
 
04:22:26.990 --> 04:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
committees address on a fairly regular
 
04:22:29.109 --> 04:22:29.119 align:start position:0%
basis um we do try to get that
 
04:22:32.830 --> 04:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
information it would be um fairly uh
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
accessible for people to go to their
 
04:22:38.109 --> 04:22:38.119 align:start position:0%
local Schoolboard budget and find unpaid
 
04:22:39.710 --> 04:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
lunch balances that is something that
 
04:22:41.910 --> 04:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
comes up at very frequently at
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard meetings um but there is no
 
04:22:46.349 --> 04:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
one place that that is housed so to
 
04:22:48.269 --> 04:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
speak in terms of a
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
Statewide um District comparison of
 
04:22:54.030 --> 04:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
unpaid lunch balances uh also depending
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
on districts participating um as you
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
heard previously in the National
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
programs some districts choose not to
 
04:23:02.990 --> 04:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
simply because the federal program has
 
04:23:05.429 --> 04:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
certain limitations um they don't want
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
those for their students so they opt not
 
04:23:10.149 --> 04:23:10.159 align:start position:0%

04:24:32.149 --> 04:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
you chairman lad and members of the
 
04:24:36.269 --> 04:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
committee um I am Katie Pell uh wol uh
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
representing wolfboro Tuftonboro Carol
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
district 6 um so this this bill
 
04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
um was kind of a concept that was in
 
04:24:47.710 --> 04:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
introduced to me and it took a little
 
04:24:50.070 --> 04:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
bit of time for me to put the work
 
04:24:52.109 --> 04:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
together to get the language in it and
 
04:24:55.469 --> 04:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
it I met with um a representative from
 
04:24:57.870 --> 04:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
sorry an employee of the doe on my on my
 
04:24:59.309 --> 04:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
way in and it might need a little more
 
04:25:01.030 --> 04:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
work than I anticipated so I'm just
 
04:25:03.469 --> 04:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
going to give you a brief overview and
 
04:25:06.269 --> 04:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
he can probably um address any more of
 
04:25:11.070 --> 04:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
the technical details so um the purpose
 
04:25:14.229 --> 04:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
of this is for for accountability and
 
04:25:16.469 --> 04:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
transparency um regarding these federal
 
04:25:19.109 --> 04:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
funds that come in and lack of complete
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what these funds are going
 
04:25:24.030 --> 04:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
are being used for and to clear up some
 
04:25:26.349 --> 04:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
of the ambiguity for the taxpayers and
 
04:25:28.429 --> 04:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
and the parents in the school district
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
so this is all the one of the changes is
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
um that all funds dispersed from a
 
04:25:35.990 --> 04:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
federal governmental unit shall be
 
04:25:38.030 --> 04:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
deemed to be unanticipated under the
 
04:25:41.630 --> 04:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
provisions of this section and that is
 
04:25:44.750 --> 04:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
um to be uh using the example of the
 
04:25:47.710 --> 04:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
Esser funds as a situation where they
 
04:25:47.720 --> 04:25:48.550 align:start position:0%
Esser funds as a situation where they
were

04:25:48.550 --> 04:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:25:52.109 --> 04:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
originally um anticipated for the course
 
04:25:54.790 --> 04:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
of three years but the purpose of the
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
Esser funds was changing so um sometimes
 
04:26:00.269 --> 04:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
those funds were coming in and um wasn't
 
04:26:02.510 --> 04:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
always clear what they were being used
 
04:26:06.429 --> 04:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
for and then we're also adding um that
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
such notice shall contain a summary of
 
04:26:10.510 --> 04:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
any obligations incurred by accepting
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
the unanticipated funds or state that
 
04:26:14.830 --> 04:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
there are no obligations in curred so
 
04:26:18.309 --> 04:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's very clear what um what the strings
 
04:26:20.830 --> 04:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
are that are attached to receiving the
 
04:26:23.710 --> 04:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
funds and the other um thing is that the
 
04:26:25.590 --> 04:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
other part of this is that the minutes
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
of the board shall contain a summary of
 
04:26:30.109 --> 04:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
any obligations so that any taxpayer who
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at the minutes of the
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
meeting has a clear understanding of the
 
04:26:35.870 --> 04:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
purpose of the funds and what they're
 
04:26:38.109 --> 04:26:38.119 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be used for so
 
04:26:41.070 --> 04:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
that's essentially it um and I did want
 
04:26:44.830 --> 04:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
to give one sort of a Kudos if you will
 
04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%

04:26:48.790 --> 04:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
Association and just say yes for
 
04:26:50.429 --> 04:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
something to be accountable and
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
transparent parents and taxpayers need
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
to show up at their Schoolboard
 
04:26:59.790 --> 04:26:59.800 align:start position:0%

the federal government title one and um
 
04:27:58.710 --> 04:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
title two that under normal
 
04:28:01.469 --> 04:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances and the covid situation
 
04:28:05.670 --> 04:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
was not normal that those funds are
 
04:28:08.269 --> 04:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
anticipated and put in the local school
 
04:28:10.109 --> 04:28:10.119 align:start position:0%
budget that gets voted
 
04:28:12.790 --> 04:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
on um and that
 
04:28:15.590 --> 04:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
what that money is used
 
04:28:20.309 --> 04:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
for uh it's not going to have
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
detailed information in the minutes but
 
04:28:28.630 --> 04:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
in very very detailed explanations of
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
every dollar the State Department of
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
Education uh
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
collects um a budget from the school
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
district on how they're planning to
 
04:28:42.070 --> 04:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
spend that fund and that they get
 
04:28:44.189 --> 04:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for spending it in though all
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
those different minute categories and if
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
they want to make any changes to the
 
04:28:52.710 --> 04:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
budget that that gets approved
 
04:28:56.590 --> 04:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
also thank you for the question on the
 
04:29:00.309 --> 04:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
way in I believe your successor from the
 
04:29:03.149 --> 04:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
doe explained all of that to me so he
 
04:29:05.469 --> 04:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
can probably and go into that in further
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
detail thank you representative P I have
 
04:29:12.149 --> 04:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
one question for you here uh if I as a
 
04:29:15.269 --> 04:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
School District received These funds and
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
my school board approves the use of them
 
04:29:22.630 --> 04:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
must I consider any future obligations
 
04:29:24.630 --> 04:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
that the result of the using these funds
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
May incur be incurred by the district IE
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
labor I would think so that's that's as
 
04:29:36.830 --> 04:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
much as I can elaborate I would think so
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah future obligations yes that's what
 
04:29:40.750 --> 04:29:40.760 align:start position:0%

04:30:50.910 --> 04:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
um what obligations people bring to the
 
04:30:54.030 --> 04:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
table um without letting anything out of
 
04:30:56.429 --> 04:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
the bag there I did hear recently of a
 
04:30:59.830 --> 04:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
town that had to um may
 
04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
may stop the deal because of the
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
obligations that they had that um the
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
other school didn't know about and it
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
may be the the um the killer on making
 
04:31:13.189 --> 04:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
some strides towards murder in merg yeah
 
04:31:18.109 --> 04:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
merging um it's it's important for
 
04:31:20.149 --> 04:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
transparency and especially in the time
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
we're asking on the other education
 
04:31:23.950 --> 04:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh we're talking about
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
consolidation of seus and and
 
04:31:28.469 --> 04:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
consolidation of districts and I think
 
04:31:29.910 --> 04:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
that that everybody needs to bring to
 
04:31:31.790 --> 04:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
the table all the obligations that they
 
04:31:34.870 --> 04:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
have so that we can make a fair
 
04:31:38.109 --> 04:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
decision thank you thank you any any
 
04:31:41.229 --> 04:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
questions yes repres McGuire thank you
 
04:31:43.389 --> 04:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative can you be more specific
 
04:31:51.469 --> 04:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
in in your example of um what kind of
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
money came in and what kind of
 
04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
obligation was assumed I mean just
 
04:31:57.790 --> 04:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm unfamiliar with this
 
04:32:00.990 --> 04:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I think um I think it's more along
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
the lines of um and I'm not really sure
 
04:32:06.750 --> 04:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
I just heard about this so um of what
 
04:32:10.349 --> 04:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
obligations were uh maybe expected from
 
04:32:12.990 --> 04:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
the money and it made differ uh the
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
paths May differ in the people that are
 
04:32:17.550 --> 04:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
trying to merge that's where it's good
 
04:32:19.109 --> 04:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
to know what they're what they're
 
04:32:21.870 --> 04:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
expecting to do with with money or the
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
04:32:28.109 --> 04:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
it does that help you yes okay so no I
 
04:32:31.149 --> 04:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
meant more like I don't know the federal
 
04:32:35.269 --> 04:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
government gives you $50,000 this year
 
04:32:38.429 --> 04:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
but it requires you to hire for 10 years
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
a new PE teacher or something you know
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
what I mean is it something like that or
 
04:32:44.830 --> 04:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
is it I think full disclosure is good if
 
04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
you think that you have obligations on
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
money that we're going to you're going
 
04:32:51.109 --> 04:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
to add somebody else to take along this
 
04:32:53.389 --> 04:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
with you um they need to know what
 
04:32:55.550 --> 04:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
obligations you have kind of like full
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:03.790 --> 04:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
house represent fellows um yes I'm my
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
question is along that same line because
 
04:33:07.680 --> 04:33:09.230 align:start position:0%
question is along that same line because
the

04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:11.949 --> 04:33:11.959 align:start position:0%
only situation I can think of for
 
04:33:15.990 --> 04:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
Federal money that had a really
 
04:33:19.310 --> 04:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
multi-year um you know more than beyond
 
04:33:23.590 --> 04:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
the next year or so obligation was is
 
04:33:26.590 --> 04:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
Charter School startup money regular
 
04:33:31.269 --> 04:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
school districts I I don't think for
 
04:33:34.990 --> 04:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
their Title One money that is doesn't
 
04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
work that way it wouldn't be that kind
 
04:33:38.470 --> 04:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
of obligation that would be far ahead
 
04:33:40.029 --> 04:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
and whenever there's a merger that
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen overnight so yeah that's
 
04:33:45.269 --> 04:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
true so can does that help you can does
 
04:33:48.150 --> 04:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
that help you explain what this
 
04:33:50.670 --> 04:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
situation could be no we're talking
 
04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
about Federal money here yes okay that
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
that may make a difference maybe I'll
 
04:33:57.551 --> 04:33:57.561 align:start position:0%
just up here to say transparency helps
 
04:33:59.310 --> 04:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh this is a good bill because it's
 
04:34:01.949 --> 04:34:01.959 align:start position:0%
pushing that concept and if you have to
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
work out the business with Title One
 
04:34:07.470 --> 04:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
money like representative pel said um
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:13.390 --> 04:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
road okay thank thank you I'm going to
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
follow up with a question I just to try
 
04:34:18.510 --> 04:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
and qualify what I was trying to say
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
earlier if I receive eser monies in a
 
04:34:24.269 --> 04:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
school district and I'm complying with
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
federal law so I'm able to hire this
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
individual who may be a par
 
04:34:32.510 --> 04:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
professional if I don't put in the
 
04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
contract with that parah or the
 
04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
agreement that this is only for two or
 
04:34:39.189 --> 04:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
three years and I don't have that
 
04:34:41.949 --> 04:34:41.959 align:start position:0%
language in there what's going to happen
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
when you get to the end of the three
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
years and that person's become a part of
 
04:34:51.629 --> 04:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
that school is that in making an
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
obligation that's going to incur that
 
04:34:58.150 --> 04:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
District into having to pay then raise
 
04:35:02.189 --> 04:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
the the next fourth year from property
 
04:35:06.269 --> 04:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
taxes sounds to me like that's the
 
04:35:06.279 --> 04:35:09.189 align:start position:0%
taxes sounds to me like that's the
case

04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
yeah represent no s so thank you thank
 
04:35:14.910 --> 04:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair I I just want to
 
04:35:18.029 --> 04:35:18.039 align:start position:0%
um uh poke on on representative lad's
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
question a little bit more and your
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
answer so are you saying that under no
 
04:35:25.390 --> 04:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances after a um after employees
 
04:35:28.949 --> 04:35:28.959 align:start position:0%
contract has expired um as a result of a
 
04:35:31.349 --> 04:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
grant expiration that the school board
 
04:35:34.230 --> 04:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
would not have the authority to um to
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
non-renew that contract are you saying
 
04:35:37.789 --> 04:35:37.799 align:start position:0%
the school board does not under current
 
04:35:41.629 --> 04:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
law have the authority to do that to not
 
04:35:44.590 --> 04:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
non-renew to non non-renew a contract
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
after it's expired and after funding has
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
run out from Federal
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
grant no not necessarily not necessarily
 
04:35:53.230 --> 04:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
that the school board does not have
 
04:35:55.230 --> 04:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
Authority or the school board does have
 
04:35:58.029 --> 04:35:58.039 align:start position:0%
the authority to non-renew a
 
04:36:00.551 --> 04:36:00.561 align:start position:0%
contract the single School we're talking
 
04:36:01.869 --> 04:36:01.879 align:start position:0%
about one school district not talking
 
04:36:03.910 --> 04:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
about school district non-renewing a
 
04:36:05.590 --> 04:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
contract in the case that representative
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
lad just talked about was funded for
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
multiple years through a Federal Grant
 
04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
and it and it states CLE L on the
 
04:36:13.990 --> 04:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
contract as all the ones that I've ever
 
04:36:16.109 --> 04:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
signed being chair of the school board
 
04:36:18.310 --> 04:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
that this this contract is being issued
 
04:36:20.949 --> 04:36:20.959 align:start position:0%
subject to a Federal Grant and um and is
 
04:36:23.230 --> 04:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
subject to non-renewal um uh following
 
04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
the termination following the completion
 
04:36:26.670 --> 04:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
of the grant are you saying that school
 
04:36:30.029 --> 04:36:30.039 align:start position:0%
boards don't have the authority to to
 
04:36:32.910 --> 04:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
non-renew a contract no because you just
 
04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
said that they could they they clearly
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
do and you just said that maybe they
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
don't to representative lad's
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
question they school boards clearly have
 
04:36:44.709 --> 04:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
the authority if you've got the answer
 
04:36:47.230 --> 04:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
to your question then that's not well
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
well then a followup on that I think
 
04:36:51.269 --> 04:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
you've had a
 
04:36:56.230 --> 04:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
followup Point um further questions yes
 
04:36:58.830 --> 04:36:58.840 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my
 
04:37:03.551 --> 04:37:03.561 align:start position:0%
question can you share with us what
 
04:37:06.349 --> 04:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
percent of funding for New Hampshire
 
04:37:09.310 --> 04:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
Public Schools comes from federal grants
 
04:37:10.510 --> 04:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know that
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
number do you know it as a dollar figure
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't but she
 
04:37:22.990 --> 04:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
might it's not her daily way represent
 
04:37:25.230 --> 04:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
fellow so do you think that maybe it's
 
04:37:29.830 --> 04:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
7% or around that figure possibly it is
 
04:37:32.150 --> 04:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%

04:37:50.070 --> 04:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman lad members of
 
04:37:51.470 --> 04:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record Becky
 
04:37:52.709 --> 04:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
Wilson from the New Hampshire school
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
boards Association uh we are in
 
04:37:56.670 --> 04:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill as it is
 
04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
currently written uh if the bill does
 
04:38:01.590 --> 04:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
move forward we have a lot of questions
 
04:38:04.109 --> 04:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
about what this would mean for districts
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
um we certainly understand the need for
 
04:38:08.470 --> 04:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
transparency and wanting uh local
 
04:38:10.349 --> 04:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
community members and parents to attend
 
04:38:11.869 --> 04:38:11.879 align:start position:0%
local Schoolboard meetings to the
 
04:38:13.510 --> 04:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
representatives Point earlier is
 
04:38:15.390 --> 04:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
something that we would love to have
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of involvement however we're
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
confused about whether or not this bill
 
04:38:21.390 --> 04:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
if it's enacted the way that it's
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
currently written means that districts
 
04:38:26.109 --> 04:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
need to budget all of the monies that
 
04:38:27.551 --> 04:38:27.561 align:start position:0%
they're currently receiving through
 
04:38:29.310 --> 04:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
federal grants into their operating
 
04:38:32.070 --> 04:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
budget and have that raised locally uh
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
by their local communities that would be
 
04:38:35.670 --> 04:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
a very large burden for a lot of
 
04:38:37.709 --> 04:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
communities to take the money they're
 
04:38:40.029 --> 04:38:40.039 align:start position:0%
currently anticipating although it's not
 
04:38:42.189 --> 04:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
a for sure dollar amount that they are
 
04:38:44.310 --> 04:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
counting on through these other grants
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
things like idea grants right now in the
 
04:38:49.150 --> 04:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
state I think idea allocations to the
 
04:38:51.750 --> 04:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
districts are about $50 million I think
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
title one is around $45
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
million um I'm not sure what other
 
04:38:57.789 --> 04:38:57.799 align:start position:0%
federal grants would fall under this
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill but it's a significant amount of
 
04:39:01.470 --> 04:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
money that would then need to be I
 
04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
believe somehow incorporated into
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
District's operating budgets with no um
 
04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
guarantee or act as if there's no
 
04:39:10.189 --> 04:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they're going to get any
 
04:39:12.070 --> 04:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
of these funds through these federal
 
04:39:14.189 --> 04:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
grants uh most of the federal grants
 
04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
also do require uh a maintenance of
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
effort meaning if you're going to put
 
04:39:21.029 --> 04:39:21.039 align:start position:0%
something into place through a grant
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
that you are anticipating maintaining
 
04:39:25.150 --> 04:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
over time or a resource to families you
 
04:39:27.551 --> 04:39:27.561 align:start position:0%
do have to somehow account for that
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
moving forward in your operating budget
 
04:39:31.029 --> 04:39:31.039 align:start position:0%
to ensure that you're not just providing
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
something and then taking it away from
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
students and families uh in the future
 
04:39:39.390 --> 04:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
but you can to the previous question um
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
as a person's contract that is solely
 
04:39:43.550 --> 04:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
funded by a grant make sure that that is
 
04:39:45.390 --> 04:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
known and then when that Grant is over
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
you that position would be no longer um
 
04:39:50.830 --> 04:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
maintained by the district uh Grant
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
activities are also already deeply
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
approved by the New Hampshire Department
 
04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
of Education to ensure that they are
 
04:39:59.070 --> 04:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
allowable activities based on the grant
 
04:40:00.910 --> 04:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
um the goals of the grants and the
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
outlines of each Grant um every single
 
04:40:05.150 --> 04:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
activity in those grants that districts
 
04:40:07.310 --> 04:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
are applying for or are allocated
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
through uh have to be approved down to
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
the penny it's fairly specific so that
 
04:40:14.470 --> 04:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
information is available if anyone were
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
to ask for it in your District um and
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
you certainly cannot supplant things
 
04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
from your budget into grants fully you
 
04:40:22.708 --> 04:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
can only supplement with the grant I'm
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions further
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
questions representa
 
04:40:28.868 --> 04:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question which I wish I
 
04:40:33.628 --> 04:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
thought of asking previously are you
 
04:40:37.628 --> 04:40:37.638 align:start position:0%
aware of any situations in recent years
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
where a district planned on grant
 
04:40:42.190 --> 04:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
funding and then didn't receive it and
 
04:40:43.590 --> 04:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
there were costs incourage to the
 
04:40:45.750 --> 04:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
district because of that uh thank you
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative there are there's a
 
04:40:51.070 --> 04:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
difference between federal grants that
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
are anticipated and allocated to the
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
district on a regular basis idea things
 
04:40:58.430 --> 04:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
like that versus a competitive Grant
 
04:40:59.830 --> 04:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
where perhaps you would be part of a
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
process where you're applying for a
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
grant as a district and you may or may
 
04:41:06.070 --> 04:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
not get it um districts make decisions
 
04:41:08.110 --> 04:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
based on what they put in place prior to
 
04:41:09.948 --> 04:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
applying for those competitive grants
 
04:41:12.190 --> 04:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
meaning if they f it was important to
 
04:41:14.270 --> 04:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
put something into their school district
 
04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
and fund it regardless of where the
 
04:41:17.628 --> 04:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
funding is coming from I think districts
 
04:41:19.590 --> 04:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
would do that if it is based solely on
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not they win a competitive
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
Grant or are allowed certain allocations
 
04:41:25.628 --> 04:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
off of a grant that is a new like the
 
04:41:27.948 --> 04:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
safe grants for example uh for building
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
safety things like that that's up that's
 
04:41:32.110 --> 04:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
a district decision to decide whether or
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
not to move forward with costs that they
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
may or may not have Grant support
 
04:41:41.470 --> 04:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
for thank you represent spilsbury thank
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um it seems like a
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward bill it's making
 
04:41:51.788 --> 04:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
three very small changes to notice
 
04:41:54.150 --> 04:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
requirements so it's been described as a
 
04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
full disclosure uh
 
04:42:01.788 --> 04:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
Bill if it's only requiring that the
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
notice given includes a summary of
 
04:42:06.190 --> 04:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
obligations and that the minutes that
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
are already required includes that
 
04:42:11.310 --> 04:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
summary can you point us to the language
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
gives the association
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
pause thank you for the question
 
04:42:17.670 --> 04:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative I think that this while
 
04:42:19.270 --> 04:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
it does seem straightforward in terms of
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
its intention and I hear that from the
 
04:42:23.830 --> 04:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative sponsors on this bill I
 
04:42:26.830 --> 04:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
think it is a bit confusing to say that
 
04:42:28.948 --> 04:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
what obligations are incurred by taking
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
for example Federal idea
 
04:42:34.948 --> 04:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
funds those those are federal funds that
 
04:42:38.110 --> 04:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
the districts are already um you know
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
that are set aside for districts to be
 
04:42:41.788 --> 04:42:41.798 align:start position:0%
able to offset their C for special
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
education for example or Title One um
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know what you're providing with
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
those Services I would imagine would be
 
04:42:50.430 --> 04:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
the obligations that you're incurring so
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
to speak which is that you're going to
 
04:42:54.030 --> 04:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
provide special ed services in
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
accordance with the law or you're going
 
04:42:58.110 --> 04:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
to provide Title One support in
 
04:42:59.708 --> 04:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
accordance with the title one act but
 
04:43:02.510 --> 04:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what beyond that um this
 
04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
bill would be seeking to
 
04:43:07.948 --> 04:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
publicize follow up sure so I'm just
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
trying to understand and see whether the
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
objection is one that can be
 
04:43:15.788 --> 04:43:15.798 align:start position:0%
addressed it sounds like your concern is
 
04:43:19.390 --> 04:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
in line six and seven in the way that
 
04:43:22.070 --> 04:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
the term funds dispersed from a federal
 
04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
government unit is used is is that
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
really the point that that somehow is
 
04:43:29.788 --> 04:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
not sufficiently described or bounded
 
04:43:31.750 --> 04:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I do think
 
04:43:34.430 --> 04:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
that it is UN unclear to local school
 
04:43:36.350 --> 04:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
board members as to what would what
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
would fall under any all funds dispersed
 
04:43:40.350 --> 04:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
from a federal government unit does that
 
04:43:42.470 --> 04:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
mean all of grants is it just
 
04:43:45.628 --> 04:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
competitive grants is it un for example
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
the SR money or some of those things
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
that were in response to the to the
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
times as opposed to something that is an
 
04:43:53.190 --> 04:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing grant that districts are used to
 
04:43:55.550 --> 04:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
getting over time well thank you so I
 
04:43:57.470 --> 04:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
think that allows us to put a focus on
 
04:43:59.470 --> 04:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
those that
 
04:44:01.948 --> 04:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
phrase further questions yes represent
 
04:44:04.110 --> 04:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair I'll be very
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
brief thank you for taking my question
 
04:44:05.638 --> 04:44:08.070 align:start position:0%
brief thank you for taking my question
and

04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:10.550 --> 04:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
testifying given that you are probably
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
one of the more knowledgeable people in
 
04:44:15.270 --> 04:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
the state in terms of what schools do
 
04:44:18.310 --> 04:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
and that your answer a bit earlier was I
 
04:44:21.750 --> 04:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
imagine that it's about in this ballpark
 
04:44:24.270 --> 04:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there be value in your opinion
 
04:44:26.110 --> 04:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers to have a clear
 
04:44:28.350 --> 04:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
accounting from the district as to what
 
04:44:30.788 --> 04:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
those obligations are instead of them
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
having to apply their much less
 
04:44:35.470 --> 04:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable Minds to the problem and
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
try to guess what it
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
is isn't that value to the taxpayer just
 
04:44:41.788 --> 04:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
trying to understand end your stance
 
04:44:44.990 --> 04:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative I believe that this body
 
04:44:49.708 --> 04:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
just last year passed a bill that will
 
04:44:51.230 --> 04:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
require certain things to be posted on
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
the district website in terms of what
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
allocations are already being provided
 
04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
to the district from the Department of
 
04:44:58.510 --> 04:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
Education which is the flowr for all of
 
04:45:02.310 --> 04:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
these funds so I'm not sure I mean it's
 
04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
very specific in terms of what is posted
 
04:45:06.628 --> 04:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
and how it's labeled I'm not sure what
 
04:45:09.030 --> 04:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
beyond that you're you would be looking
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
for districts to be providing to the
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
community members in terms of making
 
04:45:15.788 --> 04:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
sure that the transparency that this
 
04:45:17.310 --> 04:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
bill is seeking is
 
04:45:20.190 --> 04:45:20.200 align:start position:0%

understanding uh potential obligations

04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
communication with the community and

between superintendent and School Board

running effective meetings um ensuring
 
04:46:12.390 --> 04:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
that there's strong communication all of
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
those pieces would fall under I believe
 
04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
making sure that local school board
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
members understand their obligations
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
when they are dealing with the Manifest
 
04:46:23.788 --> 04:46:23.798 align:start position:0%
monthly when they are signing off on

those things when they're taking actions
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
at their local Schoolboard meetings on
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%

yeah there you go thank you chairman lad
 
04:47:28.270 --> 04:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm darus hoeny
 
04:47:29.670 --> 04:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
a former nationville School Board member
 
04:47:31.990 --> 04:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm here in support in my four years
 
04:47:33.948 --> 04:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
on the school board never once did the
 
04:47:35.470 --> 04:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
administration come to the board in
 
04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
advance asking for input on an
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
application for a Federal grant we were
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
only notified after after the grant was
 
04:47:44.030 --> 04:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
awarded and administration needed our
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
vote to accept the money details were
 
04:47:49.628 --> 04:47:49.638 align:start position:0%
always minimal and my understanding was
 
04:47:51.310 --> 04:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
there were many times when it would
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
include a position it didn't say you had
 
04:47:55.628 --> 04:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
to keep it but that was the Assumption
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
when you get a new director of something
 
04:47:59.910 --> 04:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the grant now you have a new position
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
going forward but there may be a variety
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
of different grants when asked why the
 
04:48:06.190 --> 04:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
administration couldn't come to the
 
04:48:09.548 --> 04:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
board sooner um to have input into the
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
application the excuse of was the
 
04:48:12.510 --> 04:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
deadlines are imminent so there was
 
04:48:13.948 --> 04:48:13.958 align:start position:0%
never time to seek guidance from the
 
04:48:15.990 --> 04:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
board these federal funds were like the
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
administration's own little slush fund
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
that could predetermine how they would
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
like the money
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
spent the commissioner of Education
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
created a document for districts asking
 
04:48:28.230 --> 04:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
the superintendent and the board
 
04:48:31.150 --> 04:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
president to certify that school board
 
04:48:33.070 --> 04:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
was fully informed of federal funds
 
04:48:35.310 --> 04:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
coming into the district it was a great
 
04:48:37.750 --> 04:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
idea apparently my district signed and
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
certified the board that the board was
 
04:48:41.230 --> 04:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
fully informed without notifying the
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
board of any federal funds when caught
 
04:48:44.948 --> 04:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
in this fraud I was accused of
 
04:48:46.548 --> 04:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
destroying the district as the federal
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
funds from the state were stopped for a
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
whole week nothing ever happened to
 
04:48:52.150 --> 04:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
those committing the fraud and the board
 
04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
was barely informed of the federal funds
 
04:48:56.310 --> 04:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
coming to the district anything you can
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
do to make this process more transparent
 
04:49:00.190 --> 04:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated in fact I'd like a
 
04:49:01.948 --> 04:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
study to determine if any of the federal
 
04:49:04.390 --> 04:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
funds are costeffective given that only
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
88.4% according to the department's
 
04:49:10.390 --> 04:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
website of the education revenue or 336
 
04:49:10.400 --> 04:49:11.548 align:start position:0%
website of the education revenue or 336
million

04:49:11.548 --> 04:49:11.558 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
um comes from federal funds how much
 
04:49:16.270 --> 04:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
does it cost districts to implement
 
04:49:18.030 --> 04:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
these Federal programs and restoring
 
04:49:20.230 --> 04:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
local control over curriculum would
 
04:49:22.270 --> 04:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
encourage diversity of instruction
 
04:49:23.830 --> 04:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate Data Tracking that would
 
04:49:26.070 --> 04:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
respect the new privacy amendment to our
 
04:49:28.868 --> 04:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
constitution thank you for your time and
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
attention Doris do you want to take any
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
questions sure you have any any
 
04:49:35.230 --> 04:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:49:38.470 --> 04:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent BB I'm thinking
 
04:49:40.750 --> 04:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
of another bill that I sponsored which
 
04:49:42.628 --> 04:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
is in the education policy and
 
04:49:44.750 --> 04:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
administration committee and I'm
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you think there should
 
04:49:50.910 --> 04:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
be more explicit language in law
 
04:49:52.628 --> 04:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
defining the extent of the budget
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee's role and what the school
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
board and superintendent must bring to
 
04:50:00.190 --> 04:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
the budget committee before it's agreed
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking outside the budget cycle
 
04:50:04.990 --> 04:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
things that occur during the year thank
 
04:50:07.150 --> 04:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
you for your question I'm in a city so
 
04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have Town budgets Town voting
 
04:50:14.590 --> 04:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
we get delet well in January the
 
04:50:16.628 --> 04:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
superintendent comes with a proposed
 
04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
budget which he gives us in pieces week
 
04:50:21.628 --> 04:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
by week we don't get the whole thing we
 
04:50:24.510 --> 04:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
just get his summary takes us four to
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
six weeks for him to go through and for
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
us to try to get some detail it's really
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
hard when you have 17 schools in one
 
04:50:35.470 --> 04:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
District it's it's really hard I never
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
got sufficient information federal funds
 
04:50:41.470 --> 04:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
is anything you can do to
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
useful thank you yeah I I just have one
 
04:50:52.788 --> 04:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
you you spoke of these federal funds and
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
my memory servicing back to co and all
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
that esm money that came down is this
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
bill partially a result of
 
04:51:03.430 --> 04:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent spending money even with
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.670 --> 04:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
on is that question well I said is this
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill a result
 
04:51:18.350 --> 04:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
of the way the federal government set up
 
04:51:20.548 --> 04:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
the Essa which was really done in a very
 
04:51:24.510 --> 04:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
quick fashion that monies came down and
 
04:51:26.788 --> 04:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
there were some cases in which those
 
04:51:28.628 --> 04:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
monies were being and there was a very
 
04:51:31.708 --> 04:51:31.718 align:start position:0%
broad list of how things could be used
 
04:51:32.788 --> 04:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
and for
 
04:51:36.670 --> 04:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
what and it was the understanding that
 
04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
the superintendent administrators could
 
04:51:41.310 --> 04:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
make the decision how those fun it did
 
04:51:43.948 --> 04:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
not go to school boards so the
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
transparency is that so that there were
 
04:51:48.628 --> 04:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
somewhere they weren't even formed that
 
04:51:50.830 --> 04:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
they had this money and it's being
 
04:51:53.830 --> 04:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
spent are you aware thank you for the
 
04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
question I think it's interesting I was
 
04:51:57.310 --> 04:51:57.320 align:start position:0%
off the board at that time the boards
 
04:51:59.310 --> 04:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
were not meeting in person they were
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
meeting over Zoom information transfer
 
04:52:06.788 --> 04:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
was minimal um Essa is a very strange
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
animal passed in
 
04:52:13.788 --> 04:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
2015 as comes in in 2019 and it somehow
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
mandates something that came four years
 
04:52:17.628 --> 04:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
later they don't go back to Congress
 
04:52:20.670 --> 04:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
they it just Essa keeps blooming yeah I
 
04:52:22.030 --> 04:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me I wasn't talking ESS if I was
 
04:52:24.390 --> 04:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
talking AR but go go for monies Co money
 
04:52:26.750 --> 04:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
through Essa you said Co money yes I
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't there
 
04:52:28.320 --> 04:52:30.230 align:start position:0%
wasn't there
yeah

04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
yeah further
 
04:52:34.190 --> 04:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay we have one more card
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:46.910 --> 04:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Amry Banfield I'm a
 
04:52:48.868 --> 04:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
parental rights Advocate New Hampshire
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
focused on excellence and
 
04:52:54.510 --> 04:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
education I have 91a many of these
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
grants and read through them and was
 
04:53:00.470 --> 04:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
appalled not because of what they intend
 
04:53:02.708 --> 04:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
to do but a lot of times it's what's
 
04:53:06.190 --> 04:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
missing um and again I look at it from a
 
04:53:09.070 --> 04:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
parental rights perspective so sometimes
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm focused in on
 
04:53:14.548 --> 04:53:14.558 align:start position:0%
for instance Nelly May uh receives Grant
 
04:53:15.868 --> 04:53:15.878 align:start position:0%
or receives money from The Gates
 
04:53:17.350 --> 04:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
Foundation and the federal government
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
and Nelly May is one of the grant
 
04:53:20.750 --> 04:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
foundations that come into our school
 
04:53:22.590 --> 04:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
and you may not know this but they
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
actually dictate teaching methods in the
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
classroom when those grants come into
 
04:53:29.788 --> 04:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
the into the school so reading the
 
04:53:33.830 --> 04:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
details of a grant is I just can't even
 
04:53:36.070 --> 04:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
believe that that's not
 
04:53:37.830 --> 04:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
happening quite frankly I think it
 
04:53:39.590 --> 04:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
should be put on the website I think we
 
04:53:41.190 --> 04:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
I think everybody should be able to
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
access it and just think you wouldn't
 
04:53:44.670 --> 04:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
have to 91a it you wouldn't have to take
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
their time so transparency is what I
 
04:53:49.390 --> 04:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
like about this I'd love it on the
 
04:53:53.190 --> 04:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
website but that's me um so I've you
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to kind of focus in on um
 
04:53:58.788 --> 04:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
one of this grants because I think that
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
I can explain why this is so important
 
04:54:04.948 --> 04:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
so uh Manchester received Community
 
04:54:08.590 --> 04:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
School Grants Community School is a CDC
 
04:54:11.150 --> 04:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
model so that means going to take the
 
04:54:13.310 --> 04:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
school and what used to be the education
 
04:54:16.110 --> 04:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
focused on education we're now going to
 
04:54:19.230 --> 04:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
incorporate medical services and mental
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
health services so it's One-Stop
 
04:54:22.990 --> 04:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
shopping for your
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
child um if you want an example of where
 
04:54:30.110 --> 04:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
this where a uh there's been a problem
 
04:54:33.150 --> 04:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
with school boards not seeing other than
 
04:54:35.590 --> 04:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
U Mrs hoeny what she what she brought to
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
you uh just a few months ago in seab
 
04:54:41.670 --> 04:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
Brook uh they had accepted a community
 
04:54:46.230 --> 04:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
school Grant and the board then voted to
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
get rid of the grant because they didn't
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
like the details the details that they
 
04:54:52.628 --> 04:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
didn't know about that were not shared
 
04:54:56.350 --> 04:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
with them by the administration so once
 
04:54:58.150 --> 04:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
they figured out once they saw the
 
04:55:00.270 --> 04:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
details they then rejected it you can go
 
04:55:02.030 --> 04:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
back to the minutes you can talk to this
 
04:55:04.510 --> 04:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
to the school board members about that
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
they then also voted to uh look at all
 
04:55:12.670 --> 04:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
grants above $225,000 so that is now a
 
04:55:16.310 --> 04:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
policy uh first of all Community Schools
 
04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of statutory authority to
 
04:55:21.270 --> 04:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
even have them I know that they with
 
04:55:23.830 --> 04:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
their statutory authority to hire a
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
school nurse but this is a fundamental
 
04:55:29.990 --> 04:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
change to our education system and it's
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
coming into our schools already with
 
04:55:32.718 --> 04:55:34.910 align:start position:0%
coming into our schools already with
Federal

04:55:34.910 --> 04:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
04:55:37.868 --> 04:55:37.878 align:start position:0%
money Massachusetts has an extensive
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
statute on Community Schools but I'm
 
04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
going to tell you in Maine for instance
 
04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
Maine has many school-based health
 
04:55:48.628 --> 04:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
clinics and I'll give an example there a
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
father went in and or I'm sorry a
 
04:55:53.590 --> 04:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
daughter brought home a little bag of
 
04:55:56.070 --> 04:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
pills and father said what are those
 
04:55:58.628 --> 04:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
pills and she said well they prescrib
 
04:55:59.548 --> 04:55:59.558 align:start position:0%
them at
 
04:56:01.470 --> 04:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
school and he found out that they're
 
04:56:04.548 --> 04:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
Zoloft and zolof does um is a u
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
anti-depressant and it causes um
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
suicidal thoughts and my point is he
 
04:56:13.070 --> 04:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
went into the school found out from the
 
04:56:15.670 --> 04:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
administrator that oh we don't do this
 
04:56:17.070 --> 04:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
this is school-based Health Clinic where
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
we got our Federal Grant from goes to
 
04:56:23.350 --> 04:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
that entity they tell him we don't have
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
to get your consent this is federal
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
money we don't need your consent he
 
04:56:30.750 --> 04:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
withdraws his daughter and Children
 
04:56:33.310 --> 04:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
Services come and visit him which he was
 
04:56:33.320 --> 04:56:35.990 align:start position:0%
Services come and visit him which he was
then

04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
exonerated So within this grant uh
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you another example so
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the wording in the
 
04:56:47.070 --> 04:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
grant talks
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
about the behavioral health Improvement
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
Institute at Keen State College will
 
04:56:53.948 --> 04:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
serve as the outside evaluator for
 
04:56:56.110 --> 04:56:56.120 align:start position:0%
measuring performance pipeline services
 
04:56:58.788 --> 04:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
and local outcomes that's part of the
 
04:57:01.868 --> 04:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
community Grant to the Manchester
 
04:57:04.270 --> 04:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
schools now does anybody have any
 
04:57:06.628 --> 04:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
concerns about Keen State College
 
04:57:09.708 --> 04:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
Behavior Institute probably none of you
 
04:57:13.350 --> 04:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
do you may not know this but they are
 
04:57:15.670 --> 04:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
they are the outside Authority who
 
04:57:17.628 --> 04:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
reports back to the federal government
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
on how these grants are working in the
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
school and so just a short time ago
 
04:57:26.670 --> 04:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
maybe about a year ago uh we determined
 
04:57:29.350 --> 04:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
or we found out that Keen state was
 
04:57:31.190 --> 04:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
receiving personally identifiable
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
information on students mental health
 
04:57:37.030 --> 04:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
without parental consent without student
 
04:57:37.040 --> 04:57:40.510 align:start position:0%
without parental consent without student
consent

04:57:40.510 --> 04:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
so there's a problem so this is in their
 
04:57:45.670 --> 04:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
Grant CH so I Mr chair point of order
 
04:57:47.470 --> 04:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
what's your point of order um the bill
 
04:57:51.070 --> 04:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
talks about um any obligations inur U
 
04:57:53.590 --> 04:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
incurred by accepting um unanticipated
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
funds it doesn't talk about specific
 
04:57:57.510 --> 04:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
detail associated with the grant so
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
these are just stories that I think are
 
04:58:02.948 --> 04:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
anecdotal to the um stories that are
 
04:58:04.548 --> 04:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
reinforcing the rationale for the
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
purpose of of the bill um no because the
 
04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is is is
 
04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
obligations incurred by the school
 
04:58:15.548 --> 04:58:15.558 align:start position:0%
district by accepting the unanticipated
 
04:58:18.910 --> 04:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
funds it's not about um I'm not I'm not
 
04:58:20.270 --> 04:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
going to accept this parliamentary
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
inquiry I don't feel that the person
 
04:58:23.948 --> 04:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
testifying is straying off the path I
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
would ask her to continue thank you Mr
 
04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
chair so as I go through this Grant and
 
04:58:32.948 --> 04:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
again I look at from a parental rights
 
04:58:35.070 --> 04:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
perspective uh one of the things I look
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
for is parental consent when they're now
 
04:58:39.510 --> 04:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
going to service a child for their
 
04:58:41.350 --> 04:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
medical needs or their mental health
 
04:58:44.590 --> 04:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
needs and in this particular Grant to
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
for Manchester there is language
 
04:58:49.948 --> 04:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
fortunately that requires parental
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
consent but the problem is that I saw
 
04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
was it's is this a blanket consent form
 
04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
or is this for each service we just had
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester um testify that they don't in
 
04:59:07.110 --> 04:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
in uh Ruth Wards uh she was expanding
 
04:59:11.230 --> 04:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
medic Medicaid parental consent so if uh
 
04:59:14.830 --> 04:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
again these blanket forms app parent
 
04:59:18.590 --> 04:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
signs could be used as uh well we're
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
going to change something on on the
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid billing we're going to change
 
04:59:24.788 --> 04:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
services it doesn't specify that a
 
04:59:27.750 --> 04:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
parent needs to consent on each each
 
04:59:30.430 --> 04:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
service that they provide another
 
04:59:32.470 --> 04:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
example because I maybe you want
 
04:59:34.750 --> 04:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
examples maybe you don't but I did have
 
04:59:37.150 --> 04:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
a parent one day call me and say that um
 
04:59:38.910 --> 04:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner knows about this I
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
report all this to the commissioner
 
04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
um that his son was in the lunchroom and
 
04:59:46.110 --> 04:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
they were playing swords with their
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
knives with the plastic knives and his
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
son scraped the arm of his friend he
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
goes down he gets a psychological
 
04:59:56.190 --> 04:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation is that is that resulting of
 
04:59:58.430 --> 04:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
of the the language which are the point
 
05:00:00.948 --> 05:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
is that there was not parental consent
 
05:00:03.310 --> 05:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
for that psychological evaluation and
 
05:00:06.110 --> 05:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
that's a big issue in these grants is
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing these Services providing
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
Services sometimes with a blanket
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
consent so in terms of transparency yes
 
05:00:17.628 --> 05:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
I do believe this is why I think it's so
 
05:00:19.910 --> 05:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
important for Schoolboard members to
 
05:00:22.350 --> 05:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
read these grants and maybe they would
 
05:00:24.390 --> 05:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
miss something like that I don't know
 
05:00:26.470 --> 05:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
maybe it's because I I look at them and
 
05:00:28.708 --> 05:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
I see that but yes I think that is
 
05:00:32.868 --> 05:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
extremely important to um to to read
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
these grants I think it's important that
 
05:00:36.910 --> 05:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
everybody in the community you know if
 
05:00:40.030 --> 05:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
they're interested read these grants um
 
05:00:42.788 --> 05:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that and again this
 
05:00:46.270 --> 05:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
comes directly from their documentation
 
05:00:49.110 --> 05:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
that they sent me uh that they're
 
05:00:50.070 --> 05:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're they're talking about the
 
05:00:52.548 --> 05:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
Community Schools approach with better
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
with braided funding and B better data
 
05:00:56.830 --> 05:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
sharing there's there's we have
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
loopholes in data privacy sharing
 
05:01:02.548 --> 05:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
through furpa so again this is something
 
05:01:04.350 --> 05:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
that at Schoolboard members should be
 
05:01:06.270 --> 05:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
reading should be looking at making sure
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
that the data that is being shared is
 
05:01:11.990 --> 05:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
that personally that we don't have
 
05:01:13.628 --> 05:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
enough laws to cover that but if I was a
 
05:01:15.390 --> 05:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard member I would say in my
 
05:01:18.070 --> 05:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
contract no this is not acceptable
 
05:01:20.190 --> 05:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
rewrite it with more data protections
 
05:01:22.670 --> 05:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
for the students
 
05:01:25.270 --> 05:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
um they part they're partnering with
 
05:01:28.030 --> 05:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester proud to create a coordinated
 
05:01:29.708 --> 05:01:29.718 align:start position:0%
system of Community
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and the district
 
05:01:34.110 --> 05:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
established a position specifically
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated to equity within its
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
leadership structure known as a chief
 
05:01:40.190 --> 05:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
Equity officer so Within These Grant
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
there's more people being hired a lot of
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
this money is not getting to the
 
05:01:48.830 --> 05:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
students in terms of you know uh just
 
05:01:50.230 --> 05:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
helping them
 
05:01:52.590 --> 05:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
educationally um I just wanted to share
 
05:01:54.190 --> 05:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
some examples because I think that you
 
05:01:56.830 --> 05:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
need to know what's going on with these
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
grants and if a school board says yes
 
05:02:01.868 --> 05:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
we've read it we liked it so be it but I
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.190 --> 05:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
transparency sorry that's it than you
 
05:02:11.470 --> 05:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
very much are there any
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
questions rep Maguire thank you Mr
 
05:02:17.230 --> 05:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Miss Manfield
 
05:02:19.948 --> 05:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
so am I hearing you correctly that you'd
 
05:02:22.708 --> 05:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
like to have uh more notice more
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
transparency and so on not just
 
05:02:27.670 --> 05:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily for federal grants like this
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
bill is about but for all grants I would
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
yes and you're less concerned about this
 
05:02:38.030 --> 05:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
business of making federal grants
 
05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
unanticipated money and thereby possibly
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
making some difficulty for budgeting
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
purposes um in terms of how that all
 
05:02:52.190 --> 05:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
works the interconnectedness with the
 
05:02:54.670 --> 05:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
budget I wouldn't be able to speak to
 
05:02:56.510 --> 05:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
that I don't know that I'm telling you
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
that in terms of what I know about these
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
grants that the devil's in the details
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
and anybody just signing off on them I
 
05:03:05.948 --> 05:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
think you know the seabook example is is
 
05:03:08.230 --> 05:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
perfect that you know they really didn't
 
05:03:09.910 --> 05:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
know what was in it you know they kind
 
05:03:11.110 --> 05:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
of signed it and didn't know it was in
 
05:03:12.628 --> 05:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
it until it was too late and then they
 
05:03:15.510 --> 05:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
said we don't want the grant anymore um
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
had they been required to and of course
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
now they are because it's in their
 
05:03:23.110 --> 05:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
policy um you know the devil's in the
 
05:03:25.030 --> 05:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
details thank you are there further
 
05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent
 
05:03:30.628 --> 05:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
Earth thank you Mr speaker thank you for
 
05:03:35.150 --> 05:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
my question should this bill be enhanced
 
05:03:37.470 --> 05:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
to make specific reference to to the
 
05:03:39.230 --> 05:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent's responsibility to do
 
05:03:42.070 --> 05:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
this as well to to the responsibility to
 
05:03:44.910 --> 05:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
inform the boards of what the boards are
 
05:03:48.670 --> 05:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
being required to report here um
 
05:03:50.708 --> 05:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
technically I don't know that that
 
05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
answer I would say somebody within the
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
administration either maybe they have a
 
05:03:57.628 --> 05:03:57.638 align:start position:0%
grant person within the school that's
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
that's doing that job somebody needs to
 
05:04:02.350 --> 05:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
make this the school board aware
 
05:04:03.750 --> 05:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to provide this
 
05:04:05.708 --> 05:04:05.718 align:start position:0%
documentation to I can get it through a
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
91a anybody can get it um but the school
 
05:04:10.830 --> 05:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
board should review them them before
 
05:04:13.548 --> 05:04:13.558 align:start position:0%
accepting the money
 
05:04:16.510 --> 05:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely further questions yes
 
05:04:19.110 --> 05:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
represent Damon thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:04:21.070 --> 05:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
you for my taking my question in the
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
interest of transparency would you
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
please follow up with the committee with
 
05:04:28.548 --> 05:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
the contact info and the specifics of
 
05:04:30.750 --> 05:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
the grant situations that you referenced
 
05:04:32.990 --> 05:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about specifically including
 
05:04:36.030 --> 05:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
the main one um so that we can follow up
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
and do our due diligence oh so you would
 
05:04:43.948 --> 05:04:43.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:46.628 --> 05:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
um all of the examples you cited because
 
05:04:50.590 --> 05:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
they are I'm hearing them as anecdotal
 
05:04:53.548 --> 05:04:53.558 align:start position:0%
examples I I can do that for Maine the
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
dad that contacted me I would have to
 
05:04:57.510 --> 05:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
keep that information confidential I did
 
05:04:58.708 --> 05:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
share it with the commissioner you're
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
more than welcome to speak to him he
 
05:05:03.150 --> 05:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
knows I gave him the information um but
 
05:05:05.030 --> 05:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to specific people who
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
contact me a lot of times I keep that uh
 
05:05:09.948 --> 05:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
information confidential but I'm but in
 
05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of Maine that that's already
 
05:05:14.430 --> 05:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
publicized I'm happy to do that um
 
05:05:17.070 --> 05:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
trying to think what else I brought up
 
05:05:19.030 --> 05:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
is there anything else
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
Maine I mean Maine you can Google that
 
05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
one um representative Heidi Samson who
 
05:05:26.628 --> 05:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
served in Maine is well aware of what
 
05:05:28.510 --> 05:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
went down with all of that she's no
 
05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
longer serving in the legislature but
 
05:05:32.990 --> 05:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
she was one of the people that um
 
05:05:35.868 --> 05:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
specifically told me the
 
05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
details further further
 
05:05:42.070 --> 05:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
questions n see thank you very much and
 
05:05:46.590 --> 05:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
that concludes the testimony for that
 
05:05:49.868 --> 05:05:49.878 align:start position:0%
bill we have one bill left that's uh 716
 
05:05:51.670 --> 05:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
making an appropriation for the Dual and
 
05:05:53.390 --> 05:05:53.400 align:start position:0%

05:06:45.548 --> 05:06:45.558 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm here today to
 
05:06:48.628 --> 05:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
introduce Bill HB 716 my name is Rick
 
05:06:51.390 --> 05:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
lad I come from hail New Hampshire uh
 
05:06:53.628 --> 05:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is relative to the concurrent
 
05:06:56.910 --> 05:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment program and which we have
 
05:06:58.270 --> 05:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
through the community the Dual and
 
05:06:59.708 --> 05:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment program which we
 
05:07:03.230 --> 05:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
have through the university uh Community
 
05:07:05.628 --> 05:07:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh uh community college system which
 
05:07:07.628 --> 05:07:07.638 align:start position:0%
works with our schools and in the past
 
05:07:11.070 --> 05:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
we've uh allocated this uh sum of a $2.5
 
05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
million this is asking for $3 million we
 
05:07:18.430 --> 05:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
have since uh we initiated this program
 
05:07:20.910 --> 05:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh where we once had grades 11 and 12
 
05:07:23.110 --> 05:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
students eligible we have grades 10 11
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
and 12 right now so that does result in
 
05:07:29.708 --> 05:07:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh additional costs we also know that by
 
05:07:31.788 --> 05:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
putting forward this program where the
 
05:07:34.548 --> 05:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
uh students in the high school and in
 
05:07:36.470 --> 05:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
the dual enrollment program taught at
 
05:07:39.868 --> 05:07:39.878 align:start position:0%
the Collegiate level um the the it can
 
05:07:42.830 --> 05:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
take these courses for $150 we we talked
 
05:07:45.310 --> 05:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
about that per course and that could be
 
05:07:47.670 --> 05:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
a net Savings of later on when that
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
would student would had it done it as a
 
05:07:53.110 --> 05:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
as a an older student out of high school
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
a cost for all of them to do this the
 
05:07:57.788 --> 05:07:57.798 align:start position:0%
aggregate would be over I believe over
 
05:08:00.868 --> 05:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
$10 million that's a huge saving so it's
 
05:08:03.270 --> 05:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
putting forth the dollar now uh to
 
05:08:05.190 --> 05:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
enrich the program to allow us to
 
05:08:07.030 --> 05:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
facilitate what we have designed that
 
05:08:09.788 --> 05:08:09.798 align:start position:0%
program for and it would be an increase
 
05:08:13.350 --> 05:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
the budget which we see in hb1 supported
 
05:08:17.310 --> 05:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
by hb2 by $500,000 a
 
05:08:20.510 --> 05:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
year that concludes my testimony a model
 
05:08:26.670 --> 05:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:29.510 --> 05:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
05:08:31.708 --> 05:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
as I understand this program this is a
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
high school student taking a class or
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
two at community college and um
 
05:08:45.788 --> 05:08:45.798 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the cost of that be borne by
 
05:08:48.868 --> 05:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
the school district since they no longer
 
05:08:50.830 --> 05:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
have the obligation for teaching that
 
05:08:53.548 --> 05:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
student during that period of time the
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
student at the same time is getting
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
credit for graduating from high school
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
so it's concurrent you get dual and
 
05:09:04.150 --> 05:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
credit as a college course and for that
 
05:09:08.110 --> 05:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
High School course um and it has to be
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
taught in conjunction with the
 
05:09:14.270 --> 05:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
particular standards that the the univer
 
05:09:16.350 --> 05:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
community college system has been
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
authorized by their accrediting board
 
05:09:21.270 --> 05:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
which are you have to have in this state
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
the Masters and you also have to have
 
05:09:27.230 --> 05:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
the the uh same course materials and the
 
05:09:29.788 --> 05:09:29.798 align:start position:0%
the same curriculum that is used for
 
05:09:32.350 --> 05:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
that course at the college campus so
 
05:09:34.150 --> 05:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
that would have to be done at the
 
05:09:36.270 --> 05:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
community college at the high school
 
05:09:41.150 --> 05:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative papovich and then Fells
 
05:09:45.310 --> 05:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
representative for
 
05:09:46.878 --> 05:09:48.390 align:start position:0%
representative for
testifying

05:09:48.390 --> 05:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
05:09:52.390 --> 05:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
um does participating in this program
 
05:09:54.628 --> 05:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
require any additional expenses for the
 
05:09:54.638 --> 05:09:56.110 align:start position:0%
require any additional expenses for the
school

05:09:56.110 --> 05:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
districts for the school districts
 
05:10:00.430 --> 05:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
correct for the school districts we know
 
05:10:02.190 --> 05:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
the college is doing some work if in
 
05:10:03.788 --> 05:10:03.798 align:start position:0%
fact you have an instructor that's
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
already there that's capable of doing
 
05:10:07.350 --> 05:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
this that has the Masters let's say in
 
05:10:08.990 --> 05:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
the mathematics that's part of their
 
05:10:10.868 --> 05:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
contract contract so they're doing at no
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
cost to the school district however
 
05:10:16.990 --> 05:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
there is a cost of $150 for that cost
 
05:10:19.788 --> 05:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
through the community college system but
 
05:10:22.110 --> 05:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
there should be no additional cost to
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
the uh unless for example you do not
 
05:10:29.868 --> 05:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
have the instructor at your school that
 
05:10:32.190 --> 05:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
has the math and they bring that
 
05:10:33.708 --> 05:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
instructor down from the community
 
05:10:35.868 --> 05:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
college system then there there could be
 
05:10:38.548 --> 05:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
an expense to the to pay from the school
 
05:10:42.030 --> 05:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
district to pay that person to do
 
05:10:45.110 --> 05:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
that representative fellas yeah just a
 
05:10:47.990 --> 05:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
followup to that question so so the
 
05:10:49.708 --> 05:10:49.718 align:start position:0%
money the
 
05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
$3,000 3 million three million
 
05:10:58.350 --> 05:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
sorry um most of it is probably going to
 
05:10:58.360 --> 05:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
sorry um most of it is probably going to
the

05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:11:03.548 --> 05:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
$150 per student but but some of it
 
05:11:08.670 --> 05:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
might go to pay an a a community college
 
05:11:08.680 --> 05:11:09.910 align:start position:0%
might go to pay an a a community college
instructor

05:11:09.910 --> 05:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
instructor
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
to we have the we have the chancellor
 
05:11:14.150 --> 05:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
here along with the community college
 
05:11:14.160 --> 05:11:16.390 align:start position:0%
here along with the community college
system

05:11:16.390 --> 05:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:11:19.470 --> 05:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
and the money that I see in this bill is
 
05:11:23.390 --> 05:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
for the $150 to pay for that course that
 
05:11:25.510 --> 05:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
allows us to have that Savings of 10
 
05:11:28.230 --> 05:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
plus million dollar in the long run uh
 
05:11:29.990 --> 05:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
if if they hadn't taken those courses
 
05:11:32.510 --> 05:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
there that's what it would cost us as
 
05:11:37.708 --> 05:11:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:40.470 --> 05:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
courses okay see no further questions
 
05:11:43.310 --> 05:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll get my pink card
 
05:11:49.470 --> 05:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.230 --> 05:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
good come up CH jointly
 
05:11:55.788 --> 05:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
okay and we don't have any other P cards
 
05:11:58.750 --> 05:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
right here okay uh good I'm going to
 
05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
call jointly uh Chancellor Mark
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:18.548 --> 05:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
system thank you very much I'm here to
 
05:12:20.990 --> 05:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of this bill if I may
 
05:12:23.270 --> 05:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
begin with a point of
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
clarification uh to represent Maguire's
 
05:12:27.670 --> 05:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
question there are actually three
 
05:12:30.590 --> 05:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
different formats for Early College one
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
is in the high schools and typically
 
05:12:35.390 --> 05:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
taught by the high school teacher who's
 
05:12:37.548 --> 05:12:37.558 align:start position:0%
academically qualified to deliver our
 
05:12:40.150 --> 05:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum that proba accounts for about
 
05:12:43.230 --> 05:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
90% of the activity but the other two
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
versions include on our campuses with
 
05:12:49.150 --> 05:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
our faculty and online and those account
 
05:12:51.430 --> 05:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
between them for another 10% of the
 
05:12:54.150 --> 05:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
activity so some of this is borne by the
 
05:12:56.830 --> 05:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
school district through the compensation
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
of teachers some by our folks up until
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
the current bium the language in statute
 
05:13:05.470 --> 05:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
for this was specifically to fund
 
05:13:07.590 --> 05:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
scholarships for courses and originally
 
05:13:10.390 --> 05:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
CTE and stem cour is eventually
 
05:13:13.070 --> 05:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
broadened and from our bant Point
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps most helpfully giving us some
 
05:13:18.270 --> 05:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
latitude to support the program when we
 
05:13:20.350 --> 05:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
do have an instance where a school
 
05:13:22.708 --> 05:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
district may not have a teachers able to
 
05:13:24.590 --> 05:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
offer part of the curriculum for us to
 
05:13:27.948 --> 05:13:27.958 align:start position:0%
be able to step in uh with our with our
 
05:13:29.990 --> 05:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
instructors to support
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
that as representative lad described in
 
05:13:37.150 --> 05:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
the last year uh we had over 10,000
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
students participate in Early College
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
across that group of students they
 
05:13:46.350 --> 05:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
earned about 54,000 credits at our
 
05:13:48.310 --> 05:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
tuition rate that would have been about
 
05:13:52.190 --> 05:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
$13 million so the $2.5 million that
 
05:13:54.270 --> 05:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
supported that had a return on
 
05:13:57.230 --> 05:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
investment that is the 10 million that
 
05:14:00.030 --> 05:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative lad is describing last
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
year we saw 15% growth year-over-year
 
05:14:07.230 --> 05:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
the current year uh spring is not yet
 
05:14:09.150 --> 05:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
completed but we're probably looking at
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
about 10% year-over-year continued
 
05:14:13.628 --> 05:14:13.638 align:start position:0%
growth we'll probably approach 60,000
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
credits delivered again for the same
 
05:14:18.548 --> 05:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
$2.5 million this year as last year so
 
05:14:21.270 --> 05:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
the return on investment growing that
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
return on investment that we calculate
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
is based on our tuition $215 of credit
 
05:14:29.948 --> 05:14:29.958 align:start position:0%
and $25 enrollment fee if that student
 
05:14:31.830 --> 05:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
is enrolling at the University system
 
05:14:34.070 --> 05:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
where tuition rates are essentially
 
05:14:36.910 --> 05:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
twice that you can you can in some
 
05:14:38.350 --> 05:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
double the savings if you're looking at
 
05:14:41.310 --> 05:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
a private institution uh significantly
 
05:14:43.510 --> 05:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
more so we've used the most conservative
 
05:14:45.430 --> 05:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
way of describing what we think is the
 
05:14:48.070 --> 05:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
return on investment for the states
 
05:14:51.390 --> 05:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
funds not coming to ccsnh but return on
 
05:14:53.230 --> 05:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
investment in terms of value to students
 
05:14:55.470 --> 05:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
and families a point that was made
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
earlier typically students are taking
 
05:14:59.788 --> 05:14:59.798 align:start position:0%
just one or two courses and what we've
 
05:15:02.030 --> 05:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
been working on to try and grow this is
 
05:15:05.590 --> 05:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
help students actually take sets of
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
courses for a student who's going on to
 
05:15:11.070 --> 05:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
college to take one or two courses may
 
05:15:12.788 --> 05:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
make a semester a little bit lighter
 
05:15:14.910 --> 05:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
give them a little bit more flexibility
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
but where the real impact shows up is
 
05:15:18.390 --> 05:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
when a student can complete a full
 
05:15:20.230 --> 05:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
semester's worth of college or a full
 
05:15:22.470 --> 05:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
year or even the associate degree while
 
05:15:24.670 --> 05:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
still in high school because that year
 
05:15:26.708 --> 05:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
or two of savings that they're not
 
05:15:28.510 --> 05:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
paying for college that they're not
 
05:15:30.990 --> 05:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
taking out loans and a year or two more
 
05:15:33.548 --> 05:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
rapidly into the workforce is just
 
05:15:35.548 --> 05:15:35.558 align:start position:0%
significantly more beneficial for them
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
and frankly for New Hampshire's
 
05:15:39.830 --> 05:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce so the object jective that we
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
have is to offer students enough
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take courses that they
 
05:15:46.030 --> 05:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
can actually complete that meaningful
 
05:15:48.430 --> 05:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
block whether it's again a semester or a
 
05:15:51.190 --> 05:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
year or more before they actually find
 
05:15:54.430 --> 05:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
themselves graduated from high school
 
05:15:55.990 --> 05:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I would want you to
 
05:15:59.910 --> 05:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
know about this effort about 30% of the
 
05:16:02.230 --> 05:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
credits earned by students in Early
 
05:16:04.510 --> 05:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
College last year or students who were
 
05:16:07.110 --> 05:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Career Technical Education
 
05:16:10.230 --> 05:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
Centers now in our high schools those
 
05:16:12.590 --> 05:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
students represent about 10 or 12% of
 
05:16:14.270 --> 05:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
the enrollment but they're over
 
05:16:17.150 --> 05:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
represented in participation we think
 
05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
that this is starting to reach those
 
05:16:20.830 --> 05:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
students for whom opportunity may have
 
05:16:23.990 --> 05:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
been uh more more distant and it's in a
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
range of Fields Automotive students who
 
05:16:28.868 --> 05:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
are interested in welding students who
 
05:16:30.670 --> 05:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
are interested in health care virtually
 
05:16:33.628 --> 05:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
any field that we offer students can get
 
05:16:33.638 --> 05:16:34.390 align:start position:0%
any field that we offer students can get
the

05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:16:37.070 --> 05:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
foundation started earlier and more
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
affordably gives them more options
 
05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
as they progress so we we think that
 
05:16:44.430 --> 05:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
there's real value to the state in this
 
05:16:47.030 --> 05:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
program we've seen students and families
 
05:16:50.628 --> 05:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
embrace it uh we think that it it it's
 
05:16:52.910 --> 05:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
worthwhile for the state to continue to
 
05:16:54.750 --> 05:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
support this effort and I'm happy to
 
05:16:56.868 --> 05:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have I'm
 
05:16:59.548 --> 05:16:59.558 align:start position:0%
also joined by my colleague Shauna young
 
05:17:02.190 --> 05:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
director of secondary Pathways who can
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
answer the more detailed
 
05:17:07.590 --> 05:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
questions very good thank you yes
 
05:17:09.470 --> 05:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative mire thank you Mr
 
05:17:10.590 --> 05:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:17:13.110 --> 05:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
question so what fraction of high
 
05:17:15.110 --> 05:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
schools participate in this program and
 
05:17:19.070 --> 05:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
does VX participate VX does for the
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
online portion of this and we serve I
 
05:17:24.310 --> 05:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
want to say it's at least a 100 high
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
schools across the state virtually every
 
05:17:33.270 --> 05:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:35.948 --> 05:17:35.958 align:start position:0%
this yes representative B thank you
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for um the question the the
 
05:17:40.830 --> 05:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
the advantage to the program correct me
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong is that these courses
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
articulate with University and college
 
05:17:48.750 --> 05:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
courses not just the community college
 
05:17:51.868 --> 05:17:51.878 align:start position:0%
system and does it not give the parents
 
05:17:54.548 --> 05:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
assurance that their their son or
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
daughter will get a leg up on that
 
05:17:58.708 --> 05:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
education that they won't have to pay
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
for at the next
 
05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
level comp completely correct a student
 
05:18:03.280 --> 05:18:04.110 align:start position:0%
level comp completely correct a student
who

05:18:04.110 --> 05:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:18:07.708 --> 05:18:07.718 align:start position:0%
earns credits on through Early College
 
05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
receives a transcript from from ccsnh if
 
05:18:12.750 --> 05:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
they happen to be at Oyster River High
 
05:18:14.670 --> 05:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
School the transcript is from Great Bay
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
Community College if they happen to be
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
here in conquer it may be from
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
nhti it is a ccsnh course a ccsnh
 
05:18:26.590 --> 05:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
transcript and the credits apply and as
 
05:18:28.670 --> 05:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
you probably know over the last several
 
05:18:29.868 --> 05:18:29.878 align:start position:0%
years as we've worked with the
 
05:18:31.868 --> 05:18:31.878 align:start position:0%
university system to build Pathways
 
05:18:34.110 --> 05:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
between the two programs students not
 
05:18:35.948 --> 05:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
only have more assurance that these
 
05:18:38.030 --> 05:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
credits transfer and apply to those
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
degrees but actually can map out what
 
05:18:42.990 --> 05:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
the degree path should look like so no
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
wasted time money no lost credits and in
 
05:18:49.628 --> 05:18:49.638 align:start position:0%
the long term as this state has tended
 
05:18:52.110 --> 05:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
to see majority of its students who are
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to fouryear colleges go out of
 
05:18:56.350 --> 05:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
state to do that we think that we can
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
use these Pathways to help New Hampshire
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
students find opportunities in New
 
05:19:04.548 --> 05:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire schools to stay here thank you
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you represent represent fellows
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um is there a cost to the you
 
05:19:12.430 --> 05:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
to the community college system to get
 
05:19:15.070 --> 05:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
these teachers certified to to be able
 
05:19:17.910 --> 05:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
to teach these courses well T typically
 
05:19:19.590 --> 05:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
we're working with high schools and
 
05:19:22.670 --> 05:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
identifying teachers who are already
 
05:19:24.830 --> 05:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
academically qualified have the required
 
05:19:26.590 --> 05:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
master's degree in the discipline that
 
05:19:30.350 --> 05:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
they'll be teaching we invest in we have
 
05:19:32.910 --> 05:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
Early College coordinators working with
 
05:19:35.070 --> 05:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
schools throughout the state each of our
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
colleges has a a person whose role is to
 
05:19:41.070 --> 05:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
work with colleges work with guidance
 
05:19:42.948 --> 05:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
councils work with teachers recruit
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
students to help with the registration
 
05:19:48.628 --> 05:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
process so we we're not actively working
 
05:19:51.628 --> 05:19:51.638 align:start position:0%
to prepare teachers to be certified but
 
05:19:53.310 --> 05:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
we are working with school districts to
 
05:19:54.390 --> 05:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
help them understand what the
 
05:19:56.230 --> 05:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
opportunties are and in places where a
 
05:19:58.150 --> 05:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
district may not have somebody again
 
05:19:59.788 --> 05:19:59.798 align:start position:0%
pointing back to the opportunities we
 
05:20:02.110 --> 05:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
can offer on our
 
05:20:05.788 --> 05:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
campuses you're welcome yes
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative Miller
 
05:20:11.110 --> 05:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it any short form of it
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
works for me um and thank you for coming
 
05:20:16.470 --> 05:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
and testifying and answering questions I
 
05:20:17.948 --> 05:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
think it would be useful to all of us
 
05:20:21.270 --> 05:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
and me in particular if maybe either you
 
05:20:23.350 --> 05:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
or your colleague would go into detail
 
05:20:25.708 --> 05:20:25.718 align:start position:0%
and explain exactly what the funds are
 
05:20:27.390 --> 05:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
going to be what what are they getting
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
spent on you know you receive this
 
05:20:31.788 --> 05:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
Revenue what are your costs what do you
 
05:20:34.590 --> 05:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
do with the money exactly so you know we
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
can better understand how the process
 
05:20:39.628 --> 05:20:39.638 align:start position:0%
works okay so some of of this is
 
05:20:43.110 --> 05:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
specifically invested in the staff who
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
provide that Outreach to the colleg uh
 
05:20:48.510 --> 05:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
to the colleges to the high schools but
 
05:20:52.750 --> 05:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
some of it is also in anticipation of
 
05:20:54.470 --> 05:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we're
 
05:20:58.750 --> 05:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
relinquishing um the about one in five
 
05:21:00.910 --> 05:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
credits that we offer about 20% are in
 
05:21:03.030 --> 05:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
math courses and to be able to offer
 
05:21:04.990 --> 05:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
math courses those tend to be larger
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
enrolled courses tend to be if if we
 
05:21:09.590 --> 05:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
were think about this purely in business
 
05:21:12.830 --> 05:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
terms those are are Revenue
 
05:21:16.030 --> 05:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
positive helps us to offset the cost of
 
05:21:20.430 --> 05:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
things that are not as as uh financially
 
05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
feasible on their own our nursing
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
programs Alli dental health programs
 
05:21:27.948 --> 05:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
that are smaller course required by
 
05:21:30.510 --> 05:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
accreditation in some ways this goes to
 
05:21:34.910 --> 05:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:37.868 --> 05:21:37.878 align:start position:0%
expenses thank you very much I I would
 
05:21:40.990 --> 05:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
concur with the request for a rough
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
breakout of how the 3 million would be
 
05:21:45.990 --> 05:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
expended if you could do that in the
 
05:21:50.190 --> 05:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
categories I I I if I go through the
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
current Staffing that we have the costs
 
05:21:56.190 --> 05:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
associated with recruitment Outreach
 
05:21:58.390 --> 05:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
administering the program as it is about
 
05:22:00.948 --> 05:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
a million and a half is offset by those
 
05:22:03.948 --> 05:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
operating expenses some of this would
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
also be used and again with the broader
 
05:22:07.948 --> 05:22:07.958 align:start position:0%
language that allows us to support
 
05:22:10.270 --> 05:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
programs we'd be looking to create
 
05:22:11.788 --> 05:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities for students who are
 
05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
participa in these courses to come to
 
05:22:16.110 --> 05:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
our campuses because part of this is
 
05:22:17.628 --> 05:22:17.638 align:start position:0%
helping them understand what the
 
05:22:19.590 --> 05:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities are to meet our faculty
 
05:22:21.670 --> 05:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
see our facilities increase the
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
likelihood that they'll persist Beyond
 
05:22:26.110 --> 05:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
High School into these programs both
 
05:22:28.350 --> 05:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
with us and with the university system
 
05:22:30.788 --> 05:22:30.798 align:start position:0%
and then some portion I can't tell you
 
05:22:33.110 --> 05:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh exactly what it is if if it's the $3
 
05:22:35.788 --> 05:22:35.798 align:start position:0%
million some portion of that would flow
 
05:22:37.708 --> 05:22:37.718 align:start position:0%
to the bottom line to offset those
 
05:22:39.750 --> 05:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
expenses that associated with courses
 
05:22:41.708 --> 05:22:41.718 align:start position:0%
that are more costly to
 
05:22:44.070 --> 05:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
deliver as I said earlier with with a
 
05:22:46.350 --> 05:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
math class because we can have larger
 
05:22:50.310 --> 05:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
enrollment that Course May cost us
 
05:22:52.948 --> 05:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
$120 per credit to deliver because we
 
05:22:55.708 --> 05:22:55.718 align:start position:0%
spread that across a two dozen students
 
05:22:57.750 --> 05:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
our nursing classes typically are
 
05:23:01.150 --> 05:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
costing us between $650 and $700 a
 
05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
credit some of our Automotive
 
05:23:06.670 --> 05:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
classes Advanced manufacturing classes
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
may be $3 and $400 per credit to deliver
 
05:23:12.548 --> 05:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
so some of this as you wash through the
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
full spectrum of our curriculum there
 
05:23:17.910 --> 05:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
are always courses that are Revenue
 
05:23:19.548 --> 05:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
positive and courses that are very
 
05:23:21.390 --> 05:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
costly to deliver and and some of this
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
is just figuring out how to make sure
 
05:23:25.868 --> 05:23:25.878 align:start position:0%
that we can provide the full spectrum of
 
05:23:28.150 --> 05:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
Education that the state needs for the
 
05:23:30.628 --> 05:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
workforce that the state
 
05:23:34.910 --> 05:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
wants okay very good yes do you know if
 
05:23:37.948 --> 05:23:37.958 align:start position:0%
you have any um homeschoolers that are
 
05:23:39.590 --> 05:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
taking that's coming back to the high
 
05:23:41.030 --> 05:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
school and the other thing is do you
 
05:23:42.990 --> 05:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
offer anything comparable at private
 
05:23:44.868 --> 05:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
schools like
 
05:23:48.430 --> 05:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
this sure yes on both occasions so the
 
05:23:50.190 --> 05:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
early college program is yes could you
 
05:23:52.070 --> 05:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
please step forward and use the mic and
 
05:23:53.390 --> 05:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
pull the mic towards you why don't you
 
05:23:54.990 --> 05:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
just take a seat for a moment all right
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
sorry than you um no the early college
 
05:23:59.110 --> 05:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
program is open to both homeschool
 
05:24:00.510 --> 05:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
students Traditional High School
 
05:24:03.230 --> 05:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
students as well as private high schools
 
05:24:04.670 --> 05:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
um for the private high schools they
 
05:24:07.510 --> 05:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
will need to have an or an memor
 
05:24:10.230 --> 05:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding with us um
 
05:24:12.868 --> 05:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
but the program is offered to a vast
 
05:24:18.110 --> 05:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:21.310 --> 05:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
families yes representative Damon thank
 
05:24:24.830 --> 05:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
you could one of you speak to what
 
05:24:28.110 --> 05:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
portion of students who do one or more
 
05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
dual income enrollment courses continue
 
05:24:33.470 --> 05:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
in higher ed whether with the community
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
college system or otherwise and also
 
05:24:40.670 --> 05:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
what portion of of those students um are
 
05:24:43.750 --> 05:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents so V virtually
 
05:24:45.110 --> 05:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
all of them in New Hampshire high
 
05:24:47.070 --> 05:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
schools are New Hampshire residents
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
there are some folks on the on the edges
 
05:24:52.430 --> 05:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
of Vermont and Maine that we we see but
 
05:24:56.030 --> 05:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
I put it at 98% New Hampshire to your
 
05:24:57.628 --> 05:24:57.638 align:start position:0%
question we actually have very good data
 
05:25:00.590 --> 05:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
we we looked at the period from 2015 to
 
05:25:03.310 --> 05:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
2022 in part just to be able to see what
 
05:25:05.390 --> 05:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
happens to students after so students
 
05:25:08.310 --> 05:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
who participated in Early College dur
 
05:25:09.788 --> 05:25:09.798 align:start position:0%
during that period of time we served
 
05:25:13.030 --> 05:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
about 35,000 students what we found is
 
05:25:16.590 --> 05:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
about 80% of them go on to postsecondary
 
05:25:20.910 --> 05:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
education about 6,000 of those 35,000
 
05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
ended up at some point at the community
 
05:25:22.920 --> 05:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
ended up at some point at the community
college

05:25:23.990 --> 05:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
college
 
05:25:27.430 --> 05:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
system about 6600 ended up at the
 
05:25:30.150 --> 05:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
University system we know that the
 
05:25:31.990 --> 05:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
majority of students who participate in
 
05:25:34.548 --> 05:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
early college at least in that period of
 
05:25:36.990 --> 05:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
time ended up going to four-year
 
05:25:39.270 --> 05:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
Institutions and those students the
 
05:25:42.470 --> 05:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
majority actually went out of state so
 
05:25:44.110 --> 05:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've seen in the
 
05:25:45.990 --> 05:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
last couple of years is a growth in
 
05:25:48.110 --> 05:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
participation of students in our Career
 
05:25:50.708 --> 05:25:50.718 align:start position:0%
Technical Education Centers whose
 
05:25:52.750 --> 05:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
interests we think are better aligned
 
05:25:54.708 --> 05:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
with many of the technical programs we
 
05:25:57.788 --> 05:25:57.798 align:start position:0%
have we expect that as those data become
 
05:26:00.310 --> 05:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
more current more recent years where
 
05:26:01.510 --> 05:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen that growth we're going to
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
see more of those students coming to the
 
05:26:05.070 --> 05:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
community college system and more of the
 
05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
students staying in New Hampshire even
 
05:26:10.350 --> 05:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
for the students who are bound heading
 
05:26:12.868 --> 05:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
toward four-year institutions we think
 
05:26:14.830 --> 05:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
that growing concerns about
 
05:26:17.110 --> 05:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
affordability plus the opportunity for
 
05:26:18.868 --> 05:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
them to be better engaged to these
 
05:26:21.708 --> 05:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
programs can bring more of those
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
students to New Hampshire schools rather
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
than having them go out of state with
 
05:26:28.948 --> 05:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:33.190 --> 05:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
earning and one last data piece do you
 
05:26:36.868 --> 05:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
have any knowledge to share
 
05:26:39.708 --> 05:26:39.718 align:start position:0%
on how many many of the Dual and
 
05:26:41.628 --> 05:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment students are
 
05:26:44.350 --> 05:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
students who would not likely have gone
 
05:26:45.948 --> 05:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
to college if this program wasn't
 
05:26:47.990 --> 05:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
brought to them in high school or made
 
05:26:50.990 --> 05:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
available to them in high school so this
 
05:26:52.948 --> 05:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
is another one of those questions where
 
05:26:55.750 --> 05:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
we think the more recent data will be
 
05:26:58.350 --> 05:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
different than the historic data when
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
this program was first created and this
 
05:27:03.150 --> 05:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
kind of early college program exists
 
05:27:05.070 --> 05:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
around the country the original intent
 
05:27:07.708 --> 05:27:07.718 align:start position:0%
was to give students the opportunity to
 
05:27:09.868 --> 05:27:09.878 align:start position:0%
test themselves to demonstrate for
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
themselves that they could be successful
 
05:27:14.150 --> 05:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
with college level learning what's
 
05:27:15.948 --> 05:27:15.958 align:start position:0%
happened for the most part is that
 
05:27:17.310 --> 05:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
students who already knew they were
 
05:27:20.190 --> 05:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
headed to college and their parents
 
05:27:22.830 --> 05:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
financially Savvy said let's let's get
 
05:27:26.270 --> 05:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
some of this covered early and so the I
 
05:27:27.990 --> 05:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
think the early years what we've seen is
 
05:27:30.150 --> 05:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
a disproportionate share of students who
 
05:27:32.150 --> 05:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
would either take an AP course or an
 
05:27:34.830 --> 05:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
honors course or an early college course
 
05:27:37.030 --> 05:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
as we begun to reach more students
 
05:27:39.070 --> 05:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
through the CTE I think we're starting
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
to see that student for whom College
 
05:27:43.868 --> 05:27:43.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't always a certainty and and
 
05:27:45.788 --> 05:27:45.798 align:start position:0%
particularly as I I described earlier on
 
05:27:48.628 --> 05:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of the technical programs when I
 
05:27:50.628 --> 05:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
was in high school you were either in a
 
05:27:52.628 --> 05:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
college prep curriculum or Vocational
 
05:27:55.390 --> 05:27:55.400 align:start position:0%
Technical curriculum those are starting
 
05:27:57.750 --> 05:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
to blend more and there there's almost
 
05:27:59.868 --> 05:27:59.878 align:start position:0%
no field of technology or the trades
 
05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require some level of
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
advanced education and if we can help
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
students regardless of what it is they
 
05:28:08.590 --> 05:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
want to study get the foundation that
 
05:28:10.708 --> 05:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
they need it's going to help them so
 
05:28:12.910 --> 05:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see through the growth
 
05:28:16.030 --> 05:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
in enrollment among CTE Center students
 
05:28:17.990 --> 05:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
I think more of that broadening of the
 
05:28:20.110 --> 05:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
pipeline bringing more students to the
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities that will be helpful for
 
05:28:25.070 --> 05:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
them you're
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
welcome very good okay yes
 
05:28:29.868 --> 05:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
representative mire thank you Mr
 
05:28:33.190 --> 05:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you have any um school
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
districts or students who want to
 
05:28:38.350 --> 05:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
participate in the program been turned
 
05:28:40.470 --> 05:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
away due to lack of
 
05:28:44.110 --> 05:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
funds not in the period of time
 
05:28:46.990 --> 05:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
that we've I've been hearing that we've
 
05:28:49.110 --> 05:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
had this funding what we do currently
 
05:28:50.910 --> 05:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
have though is a limitation of two
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
courses per student so there are
 
05:28:55.628 --> 05:28:55.638 align:start position:0%
students for whom taking that third
 
05:28:57.910 --> 05:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
course becomes an issue of whether the
 
05:29:00.628 --> 05:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
family has the additional funds and
 
05:29:02.150 --> 05:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
there may be students who when they've
 
05:29:05.670 --> 05:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
exhausted the $150 scholarship and again
 
05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's a $150 for course that if they
 
05:29:11.548 --> 05:29:11.558 align:start position:0%
came to us tuition and fees would be a
 
05:29:13.350 --> 05:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
for if it's a four credit course would
 
05:29:15.070 --> 05:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
be essentially a
 
05:29:17.868 --> 05:29:17.878 align:start position:0%
$960 value there may be students who
 
05:29:20.190 --> 05:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
have have been dissuaded by the need to
 
05:29:24.190 --> 05:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
find the 150 follow up could such
 
05:29:26.670 --> 05:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
students pay with their own private
 
05:29:30.270 --> 05:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
funds and take more classes and students
 
05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
can and and I'm sure have thank you
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome sir so that seems to be
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
the context of the scholarship
 
05:29:36.840 --> 05:29:39.030 align:start position:0%
the context of the scholarship
characterization

05:29:39.030 --> 05:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
characterization
 
05:29:40.590 --> 05:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
good any other
 
05:29:43.030 --> 05:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
questions very good thank you for your
 
05:29:47.670 --> 05:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm going to close the
 
05:29:51.270 --> 05:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh that's our our last I
 
05:29:53.070 --> 05:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anybody else signed
 
05:29:55.110 --> 05:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
up to speak that's our last bill but if
 
05:29:57.190 --> 05:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
everyone would sit tight till our chair
 
05:30:00.030 --> 05:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
has a chance to retake his seat I'll let
 
05:30:32.230 --> 05:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:34.470 --> 05:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
well Chancellor Rubenstein and the folks
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
you brought thank you very very much uh
 
05:30:38.948 --> 05:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh the community college system is
 
05:30:41.708 --> 05:30:41.718 align:start position:0%
really I feel Rick lad speaking done an
 
05:30:46.230 --> 05:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
awful lot to blend uh what you do with
 
05:30:47.910 --> 05:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
the Career Technical Education Centers
 
05:30:49.628 --> 05:30:49.638 align:start position:0%
and with our high schools so it's not
 
05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
just K through 12 now you're you're
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
working collaboratively and it's
 
05:30:55.708 --> 05:30:55.718 align:start position:0%
probably going to save us a great deal
 
05:30:58.030 --> 05:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
of money even with our CTE centers if we
 
05:30:59.830 --> 05:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
can get those students that are involved
 
05:31:02.310 --> 05:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
in this program engaged in some of that
 
05:31:04.190 --> 05:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
program may be done down at uh
