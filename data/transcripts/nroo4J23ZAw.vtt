03:42:10.030 --> 03:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
have that application at a state level
 

03:42:10.040 --> 03:42:12.630 align:start position:0%

03:42:25.389 --> 03:42:25.399 align:start position:0%
um so we we don't currently have the
 

03:42:25.399 --> 03:42:28.070 align:start position:0%

so it's indeterminable for us to to know
 

03:42:34.159 --> 03:42:36.550 align:start position:0%
so it's indeterminable for us to to know

03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
how much that cost would be some might
 

03:42:36.560 --> 03:42:39.309 align:start position:0%

use<03:42:39.760><c> another</c><03:42:40.199><c> platform</c><03:42:40.600><c> so</c><03:42:40.800><c> there's</c>

03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
use another platform so there's
 

03:42:41.040 --> 03:42:42.550 align:start position:0%
use another platform so there's

03:42:42.550 --> 03:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
different prices that are associated
 

03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:44.349 align:start position:0%
different prices that are associated
with<03:42:42.720><c> that</c><03:42:42.840><c> so</c><03:42:43.000><c> that's</c><03:42:43.199><c> where</c><03:42:43.399><c> that</c><03:42:43.920><c> number</c><03:42:44.199><c> is</c>

03:42:44.349 --> 03:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
with that so that's where that number is
 

03:42:44.359 --> 03:42:45.750 align:start position:0%
with that so that's where that number is

03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
coming from
 

03:42:45.760 --> 03:42:50.389 align:start position:0%

follow<03:42:46.600><c> yes</c><03:42:47.600><c> so</c><03:42:48.000><c> so</c><03:42:48.399><c> thanks</c><03:42:48.680><c> for</c><03:42:48.920><c> that</c><03:42:49.479><c> but</c><03:42:49.920><c> but</c>

03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
follow yes so so thanks for that but but
 

03:42:50.399 --> 03:42:54.229 align:start position:0%
follow yes so so thanks for that but but
you<03:42:50.479><c> know</c><03:42:50.800><c> I</c><03:42:51.000><c> thought</c><03:42:51.680><c> that</c><03:42:52.159><c> um</c><03:42:52.920><c> that</c><03:42:53.920><c> that</c>

03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know I thought that um that that
 

03:42:54.239 --> 03:42:56.630 align:start position:0%
you know I thought that um that that
basically<03:42:54.760><c> went</c><03:42:55.520><c> for</c><03:42:55.720><c> instance</c><03:42:56.120><c> with</c><03:42:56.319><c> the</c>

03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
basically went for instance with the
 

03:42:56.640 --> 03:42:59.429 align:start position:0%

03:43:04.389 --> 03:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
then information was transmitted to the
 

03:43:04.399 --> 03:43:07.750 align:start position:0%
then information was transmitted to the

03:43:17.880 --> 03:43:20.510 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why why that couldn't be
