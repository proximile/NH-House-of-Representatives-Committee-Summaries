00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
I want to call this uh meeting of the
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
house rules committee to order and
 
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
our single thing on our menu right now
 
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
is to allow weight Drafting and
 
00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
introduction bill so representative Roy
 
00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 align:start position:0%
representative Mo Muse you want to come
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
us good morning thank you for convening
 
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
and being willing to hear us this
 
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
morning um I'll start and I'll turn it
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
over to representative
 
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
Muse after the news of the um tragic
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
killing of Chief ha as the chair of the
 
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee I looked into
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
it to see what if anything was necessary
 
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
that we could do and kind of see what
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
the current state of the law was um and
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
the current state of the law in New
 
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is similar to the federal law
 
00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
in that if you are involuntarily
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
committed you are barred from owning
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
Firearms or from purchasing fire
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
Firearms the problem we discovered is
 
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
that while New Hampshire recognizes that
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
there is no mechanism in current law for
 
00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
that report to happen in that person's
 
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
name to be entered into the Nick system
 
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
so there's a gap between our recognizing
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
it and it actually
 
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
happening representative Muse and I have
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
I believe got elected at the same time
 
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
we've been here this is our third term I
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
like to consider myself one of the stous
 
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
defendant of the Second Amendment and
 
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
when I thought about introducing this
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
legislation I thought to make sure that
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
we do this correctly and get everyone's
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
Buy in the first name that popped in my
 
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
head was representative Muse who's been
 
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
one of the strong strongest advocates
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
for gun
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
control for us to be together here today
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
tells you something that we think that
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
this is serious and we think it needs to
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
be addressed now and I'll turn it over
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.350 align:start position:0%
to representative
Muse

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
Muse
 
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
there are over 40 other states uh in
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
this country that actually send uh
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Data reporting data uh to
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
the next system uh so we're not we would
 
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
not be outliers by sending data to the
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
system there are uh I think there are
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
some pretty compelling reasons uh to do
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
this and one of the most compelling
 
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
reasons uh was what likely happened uh a
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago at New Hampshire
 
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
hospital um we're in a situation right
 
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 align:start position:0%
now where where people who
 
00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
basically um may not be in control uh of
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
themselves who may have severe mental
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
illness are in a position where they can
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
walk into a gun store and and buy a
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
firearm um and I think one of the things
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
that we have consistently recognized is
 
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
while all of us have a right to uh you
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
know to own a firearm under the
 
00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution um I don't think anybody
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
body wants a firearm in the hands of
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
somebody um who is subject to things
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
like um acts of
 
00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 align:start position:0%
psychosis uh and who uh is literally not
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
in control of themselves uh and and I
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
think that's the thing that we are we're
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
really trying to stop
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I I do want to say
 
00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
is that there is a tremendous amount to
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
unpack with legislation like this one of
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
the things that we want to make sure of
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh is that if we have a Prohibition on
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
weapons for people with certain mental
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
health conditions that if those people
 
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
get better uh they have a way to retain
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
their right to uh to to own weapons
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
again so there's a way uh to uh to
 
00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
reverse uh this process when people get
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
better there are some complexities
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
though uh there are people who are on uh
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
medication on an ongoing basis for
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
psychotic episodes who if they go off
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
their medication
 
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
may not be people that we want to
 
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
possess weapons so there are going to be
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
issues like that that we need to look
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
into so to help us work through these
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
issues I I think we're not only going to
 
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
be in touch with uh Folks at the
 
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office but we've also
 
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
involved um uh Holly Stevens uh and
 
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
Susan Sterns from Nami uh to help make
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
sure that whatever we do uh we don't
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
wind up uh further uh stigmatizing uh
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
people with mental health conditions so
 
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we are are going
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
to try to do in the legislation that we
 
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
submit is to make sure that we properly
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
balance the public safety concerns which
 
00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:47.959 align:start position:0%
right now are out of balance um with the
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
concern that we not only don't
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
stigmatize uh people with mental health
 
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
conditions but also people who may need
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
treatment um we don't want to
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily provide a huge dis incentive
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
for them to refuse treatment because
 
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
they think their their guns may be taken
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
away from them so again there a lot of
 
00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
issues to work through a lot of issues
 
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
to unpack uh but we we really are hoping
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh that we'll get your support to file
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
uh this legislation
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
today if I could just add um quickly um
 
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
I'm particularly cognizant of the fact
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
that we have been at War for decades and
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
as part of that we have thousands of
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
veterans um who who have PTSD and who
 
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
need and seek routinely um mental health
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
treatment and I would want to do nothing
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
that would discourage them from getting
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
the help they need nor would I want to
 
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
punish them um with the greatest of
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
tragic ironies by taking their rights
 
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
away because they went to defend ours so
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
we're going to be very diligent and very
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
careful and crafting this legislation um
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
as representative you said so that no
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
one is punished for seeking the help
 
00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
that they need while at the same time
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
balancing the need of the public to be
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
safe to ensure that Firearms do not end
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
up in the hands of people who definitely
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
do not have them and um I've recruited
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
um representative Stone who's all going
 
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
to also going to co-sponsor the bill and
 
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
he's already working on the restoration
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
of Rights process which is indeed
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
complicated the um any program you
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
devise to get the restoration of Rights
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
has to meet the criteria from the US
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and the ATF and
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
you actually have to get them to sign
 
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:31.240 align:start position:0%
sign off on it before you can do it
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise it will be meaningless in
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
other words you could say someone has
 
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
their rights back but when they go to
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
buy a gun they'll still be on the list
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
because the ATF did not approve the
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
program so we have to make sure that we
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
it meets those criteria so with that I
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
we would appreciate your your allowing
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
us to do this as you know this was
 
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
unforeseen we could not have thought of
 
00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
this and done this in time to do it
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
according to house rules thank you
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:04.629 align:start position:0%
according to house rules thank you
questions

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%

Denis Smith thank you Mr chair well
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
before discussion first I'd like to move
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
to approve the request
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%

have any questions or you just makeing
go

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
ahead and uh and thank you Mr chair for
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
allowing this to go beyond the usual
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
scope of why the drafting is late I
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
think we all recognize that um do you
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
representative Roy believe that the
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
proposal you're putting puts enough
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
respect and focus on the due process
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
rights of the affected
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you I do and and while
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's difficult because I have no
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
legislation in front of me obviously
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
because OS won't draft it until you say
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
they can um but what we are envisioning
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
um purely follows the federal law the
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires if you are
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed that means not
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
because you went on your own to get help
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
but because you refused to get help or
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
you were unable to get it on yourself a
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
judge commits you involuntarily part of
 
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
that process in the Hampshire law is
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
adversarial you are entitled to a lawyer
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
um if you cannot afford one one will be
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
appointed to you so that the due process
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
is definitely involved um the person has
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
a has a right to challenge this before
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
it happens they're allowed to call
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
witnesses they're allowed to speak in
 
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
their own defense um only after that
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
process is done and the judge enters an
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
order of involuntary commitment would
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
the person be added to the list and
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
likewise on the other end due process is
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
also involved in getting their rights
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
restored where they go to a judge and
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
they present evidence why they no longer
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
should be on that
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
list thank youat
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
