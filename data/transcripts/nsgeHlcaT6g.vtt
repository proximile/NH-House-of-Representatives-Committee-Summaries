st7
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
discuss yes I'll just speak briefly um
 
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
the bill uh certainly has an adoral
 
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
intent in that it seeks to uh further
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
protect students from the unreasonable
 
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
predations of hazing behavior on college
 
00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
campuses however as drafted there are
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
considerable issues with interpretation
 
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
and the language some of the language
 
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
appears to be so broad that behavior
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
such as cramming for a test late into
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
the night or uh being subjected to
 
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
participating outdoor activity in the
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
rain or even just simply being a pledge
 
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
being excluded from an
 
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
organization uh could theoretically
 
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
constitute hazing Behavior under this
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
bill um we like the intent we'd like to
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
continue to look at this bill and to see
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
if we can work on it to see if we can
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
narrow these things a bit further so
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair I absolutely
 
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion and I
 
00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
just advise to Comm there's going to be
 
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
a number of bills today which we're not
 
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
going to agree on and so we know that
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
and we're just going to have emotions
 
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
made no discussion get them off our
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
plate we'll end up where we know we're
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
going no sense wasting time so at this
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
point in time we have concurring
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%

we're going to bounce back up on our
 
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
listing here we're going to look at HB
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
1206 I know it should be 126 numerical
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
order it take moment yeah yeah we all
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
are jumping like
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
represent Miler you recognize for a
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
motion I I recommend
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
I and
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
I I have an amendment coming to 1206 we
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
were gonna wait
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I thought that was
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
1397 no
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
oh 1397 yes I will have to amend but
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to get together this is 1206
 
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
amendment and it takes out the part that
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
most people
 
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:16.430 align:start position:0%
most people
objected

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
just well here we are and you said it
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't an early Bill and that was
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
fun the reason why we jump to other
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
bills right now is the early bills we
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
need to have everybody present and we
 
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
have one person out testifying in
 
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
another location right now so we're not
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
taking up any early bills till we have a
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
full deck well that's fine but this has
 
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
be well take that an entire you want to
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
withraw your motion so we can move on oh
 
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
withdrawn okay
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
um are you good with the
 
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
11:07 that's the that's the one we
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
yeah par me we we're trying to decide
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
which one we're going
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:48.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
only because sing around we're doing the
 
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:58.030 align:start position:0%
only because sing around we're doing the
order

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.150 align:start position:0%
 
sheet

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:start position:0%

on okay check one two okay I think we're
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
ready to go the bill which we're looking
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
at 16 70 relative to including all
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
special education costs under State
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
education grants represent you recognize
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
for a motion I make a motion of itl is
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
there a
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
second second okay we have a motion made
 
00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
by represent Dr itl and 1670 second by
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
represent beler represent dve would you
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion yes just
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
briefly um on this coming Friday the
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is going to talk about two
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
bills one that deals with special
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
education one that deals with swept this
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
bill 1670 deals with both of those we
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
have another bill about a committee to
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
study this I think there's just too many
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
irons in the fire all these things that
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
are brought up in this bill will I'm
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
sure get talked about when we work in
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee OR subsequent
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
bills further discuss forming uh
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
specialed funding in order to take some
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
of the weight off of localities but my
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
concern in this particular bill is that
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
it creates a seriously upside down
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
incentive structure whereby the state
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
provides all of funding but the local
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
districts provide all of the approvals
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that could turn out in
 
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
a in a very bad uh fiscal spiral that
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ultimately help further
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee of
 
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.990 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee of
Representative

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I would
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
encourage people to not support the itl
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
we have been not making progress with
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
funding for 30 years this may not be the
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
perfect bill but it needs to go forward
 
00:13:58.990 --> 00:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
while the other work is being done at
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
least at this point in the
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
process further
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
mil yes so I'm going to oppose the itl
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
on the motion on the basis that I think
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
that should be put at least into INF
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
study uh we have uh dealt with uh
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
specialed issues on this committee uh
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
for years without really ever looking at
 
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
it and I know that we have a pending
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill that's going to be coming before us
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
that looks that will look at the total
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
thing and I I
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
understand that uh this is part of that
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
total thing and my sense is I would
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
rather put this into inm study and from
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
a policy standpoint from this committee
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
indicate that this is an important issue
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
that must be dealt with uh even and by
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
putting an interim study it sits there
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
and then when the other hopefully the
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
commission will uh pass and this then
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
can be brought back as a topic for that
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
commission to deal with so I I would I
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
would encourage enage you to vote no on
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%

motion yes thank
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
you this is universal elig ibility for
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
and the legislature has decided that we
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
should fund
 
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
education and we keep hearing over and
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
over that all students are ours and all
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
students should get a good
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
education um and so I would like to
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
submit that this would be a way for all
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
students to get a good education
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
such that any student for whom their zip
 
00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:35.430 align:start position:0%
such that any student for whom their zip
code

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
assigned school public school is not
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
working not to say that it's a bad
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
school but it's not working for them
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
that they would have the option of
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
coming up with what does work for them
 
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
whether that's a neighboring Public
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
School a charter school a private school
 
00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:00.039 align:start position:0%
home school college or some combination
 
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
of all of those that this would be the
 
00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:06.039 align:start position:0%
way to help ensure that all kids get a
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
good education thank you thank you does
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
the second want to make any
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
discussion not hearing any
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
chair we have uh five voucher bills
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
before before this committee so I'm only
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
going to say this
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
once uh um we have been uh the minority
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
here has been very patient around the
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
voucher issue we've not put put forward
 
00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:38.470 align:start position:0%
voucher issue we've not put put forward
a

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
repeal we have put forward in last year
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
and also this year several guideline
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
bills each one of those guideline bills
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
have been summarily
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
defeated we are dealing with a program
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
here that is a very costly program that
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
frankly takes money away from public
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.430 align:start position:0%
frankly takes money away from public
education

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that this kind of a
 
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:05.559 align:start position:0%
program does not have any gu guard rails
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
we' tried to work within the system to
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
provide those guard rails but they've
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
dismissed this is opening this Universal
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
program and the others that you have
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the one that's
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
coming forward with that moves it from
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
350 to uh
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
500 this program was purported by the
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education as a a program
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
that would help impoverished children
 
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
get a voucher to go to a school of their
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
choice this basically changes the intent
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
of the original program and frankly when
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
it was just initially advocated we said
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
well this is just the camel's nose Under
 
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:48.990 align:start position:0%
well this is just the camel's nose Under
the

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
Tent well the camel is now within the
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
tent it's no longer under the nose of
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
the tent it is in the
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
tent so I'm not going to speak any
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
further on
 
00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
vouchers because you know where we are
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
we know where you are you know where we
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
are my senses let's just move to vote
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
and fight it on the floor I concur on
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
that and I concur that with the other
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
EFA bills are coming up too let's just
 
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
get to the point and when the with the
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
person makes that motion just say no and
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
second not and we're just going to move
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
right to the to the vote so
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
any further discussion I want to limit
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.509 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
1553 make motion okay I'd like to jump
 
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
to uh HB 1553 that is an early
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 1553 yeah you got to get to it too
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
paper control time
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
time

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
this is a bill relative to establishing
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
a pilot program under the Department of
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
Education to offer spelling to
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
communicate services to students with
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
autism and phasia I have a motion
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
represent M you recognize for a motion
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to it all this motion please
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:33.629 align:start position:0%
 
further

00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
discussion from the the maker of the
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
motion um you know uh we thank you Mr
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
chair we looked at this and obviously
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
the parents that were
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
here um had a significant impact on
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
their CH there's no question about that
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh the issue though I think that we
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
doubt with the pathologist the speech
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
pathologist that was here that it's just
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
one of many programs that are out there
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
and that to just to identify one program
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
here for this kind of a pilot uh we
 
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
thought was just unnecessary so I I I
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
would urge you to itl this thank
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
you and I I'll uh indicate that ashes
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
come out strongly against this they're
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
opposed to it as well as I think there
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
are some issues with the
 
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
the I'll call it the science behind it
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh so represent belard did you have your
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I I'm going to
 
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
not support the itl motion on this and
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
here's why I will freely admit that
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
within this program by the introduction
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
of a second party to help somebody
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
communicate you introduced the implicit
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
possibility of bias that can happen
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
however all of the testimony that we
 
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
heard against this bill hinged on a
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
judgment that said that essentially if a
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
person cannot communicate autonomously
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate to introduce a second
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
person to help them to communicate but
 
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
that's not a technical matter that is a
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
value judgment it's a value judgment I
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
disagree with because I believe it's
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
possible that there is a percentage of
 
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
this population that is incapable of
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
with our current technology and and
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge communicating autonomously
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
effectively but they may have some
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
ability to communicate with an
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
intermediary and with a second person
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
involved I think we should give those
 
00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
people the opportunity by giving them
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
this pilot program to see if we can
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
gather some data that that demonstrates
 
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
this might be effective uh and finally I
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
I don't think that value judgment is up
 
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
to these organizations to make I think
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
that's up to us to make it thank you
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
further discussion representa Celli uh
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
thank you we've talked about things
 
00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:43.070 align:start position:0%
thank you we've talked about things
being

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and I don't think at this
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
point um this program is evidence-based
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
and we've heard testimony to that um you
 
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.789 align:start position:0%
and we've heard testimony to that um you
know

00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
I've been behind many special education
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
bills so
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
um you know this this is a difficult
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
vote for me but um you know I had
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
firsthand testimony from my daughter
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
who's a special ed teacher about someone
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
doing this program the parents saying
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
that their child was writing novels
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
using this approach but when the parent
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
brought that child to my teacher's
 
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
classroom the child couldn't pick out
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
letters on the letter board but yet the
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
parents said she was writing novels with
 
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
this other teacher who was um uh helping
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
her use the letter board uh so I think
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
there's too many questions in my mind um
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
I think there's research going on um I
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
don't know that if it's I don't know
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
that it's uh dependent on us to find to
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
fund a pilot project um districts could
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
uh TR have someone trained now and try
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
it out on their own
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh so that is the reason for my uh
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
vote further discussion representa Damon
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to say that I'm
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to reluctantly support the itl
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the evidence it's
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
not science-based enough at this
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
point however I keep thinking that this
 
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.950 align:start position:0%
point however I keep thinking that this
might

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
be like Lorenzo's Oil if people remember
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
that it was a documentary movie and it
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
reported decades
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
later on a couple of parents I believe
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
they were
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
neuroscientists whose son was profoundly
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
epileptic he had you know three dozen
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
seizures a day and they ultimately
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
proved against all scientific
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
odds that eating
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
a 90% fat diet diminish the frequency of
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
seizures in a certain population of
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
epileptics and so so anyway without
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
going on and on I wonder if in some
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
years to come this will be a standard
 
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
practice I do support the IDE itl
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the Science
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
Now repand
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
Dr thank you Mr chairman um just the
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
fact that we don't have very many
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotes and we don't have data um
 
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
makes me want to not support the itl
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
because I think this is a pilot program
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
that will have eyes on it that can bring
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
us some data if we don't have data a
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
pilot program is the way to get
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
it perhaps
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
leus we keep talking about thinking
 
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
outside the box and this is thinking
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
outside the box and so it seems to me
 
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
like it would be wrong to vote against
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
this when this is an opportunity to try
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
work representative cascaden thank you
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um just in talking to a
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
specialist in the field
 
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
um that are really highly qualified um
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
this is a program that obviously seemed
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
to work with some of the adults that
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
were presented here but I was
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
transitioning the method of this program
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
which is facilitated
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
communication with a 6 7 8 9 10 year old
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
and it requires physical reinforcement
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
in other words you might have to take
 
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
the kid's hand and place it and you tell
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
me what kind of parent would say it's
 
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
okay to grab your kids' wrist so they
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
can learn the spelling board at this
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
point I can't support it for those
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
reasons because the examples that were
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
given were
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
adults they weren't kids um that's
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
something to be careful about thank you
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm just going to tack in
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
on it my my own daughter is a speech
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
pathologist audiologist uh from univers
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
South Carolina Charles medical school
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
she works in schools with the prek 1 two
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
three um she has seen this rapid
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
responding type program work and it
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
echoes what you just said represent
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
cascaden and there is there's a lack of
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
science behind it and she sees a lack of
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
productivity from it as well and so for
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
that reason I believe that these
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
professionals that have their
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
seas and they're highly trained this
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
area of instruction uh I'm going to go
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
along with those professionals thank you
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
further discuss represent parel I'm
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't really want to believe
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
labor this point however I do want to
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
say because I thought I was actually in
 
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
support of this bill um that
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden testimony just
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
um made a very good point that we were
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
um hearing from adults who we don't know
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
how much education or input they had had
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
their entire lives and then maybe this
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
was finally the piece
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
of information that they needed to help
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
them communicate um so I'll be voting
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
itl is there any further discussion not
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%

the majority I'm what I'm major oh was
 
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
IDE sorry it's long I didn't change my
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
the report for majority okay Bel will
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
write the uh Minority
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
um the other early Bill we have is 1570
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
but we are waiting for an amendment on
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
so I think this takes care of those
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
early bills which we did have to do
 
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.750 align:start position:0%
early bills which we did have to do

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
right so then we'll go right to the top
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
117 yeah why you take
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
already yeah we do have an amendment I
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
have an amendment right here which we
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
had talked about uh a
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
definition I wonder if there was
 
00:42:51.839 --> 00:42:53.470 align:start position:0%
definition I wonder if there was
anything

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:42:58.109 --> 00:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
else yeah yeah okay House Bill 1107 is
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
relative to school curriculum Frameworks
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
and I call on uh chairman lad for a
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
motion uh yes I'd like to move
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
OTP second representative
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
Miler I as maker I'd like to also offer
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
110 or uh
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
around

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
way uh as that's going around I'll just
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
speak very briefly to the
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
bill we talked about it me to the
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amendment the there
 
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion regarding uh
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
the definition which was down in the
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
bottom part of that bill online excuse
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
me 28 29 and 30 it didn't really Echo
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
what had been said elsewhere in the bill
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that this conversation is
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
very accurate this uh is an amendment
 
00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
defining the curriculum framework
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum framework means an organized
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
plan of study that serves as a guide and
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
reference to what New Hampshire students
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
should know and be able to do in a
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
learning area and identifies the
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
academic standards for each learning
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
area pursuant to RSA 190 uh 3 E2 a Roman
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
1 a so what it does it's it's um takes
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
from what we're talking about uh the the
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks up earlier in the
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
bill what students should know and be
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
able to do and as a dentified in the
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
substantive criteria for an adequate
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
education that's referenced uh it
 
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
establish the academic standards the AC
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
academic standards will be incorporated
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
into the curriculum Frameworks and
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
specifically stated as the academic
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
standards so I believe that's the whole
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
gist of the amendment and this is ought
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
to pass on the amendment correct yeah
 
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
did we even I did not get that did I
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much um so I'd like
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
to Mo make a motion otpa on the
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
amendment sir second by representative
 
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:start position:0%

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.309 align:start position:0%
Miler uh any further discussion on the
amendment

00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
no yes representative Tanner thank you I
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just um wondering
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
why or if it makes any difference that
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the original it said a line guide for
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
instruction that is aligned with the
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
academic standards
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
versus um serves as a guide and
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment are you are you looking at
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
line four on the amendment is
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
that line 20 sorry I'm looking at line
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
29 in the original Bill and then I'm
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
looking at um line four that says it
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
serves as a guide and reference um
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
rather than that the instruction shall
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
be aligned um align seems to be taken
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
out of the amendment and I'm just
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
wondering if it you know how that makes
 
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.750 align:start position:0%
wondering if it you know how that makes
a

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
difference and is that difference
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
significant well I I'll respond to that
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
where the curriculum frame works are
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
according to this definition must
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
identify the academic standards and
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
academic standards are approved by the
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education for the
 
00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:35.309 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education for the
specific

00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
subjects that 1932a speaks to I can only
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
assume that academic standards would be
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
built upon the subject
 
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
areas and that's just basic you know and
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't speak to instruction but
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
instruction and curriculum and
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
assessment all have to be aligned that's
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
just good best practice so I would say
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
the word aligned is is a a best practice
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
and uh it should be clearly
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
understood any further you're not going
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
to develop curriculum Frameworks that
 
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
this the curriculum Frameworks are
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
developed by the
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
department and academic standards as
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
well so they they they work hand in hand
 
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
followup followup just to me aligned
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
legislation um kind of predicts what's
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
going to be in the Frameworks or is the
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
basis for the Frameworks whereas this is
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
it it serves as a guide and
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
reference rather than has to be aligned
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where I have a little
 
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
hiccup on
 
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
it any further yes represent
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that using the word align
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
is a stronger
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
statement of what's trying to be
 
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.990 align:start position:0%
statement of what's trying to be
achieved

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
achieved
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
in section
 
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
D and I'm wondering Mr chair if you
 
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.510 align:start position:0%
D and I'm wondering Mr chair if you
would

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
entertain an amendment to the amendment
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
or a new amendment that does in include
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
a lined in there I I think the amendment
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
is helpful in being more specific in
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
some ways
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
but I I think not having the word
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
strong any further discussion on the
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendment so you would say to do in a
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
learning area and identifies the
 
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
academic standards aligned for each
 
00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.390 align:start position:0%
academic standards aligned for each
learning

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
learning
 
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
area aligned with each learning area yes
 
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
okay I have no problem with that if we
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
want to get an amendment I'm willing to
 
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.430 align:start position:0%
do that
is

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
um is the representative CAD you had
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
your hand up first uh thank you um the
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks in in the uh major
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
disciplines that were developed were
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
state task force that included a variety
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
of people on it throughout the state and
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
I mean in my 45 years that was some of
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
the best guidance that school districts
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
had and from there they could develop
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
their programs their curriculum it all
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
filtered back to the curriculum
 
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
Frameworks what I'm um concerned about
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
and would like to know whether this bill
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
will move things
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
forward is a social I spoke to a
 
00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:40.799 align:start position:0%
gentleman from stratum who served on the
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
social studies curriculum which was a
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
very difficult one compared to say
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
science and then they adopted The Next
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
Gen Science curriculum and then they
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
tailored it the reading was a state task
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
force the math was a state task force
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
and was updated when we added Algebra 1
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
but the social studies has lingered and
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
this gentleman who was on this Statewide
 
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
task force so they completed their work
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
and delivered it to be acted on and that
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
was 5 years ago and not a thing has been
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
done since that so I think it's
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
important that somehow this bill does
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
require at least in the four main
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
categories of English English reading
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
math social stud science we have those
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
Frameworks for school districts to then
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
build their programs because then you've
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
got some consistency because we're all
 
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
taking the state test but it really
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell the districts what program
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
to buy what curriculum to use they were
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
Broad and it's what we wanted every
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
single student in New Hampshire to know
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
and be able to do no matter where they
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
went to school and it's important we
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind is all children um so
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that this this bill and I do
 
00:50:59.710 --> 00:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
support it obviously um because it's a
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
very important tool to help education in
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
the whole state should be um delivered
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
in a sense so thank you thank you uh
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
rent Woodcock thank you repres cell um I
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
just want to follow up on represent C
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
Caden's comment I don't think we should
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
hold off on a change of a word because I
 
00:51:22.109 --> 00:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
don't think the word is as relevant as
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
the attend of the bill um it's on the
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
table and it's I think it should pass
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
but I do want to Echo and I just talking
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
in my P here at to the right these
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
things some of these are 20 years old
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education hasn't done
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
anything in 20 years you mean to tell me
 
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
the 203 Health Frameworks nothing's
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
happened in 20 years the field of health
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
so I agree this this is well needed
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking 10 15 years old and
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
they're doing nothing over there I just
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be clear in terms of
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
the curriculum development this is we're
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
basing everything on curriculum and
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
structure and assessment and we use
 
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
information 20 years old that's all but
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
I do agree appreciate representative lad
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
moving this forward thank you
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
representative lad yeah I I concur uh
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
the Frameworks certainly serve as a
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
guide and a reference for instructors in
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
the field and for when you are
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
identifying the curriculum to teach
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
these academic standards that's a local
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility but the academic
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
standards are the the guide for all this
 
00:52:25.079 --> 00:52:26.230 align:start position:0%
standards are the the guide for all this
um

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
I I also feel that we're operating on
 
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks that are ancient
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
history 2003 we're talking about health
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
2006 we're talking social studies uh the
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
recent ones which have been identified
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
are the mathematics and the science Next
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
Generation science those are current and
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
and appropriate however uh the other
 
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
areas were lagging I I kind of disagree
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit with what represent
 
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
cascaden said that those four or five
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
main subjects they're all main subjects
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
to me physical education Health that
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
they all need a curriculum framework
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
they need to have academic standards
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
clearly stated within giving direction
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
to our people in the field so I have no
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
problem with putting aligned in here um
 
00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's the the key is that
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
we are identifying academic standards
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
will appear will be identified in the
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
Frameworks I think that's the biggest
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
key to the whole thing would would
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
represent mil yeah would this uh I'm
 
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
looking at line four on the
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
amendment if it were to read as guide
 
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.829 align:start position:0%
amendment if it were to read as guide
and

00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
reference uh be aligned with what
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
students should know you would add be
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
that yeah okay
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
I'll Tanner so I think aligned is a
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
active verb so you have to do something
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
rather than just identify look at it and
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
say oh yeah identify it or Define it and
 
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
I think what I what it what it says to
 
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
me is that in the original Bill okay and
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
I understand the you know what students
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
need to know and able to do in the
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
learning area that's that's fine but it
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
says that it is aligned with academic
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
standards for each learning area
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 193 whatever aligned
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
means that it's got to be set up it when
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
people look at it it it's they've got to
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
make a judgment or not a judgment but an
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
act of
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
um activity that actually puts one the
 
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
Frameworks with the standards
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
identifying it just means well okay so
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
this is the standard and we're
 
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
identifying something in in the
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
Frameworks um I just think it to me it's
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
it's an important difference in in that
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
sentence and that's why I'm making a big
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
deal about it thank you representative
 
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
Heath thank you for taking my question
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's kind of more of a comment in a
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
question um many years ago working at
 
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
the department we spent hours doing
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum work we had curriculum
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
specialists at the department of Ed that
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
brought together and led these
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
conversations across our state involved
 
00:55:30.799 --> 00:55:32.430 align:start position:0%
conversations across our state involved
teachers

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
administrators it's my understanding
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
that right now at the department there
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
are no curriculum people we don't have a
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
math curriculum person we don't have
 
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
science um the last one I believe was
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
Marsha mcaffrey who was the Arts and she
 
00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
was not replaced when she left so my
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
question is if if we're going to put
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
this in place um who's expected to do
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
this work
 
00:55:59.309 --> 00:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
EXC question represent
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
L that's a very good question we are
 
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:03.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum shallow at the Department of
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
Education absolutely I'm I'm a little
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
discouraged on that in the school
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
district I worked in in
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
Alaska the curriculum Department took
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
care of this whole
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
floor and we had peep specialists in all
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
area right down to Media
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
Services uh gifted and talented the
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
whole n yards and I think that the the
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
Department's struggling with the
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
allocation of dollars which we have and
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
to to support curriculum and they just
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
don't have that available they need to
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
make those those decisions we have asked
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
I have asked numerous times to folks
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
that testify what are your priorities
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
for the budget policy-wise I've never
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
ever gotten a response never from from
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
Department this goes back over multiple
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as well so I I I I can
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
remember having that Frank discussion
 
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
with commissioner
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
Barry and with Paul leather who was one
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
that was very engaged in
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
mathematics so um I you know I have no
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
problem in amending this uh but where I
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
think if you're going to do it the it
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
has to be at the the academic standards
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
aligned with each learning area to
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's where I put it rather than the
 
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
front side because the front side the
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks would serve as a
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
reference and guide incorporating those
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
standards which are aligned with the
 
00:57:39.069 --> 00:57:39.079 align:start position:0%
with the subject areas in
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
statute um so I I I I think that we got
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
to be very careful where we put this I
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put in the front side I put it
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
right in line five right after academic
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
standards aligned with each learning
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
area pursuant
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
to so uh representative lad um is it
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
your intention to uh submit an amendment
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
um based on this discussion absolutely
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
we could you
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
know stop this bill right where it is I
 
00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:09.039 align:start position:0%
could hand this to
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
call okay um if there's no objection uh
 
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.029 align:start position:0%
call okay um if there's no objection uh
representa

00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
representa
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
Damon I have a different comment than
 
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
the topic about alignment so I don't
 
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
know if I should forward with that at
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
this moment or not um pertains to
 
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment right why we hold off and
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
we'll do all the Amendments at the same
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
time then when we get this one back okay
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
what was your comment thank
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
you so I'm appreciating the value of the
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks and I'm also
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
concerned that putting this bill forward
 
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
when there seems to be consensus that
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
the existing curriculum framew
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
Frameworks in most topic areas are very
 
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.710 align:start position:0%
Frameworks in most topic areas are very
dat

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
dat
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
should there perhaps be included in this
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
bill a requirement for them to be
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
updated on some particular frequency
 
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
every five or 10 or whatever years
 
00:59:12.029 --> 00:59:12.039 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we're saying align
 
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
with health standards from 2003 I mean
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
want ruption of
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
lead there there I think we have several
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
issues which we have to
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
address and we we can say we want to
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
have Emergency Management plans in at a
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
certain date they don't come so what
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
what 20% came and then after Perry
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
plumber got on them we got 50 something
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
B then we got 80% after we threatened
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't get any money um the same
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
thing occurs in the curriculum areas
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
though there there's going to have have
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
to be a concerted look at the by the
 
00:59:59.710 --> 00:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education which they're
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
the ones to approve these academic
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
standards do we have the staff necessary
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
to make this work and what kind of
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
budget are we going to present to the
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
legislature to request the dollars to do
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
this Excuse me yes go ahead so I you
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
know I I think but it's time
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
for this is this is core to what we're
 
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
doing in schools this is Centric to it
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
and and I feel that this is one of the
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
reasons why we see some scattered
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
achievement scores throughout the state
 
01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
because I don't think many people are
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
really provided here's what we have to
 
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
teach they're not looking back at 2003
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
they're not looking at 2006 or even 2008
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
Frameworks which they were all done
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
those various times except the recent
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
ones so they're looking for guidance and
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
if if we want kids coming out knowing
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
this stuff out of school then we have to
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
we have to be on top of this I think
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's got to be a responsibility the
 
01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
state board and the department
 
01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:04.039 align:start position:0%
requesting through their approp their
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
budget each year and I will go to
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
representative you know Heath's
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
committee on finance support
 
01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
it we've had that discussion before when
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
we wanted counselors in the school to
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
help us with the CTE
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
programs and I don't know if that's
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
hitting it either anymore because we're
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
still at the same 177% of our students
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
participating in CTE we need at least
 
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.150 align:start position:0%
participating in CTE we need at least
double

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
double
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
that so uh I I think by it it's it's I
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying represent
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
Damon but I I think that we have to the
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
state board has to recognize this is an
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
issue and along with the administration
 
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
at the at the Department of Education
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
and and and and and um move on it I
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't think more legislation is going to
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
make it work representative Woodcock i'
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
like to comment on the on both of these
 
01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not I agree represent will add uh
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
that has to be done and and it should be
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
done quickly I don't agree however that
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
the budget is the answer to this this
 
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
has not been a priority of
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
doe they got a gazing priorities but
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
culum instruction and assessment aren't
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
the three and they're the fundamental
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
piece of education and that's the part
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
we can go we all the all the budget they
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
have the budget they prioritize that
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
this is not a priority Department of
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
Education that's the unfortunate part
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
you're exactly right represent lad 2003
 
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't make
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
it the issue is that what subjects do we
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
assess Reading Writing arithmetic
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
science every so many years so we have
 
01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:41.799 align:start position:0%
next Generation science we have language
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
arts reading standards current we have
 
01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.109 align:start position:0%
arts reading standards current we have
math

01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
math
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
current social studies isn't tested
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
right so it's it's in the back seat so
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
we went the route of trying to have a
 
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
commission look at how we're going to
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
teach Civics we put it in law you will
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
have a halfe course in Middle School a
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
halfe course in the high school and you
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
will embed this in grades K through 7 or
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
six embed
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
Civics what are we doing about the
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum now we have a commission
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
looking at it we're going to get a
 
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
textbook um I agree with you well it's
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
not that's not going to hack it either
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to identify the
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
academic standards for K through
 
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
lakus I'm very
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
confused we keep saying that curriculum
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
is a is local control and yet now we're
 
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
having this conversation about how the
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
doe isn't doing
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum well Frameworks I know that's
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about but you you guys
 
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
were talking about curriculum and so
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
I'm confused I thought that was a
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
local can I respond to that quickly
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between what you're
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the the curriculum is a
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the local they want to
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
use hoton Mifflin silver bdet or some
 
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
other kind of box program that they can
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
do that or write their own
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
program the subjects which we're talking
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
about are those criteria inadequate
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
and those have academic standards that's
 
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
what we're addressing the academic
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
standards once we establish that then we
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
provide these curriculum Frameworks
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
which are model guidance and reference
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
type Frameworks for the schools to maybe
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
Echo use or say well we're going to take
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
this and incorporate it in but see I I
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
when you read the curriculum Frameworks
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
that I've looked at I kind of wander
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
through trying to find out where the
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
academic standards they're sort of
 
01:04:59.069 --> 01:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
immersed within and you have to really
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
kind of filter that out they're not
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
clearly stated the academic standards
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
for teaching the American Revolution are
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
here and they're stated within social
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
studies or whatever thing you're doing
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
in Civics and how to communicate and
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
live together so there there's a
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
difference between curriculum and
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
instruction that's all local totally
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
local this is the way the state helps
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
provide assistance to the districts and
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
then showing them here the academic
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
standards which you integrate into your
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
which guide your curriculum purchases
 
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
rep l so thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
and with um all due respect to what
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
represented lad was was just saying as
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
far as curriculum being 100% local no I
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
mean we've seen the Department of
 
01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
Education get get kneed deep involved in
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum and Prager you as a as as
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum for personal financial
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
literacy I think is a prime example of
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
that now if we had a curriculum
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
framework for personal financial
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
literacy that most schools would would
 
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
be a um a one semester um class
 
01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:10.230 align:start position:0%
requiring a student to
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:11.829 align:start position:0%
requiring a student to
[Music]

01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
be how how many hours is a one semester
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
class 30 hours maybe of uh of of inclass
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
time as opposed to 15 4 and 1 half
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
minute um videos which is what Prager
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
you I think a curriculum framework would
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
probably lay out um uh something for
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
personal financial literacy that Prager
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
you doesn't even come close to covering
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
and I think this goes to representative
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
woodcock's point is that the uh the
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner had zero interest in um in
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
developing curricular Frameworks
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
because their ability I do not want to
 
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
their ability to develop curriculum it's
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
talk about the department talk about you
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
know Administration but I don't want to
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
hear specific individuals because it's
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
there is an issue we do not have
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum staff over there I I totally
 
01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
agree with you on that
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
representative represent
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
cascad thank you um I consider myself to
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
have a lot of patience sometimes um the
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
thing that is
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
disheartening is that every single
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
person in your
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
seat wants students educated no matter
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
how and the problem that we have
 
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
entailed is a strong
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
division right some are fighting for one
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
kind some are fighting for another kind
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire has a reputation
 
01:07:47.549 --> 01:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
nationally to be a high standards
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
rigorous education system I've had
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
multiple students transfer in from other
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
states and they are nowhere near
 
01:07:58.269 --> 01:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
prepared to New Hampshire students and
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
we have also had a numerous number of
 
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
graduates from our high schools from
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
some of our homeschool programs from our
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
religious schools that are doctors
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
lawyers are very
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
successful and when we go to a test
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
score you know that's only one day one
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
moment in time and they aren't as great
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
as we want them to be but if you know
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
human behavior there's a bell-shaped
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
curve you'll always have high Achievers
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
low Achievers middle Achievers but I
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
believe that the problem that we're not
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
doing well in test scores overall or
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
over time because you don't take one
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
year data as the tell all you got to
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
watch for a pattern is that the division
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
in this state is to fight for one kind
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
of education versus another and until we
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
all promote every child in this state
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
then we're going to continue to have
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
problem so um we we have a an amendment
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
being drafted currently um and uh
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can um get that before too
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
long bigon do this all again this right
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
yes right so let's um let's turn this
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
back over to Chairman lad let's take a a
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
break everybody stand up walk down the
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%

01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
energy efficient or excuse me struck out
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
line then I was advised at the
 
01:31:08.719 --> 01:31:09.870 align:start position:0%
line then I was advised at the
commission

01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
meeting by a certain person at this
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
table that buses are infrastructure and
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
they are related to Public
 
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
Safety and surveillance and access
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
control and responding to by way of
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
cameras and equipment that might be
 
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
placed on these
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
buses and then the conversation went a
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
little further and said okay but this is
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
for energy efficient school buses the
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
question then maybe this should be
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
written so as school buses or other
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles used for transportation of
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
students so that we can put this
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
security stuff on any kind of
 
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
bus uh that where it's necessary so this
 
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
amendment strikes out the word energy
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
efficient and says school buses or other
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles used for transportation of
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
students I was contacted by the um oh
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
the uh Sierra Mountain Club want to know
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
why are you um taking away something
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
that's energy
 
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
efficient and that's not the intent of
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here the intent
 
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
is to try to support safety and this
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
whole area of public school
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we've been working with
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
that since 2018 there's a task force
 
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
report back in 2018 it was was done by
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
the governor and a task force which was
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
chaired by um Perry plumber director
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
plumber of Homeland Security and I wrote
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
out 48 plus recommendations of what we
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
need to do to make our schools more
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
secure and safe and healthy environment
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
for the kids and and we've been working
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
towards that end and the monies which
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
we've been allocated by the
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the the state here
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
have been used towards that very very
 
01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
purpose uh initially we had eate and we
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
kind of meshed it in a little bit with
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
Communications and the Federal grant
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
programs but we have really gravitated
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
towards making sure that every school
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
has had the opportunity apply and they
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
all have they all have and they've all
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
received grants the grants are up to
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
$100,000 per
 
01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
project and we have allocated to date a
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
little over $50 million over these years
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
for school security
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
actually we were informed by Perry
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
plumber when he was the homeand that we
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
are spending more per pupil in this
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
state for security than other states
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
which were to be commended on but we're
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
not there yet folks and there's a lot
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
that we have to do and this past year we
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
allocated another $10 million that money
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
has already been uh we've received the
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
applications we're processing those
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
applications right now so we're trying
 
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
to keep this fund for the purpose and
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
the intent of what we're using it for
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
right now and that's the safety security
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
access control making sure Arctic entry
 
01:33:59.790 --> 01:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
areas or entry areas to buildings are
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
there key codes all that safety glass
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
and we're making good strives but we
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to change course we want to
 
01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
stay on course and make sure we get all
 
01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.229 align:start position:0%
stay on course and make sure we get all
these

01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
schools where they need to be I can't
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
discuss a whole lot of it because we're
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
doing that in closed session uh so I
 
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
think this is another and I really
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
myself I I missed missed these school
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
buses that is infrastructure and many
 
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
states infrastructure is school buses
 
01:34:29.709 --> 01:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
and so we need to make sure that they
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
are safe and
 
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
secure so that's the purpose of this
 
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
bill and this that's the purpose of the
 
01:34:36.109 --> 01:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
amendment right and that was not to pass
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%

energy efficient school buses we know
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
from the speaker before there's only

recognize the importance of that program
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
however that is not a program available
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
within the school setting with school
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
funding and the intent of the bill is to
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
offer students partaking in civically
 
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:57.080 align:start position:0%

chair the is the issue here for for me

chair the is the issue here for for me
is

01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
not uh negative against the program
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's at that question here that's
 
01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.390 align:start position:0%
that's at that question here that's
that's

01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
not we have when when this originally
 
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:27.950 align:start position:0%
not we have when when this originally
came

01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
came
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
forward uh of having this uh High state
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
test given to kids before they have to
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
graduate we oppose
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
that and that's the basis of this
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to this is that if you do it
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
for one group why not another group
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the academic program of
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
Ry Etc I support that
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
but we passes originally for all kids
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of the program that they're
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
in and this changes that uh that
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
supposition of the basis of that
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
original program and that's why I will
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.629 --> 01:43:15.639 align:start position:0%
motion chairman lad yeah
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
um when we put the
 
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
this test assessment the United States
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
citizenship Immigration Services
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
assessment in place initially we had
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
other local assessments which could be
 
01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
done as
 
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
well and it's been changed to where we
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
are right now and as I said yesterday I
 
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
am not supportive of one test and I
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
think re cascad you mentioned this
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
earlier today one test is a shot in time
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
and it's not necessarily
 
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
reflection or
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
demonstration of of of student learning
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
and I believe that this program right
 
01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
here where it is you know local board
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
approved it's it's an elective course
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's got the Civics criteria that's
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
necessary that we have incorporated into
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
our Civics education but most
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
importantly to me we measure this not
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily through a test and these
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
tests it I I don't think this United
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
States citizen Immigration Services
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
assessment is a measure of of our social
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
studies or CICS or government to begin
 
01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
with and and and it doesn't have it
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass the criteria for being such
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
a test if we're going to have the same
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
questions over and over the 120
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
questions which I could go out and
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
memorize as well so it's not not a a a
 
01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
test which is aligned with Civics I
 
01:44:44.669 --> 01:44:44.679 align:start position:0%
believe in working with this Civics
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
commission rate this is more aligned
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
with what we're asking our young people
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
to come out of school
 
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
possessing and knowing how to work with
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
each other how to understand the
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
principles of this country and and how
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
to uh just function as United States
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
citizens should and they are learning to
 
01:45:07.470 --> 01:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer they're working in communities
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
and they are if you've ever been in
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
school and looked at one of these R
 
01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
Junior Ry programs is definitely doing
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
exactly what i' like to see every
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
student come out with and remember most
 
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
kids in this program are not going on in
 
01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:23.950 align:start position:0%
kids in this program are not going on in
the

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
military but they're acquiring this
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
information so again they got the
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
competencies so why not move forward
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
with this I think this is a great
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
opening the door saying there's more to
 
01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
assessment of a juner than one test in
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
time and I we heard this from teachers
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
who spoke in front of this committee
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
over and over and over so I'll conclude
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
my my discussion on on that represent
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you repr Celli I want to
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
make two comments first off the reason I
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
supported the amendment was anything
 
01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
that would get a student exempt from
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
this fictitious test I was supporting I
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
think I think the test has no value
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
citizenship test and I just heard
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative Milo who brought a
 
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
different philosophy to it and and opens
 
01:46:13.629 --> 01:46:13.639 align:start position:0%
my mind a little bit more and I just
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
heard the chair say he agrees as well
 
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
that this test is not valid it's just
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'm shamee we have the damp test there
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
alt together I not supporting the motion
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Tanner um Dido the
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
last couple speakers plus the fact that
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
we've in the
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
legislation specified that it's the 2020
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
immigration test so by specifying a
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
certain date it gets more out to date
 
01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
out of date every year that we provide
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
RSA yeah represent luno thank you Mr
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
chair so so I'm I'm looking at
 
01:46:58.990 --> 01:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
18911 in the um in our in our law books
 
01:47:03.149 --> 01:47:03.159 align:start position:0%
here and so it it starts on page
 
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
466 and there's a lot to it and I think
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
um representative lad spoke to this a
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
lot to the instruction of civics in New
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's well um it's well
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
laid out talks about a halfe course um
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
talks about uh instruction in a number
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
of different areas and that's all part
 
01:47:24.669 --> 01:47:24.679 align:start position:0%
of Roman 1 which is the bulk of 8911 and
 
01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
then there's Roman 2 which this
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
amendment and this U this biller
 
01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
directed to which is specifically
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
establishes the um the immigration and
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
naturalization uh test as being a
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement and um very
 
01:47:40.510 --> 01:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
similar I mean we're going to we're
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about whether or not
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
the FAFSA should be a graduation
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
requirement but uh but at least we have
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
data that that points to the fact that
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
when students complete the FAFSA they
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
have a better understanding of personal
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
financial literacy and actually a better
 
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
understanding as to whether or not they
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
can afford to go to to college um I
 
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
agree with representative lad I think
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
what's what's laid out in Roman 2 um in
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
the statute now and certainly the
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
subject of this bill has absolutely no
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
bearing on um on what a student um
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
learns from their um their their Civics
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
instruction and um and I agree with what
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock said that that it
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
could be taken out so would given the
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
fact that we're now in a in a situation
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
where we're looking to exempt students
 
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
from from the test why wouldn't we uh we
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
we just get rid of the test and rely
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
back on the um the the really the core
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
content that's laid out in
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
18911 uh as far as a strong Civics
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
education and would would would this
 
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee be interested in taking a look
 
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
at had an amendment that repeals Roman 2
 
01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:55.719 align:start position:0%
so that's the qu a question that I'm
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
putting out there uh personally I I
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
would not uh but you're okay
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
exempting different different groups
 
01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.310 align:start position:0%
exempting different different groups
represent

01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you I fully support an
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
remove the examination
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
requirement I've had multiple
 
01:49:18.270 --> 01:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
conversations in my district about the
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
barriers to doing that
 
01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
and I would parenthetically add if we're
 
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
not going to do that all of us sitting
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
in this room should have to pass that
 
01:49:29.470 --> 01:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
test U any
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
further uh comments we have a uh I I I
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
have one last comment representative L
 
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
the the Civics curriculum that we speak
 
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
to the Civics requirement to teach a
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
half year in the middle school and a
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
half year in high school and then have
 
01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
it taught embedded in the Elementary
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
grades that's that area of of the
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
academic standards now this citizenship
 
01:49:55.950 --> 01:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
test is not an
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
assessment of that K through 12
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
framework and we're trying to put the
 
01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:06.199 align:start position:0%
Frameworks back together and get in that
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
direction this assessment is a different
 
01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
assessment I don't see this as an
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
assessment of how the kids are learning
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of civics and government and
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
history it's not it's absolutely not
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
all this is is an ex exemption from this
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
test which these students which are in
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
the rzi program
 
01:50:34.109 --> 01:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
possess what we want them to know and be
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
able to do you don't know by taking this
 
01:50:40.589 --> 01:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
test by by taking the assessment up top
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
that the kids are going to do this but
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
you know that the kids are doing in
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
Razzi do do
 
01:50:48.069 --> 01:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
it that's the
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
difference and so if you truly want to
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
know if these students are functional as
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
citizens of our country I would look to
 
01:50:59.310 --> 01:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
these youngsters that students that are
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
in in in this jrc program as that's one
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
way of doing it everybody has the option
 
01:51:06.669 --> 01:51:06.679 align:start position:0%
of taking this elective course that they
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
so want to I would take it because I
 
01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot to be learned in
 
01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
leadership and and Etc within and being
 
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
a citizen in our country so I don't want
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
to construe that the assessment up top
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
is a measure of our social studies it is
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
not has not been aligned with the
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
academic standards at
 
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
all and this right here so you know I I
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
think that students that take the
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do this this is an
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
incentive for them to get into this
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
JROTC program if it's available in their
 
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
High School I think it's a
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful uh position to be in so I I I
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
just want to make that clarifying
 
01:51:51.149 --> 01:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
definition that there's a difference
 
01:51:54.189 --> 01:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
between this imigra immigration
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
test and thinking we're assessing
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum we're
 
01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
not uh representative
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
cascaden uh thank you I would support a
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
repeal of this bill because when it
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
first came out it was another
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
legislative unfunded mandate as there
 
01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:12.189 align:start position:0%
legislative unfunded mandate as there
are

01:52:12.189 --> 01:52:12.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
many and I think you need to trust the
 
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
system that they are teaching um Civics
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
in school
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
and this test does not really measure as
 
01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
somebody said the curriculum in the
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
building so I would support repealing
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
this bill there there is a motion of
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
otpa on the floor already I won't uh any
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
further comments on
 
01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
otpa represent mil and just a final
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
comment it would seem to me that that
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
this the passage of this would be an
 
01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:44.990 align:start position:0%
this the passage of this would be an
ideal

01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
ideal
 
01:52:47.709 --> 01:52:47.719 align:start position:0%
recruitment incentive for
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
Ry right sure okay all right not just
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
not just that but you know for a person
 
01:52:57.390 --> 01:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
who wants to acquire these citizenship
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
skills this is a good place to learn
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
though any further representative
 
01:53:07.390 --> 01:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
Lun so so if I'm thank you Mr chair so
 
01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
if I'm connecting the dots here that the
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
um that the um immigration
 
01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
Naturalization test is not a Civics not
 
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
not an assessment of a student civics or
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
or government understanding and it's
 
01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
not connected to any Frameworks any
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks that are that are
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
laid out in um uh in
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
statute and that
 
01:53:39.870 --> 01:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
where its
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
purpose through this amendment would be
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
to provide an
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
Rozi

01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
Rozi
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
then is it reasonable then to conclude
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
that that this um this test under Roman
 
01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:03.639 align:start position:0%
2 this the immigration Naturalization
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
test is just a hurdle or it's an or an
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
obstacle it's an obstacle to graduation
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's to be avoided at any cost if if I
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
can join another student group that may
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
become on this list of Exempted groups
 
01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm encouraged to join that student
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
group so that I don't have to take this
 
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
test it really begs the question what's
 
01:54:29.790 --> 01:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the test and um and if
 
01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
there's no purpose of the test if it is
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
not connected to um to the the the the
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
subst of content that we lay out in
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
18911 for a for for an adequate uh
 
01:54:46.109 --> 01:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
Civics education and it's not tied with
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
any of the Frameworks and it's uh uh it
 
01:54:51.870 --> 01:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to have any purpose at
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
all and and it would seem to me to make
 
01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
that it would make a lot of sense to
 
01:54:58.109 --> 01:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
rather than overburdening our public
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
schools with useless um U graduation
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
requirements I know we're going to be
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
talking about FAFSA later and I I think
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
FAFSA is a strong graduation requirement
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
for personality but this one appears to
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
be a useless graduation requirement that
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh that we should seriously consider
 
01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
consider um uh removing uh all of Roman
 
01:55:20.669 --> 01:55:20.679 align:start position:0%
2 from the statute um the uh
 
01:55:20.679 --> 01:55:21.790 align:start position:0%
2 from the statute um the uh
representative

01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you I take objection to
 
01:55:29.069 --> 01:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
the claims that this test is useless
 
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
When you mention the RSA of the Civics
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
requirements in
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
schools you speak as if this has been in
 
01:55:39.069 --> 01:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
statute for ages when this committee
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
passed the Civics
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
legislation last year so in the sense we
 
01:55:47.229 --> 01:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
have not had a time to see the impacts
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
on it and to study if the impact of
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
requiring the half credit course has
 
01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
been impactful so for some students this
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
may be the only exposure they have to
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
the Civics course we have had testimony
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
prior that stated that although it's a
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
high stakes test that there has not been
 
01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
students that we know of have been
 
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:11.800 align:start position:0%
barred from graduation for not
 
01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
completing or not passing this test so I
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
still think there is some value to the
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
test in itself I wouldn't say it's
 
01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.510 align:start position:0%
test in itself I wouldn't say it's
useless

01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
useless
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
whatsoever thank you very much uh seeing
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
no further comments let's um move on uh
 
01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
is this this is on the amend this is on
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
otpa correct let's stick to otpa
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
representative Hall sure thank you thank
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I have to say that my
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
first read of this bill it immediately
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
said to me these kids they're in a great
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
program I don't question that at all but
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
these kids probably wouldn't be able to
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
pass the test that's what it looks like
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
to me like why we're exempting them
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
because they can't sit for however long
 
01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
it takes to take an hour I don't know
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
how long it takes to take the test but
 
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
it really suggests that we want to
 
01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
exempt them so they don't have to take
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
the test and if they don't have to take
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
the test is because it's going to impact
 
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
a graduation I don't know it just
 
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
reads like it reads like we got to get
 
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
them out of that test and this is one
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
way to get it and like I say the program
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
is fantastic but um thank you
 
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:16.520 align:start position:0%

Cornell

Cornell

Thank uh is there any discussion on the

03:02:44.349 --> 03:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
yes the objection that people keep
 
03:02:49.269 --> 03:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
objecting to is part Roman numeral 5
 
03:02:51.309 --> 03:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
which is lines 25 and
 
03:02:56.190 --> 03:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
26 the uh code of conduct part of it and
 
03:02:58.269 --> 03:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
I did an amendment that completely takes
 
03:03:01.790 --> 03:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
that out but of course if we itl then I
 
03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
can't introduce the
 
03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
amendment Is there further discussion on
 
03:03:09.229 --> 03:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
the bill yes represent Cornell I would
 
03:03:10.710 --> 03:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
just like to be on the record to say
 
03:03:12.670 --> 03:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
that it's not just section five that I
 
03:03:16.990 --> 03:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:18.910 --> 03:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill represent
 
03:03:21.070 --> 03:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
cordal and I would just be go on the
 
03:03:22.910 --> 03:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
record of saying I'm going to um vote
 
03:03:25.269 --> 03:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
against itl because I see this is a very
 
03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
big problem from my years of teaching
 
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I um I remember um a former student
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
of mine meeting her later she was
 
03:03:37.870 --> 03:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
running for a political office and I was
 
03:03:39.269 --> 03:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
helping her with her campaign and she
 
03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
was extremely surprised because um she
 
03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
thought I was of the other party and
 
03:03:45.950 --> 03:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that just based on
 
03:03:46.950 --> 03:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that I was an English teacher
 
03:03:48.550 --> 03:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
in a college so I'm not going to say
 
03:03:50.269 --> 03:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
which party or anything you can kind of
 
03:03:53.269 --> 03:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
guess for yourself but um what I said to
 
03:03:57.349 --> 03:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
her was um you know I I I I didn't think
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
it was appropriate to have my any of my
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
political views obvious in class and I
 
03:04:05.349 --> 03:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
always strove to avoid doing that and I
 
03:04:08.910 --> 03:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
see this as a bill that just would make
 
03:04:10.830 --> 03:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
that something that should be done by
 
03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:11.590 align:start position:0%
that something that should be done by
all

03:04:11.590 --> 03:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:04:14.910 --> 03:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
teachers so um
 
03:04:16.750 --> 03:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
I am just wanted to explain why I was
 
03:04:18.269 --> 03:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
Voting against
 
03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
itl further
 
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
discussion just want to express my
 
03:04:28.269 --> 03:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
concern in the words Theory and ideology
 
03:04:32.590 --> 03:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
a very uh one man's theory is not not
 
03:04:36.269 --> 03:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
another and based upon what um I I think
 
03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
that this is not has not clarified some
 
03:04:41.349 --> 03:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the terminology used in there which
 
03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
makes it sort of ambiguous to me and I
 
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
think it's going to cause problems uh
 
03:04:49.030 --> 03:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
within within teaching in
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
schools uh so for that
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
reason the code is out that's good but
 
03:05:04.830 --> 03:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:08.349 --> 03:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:12.269 --> 03:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
discussion representa Tanner thank you I
 
03:05:14.229 --> 03:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
think that uh not only is it a vaguely
 
03:05:17.469 --> 03:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
worded build but um we haven't had any
 
03:05:20.229 --> 03:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
problem demonstrated here and so what it
 
03:05:22.389 --> 03:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
event what it really does is it puts it
 
03:05:25.630 --> 03:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
out there is that the default is that
 
03:05:27.710 --> 03:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
teachers are indoctrinating and that's
 
03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
so grossly wrong that um it's hard to
 
03:05:33.070 --> 03:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
imagine and it becomes an insulting bill
 
03:05:35.950 --> 03:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
for teachers so I agree with um
 
03:05:37.710 --> 03:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell I object to
 
03:05:40.389 --> 03:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
everything in it thank you further
 
03:05:42.630 --> 03:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
discussion are you ready to call Ro mam
 
03:05:42.640 --> 03:05:44.429 align:start position:0%
discussion are you ready to call Ro mam

more I think there's probably ext's
 
03:09:11.910 --> 03:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
going that way
 
03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:22.190 align:start position:0%
going that way
then

03:09:22.190 --> 03:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%

0322 and explain uh what we've done here
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh you can see the highlighted areas
 
03:09:38.269 --> 03:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about an owner's
 
03:09:40.710 --> 03:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
project manager this is you remember
 
03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
this is the language that came from the
 
03:09:44.070 --> 03:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
03:09:47.070 --> 03:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
and um so the person that's acting like
 
03:09:49.790 --> 03:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
a clerk of the works has to be the
 
03:09:53.229 --> 03:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
owner's person not the contractor's
 
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
person which is very very dangerous when
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
it comes to change orders which are
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
expensive then we go down to the public
 
03:10:04.710 --> 03:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure area and where we
 
03:10:06.190 --> 03:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
have put in there the general court
 
03:10:07.870 --> 03:10:07.880 align:start position:0%

03:10:09.630 --> 03:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
provide funding for infrastructure
 
03:10:11.469 --> 03:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
projects for public
 
03:10:15.309 --> 03:10:15.319 align:start position:0%

03:10:27.990 --> 03:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
right no it's not what we sent over if
 
03:10:34.910 --> 03:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
it said uh Public elementary and public
 
03:10:34.920 --> 03:10:36.670 align:start position:0%

03:10:41.429 --> 03:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
projects for public preschools okay the
 
03:10:44.070 --> 03:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
commas are there okay thank goodness for
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
that and then going on to the back page
 
03:10:48.790 --> 03:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
there on Roman
 
03:10:48.800 --> 03:10:50.790 align:start position:0%
there on Roman
three

03:10:50.790 --> 03:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:10:50.800 --> 03:10:54.190 align:start position:0%
three
uh

03:10:54.190 --> 03:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:57.269 --> 03:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
the um May authorize the department to
 
03:10:57.279 --> 03:10:59.590 align:start position:0%
the um May authorize the department to
fund

03:10:59.590 --> 03:10:59.600 align:start position:0%

03:11:04.309 --> 03:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:06.950 --> 03:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
purposes uh the public school
 
03:11:11.389 --> 03:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure commission may yeah okay
 
03:11:13.990 --> 03:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
um and then underneath that they they're
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
changing the date um and they struck out
 
03:11:22.229 --> 03:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
remember in Roman 4 where we had struck
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
out in the first time the first meeting
 
03:11:25.910 --> 03:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the commission shall be called by the
 
03:11:29.590 --> 03:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
first named House member that's back in
 
03:11:30.910 --> 03:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
the first meeting of the commission
 
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
shall be held within 45 days of
 
03:11:34.349 --> 03:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
effective date of the section that's
 
03:11:36.469 --> 03:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
back in the commission shall meet at
 
03:11:38.469 --> 03:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
least monthly that's out because the
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
commission does not meet monthly and
 
03:11:43.110 --> 03:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
cannot meet monthly then I believe there
 
03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
is on the bottom in line 18 a
 
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation that came I think that
 
03:11:48.070 --> 03:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
came from representa
 
03:11:50.750 --> 03:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
Damon the Department of Education shall
 
03:11:52.349 --> 03:11:52.359 align:start position:0%
notify every Public School in New
 
03:11:54.070 --> 03:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how to access the United
 
03:11:55.630 --> 03:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
States Environmental Protection Agency
 
03:11:58.389 --> 03:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
Tools for Schools program and shall
 
03:12:00.030 --> 03:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
encourage public schools to implement
 
03:12:01.870 --> 03:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
and uh the program to help provide and
 
03:12:04.030 --> 03:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
maintain good indoor air quality in
 
03:12:06.309 --> 03:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
public school buildings so those are
 
03:12:07.870 --> 03:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
changed I think those changes come
 
03:12:11.550 --> 03:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%

have anything to add as the second or
other

03:12:25.550 --> 03:12:25.560 align:start position:0%

03:12:37.910 --> 03:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
and 28 Rick the the reference to 2016
 
03:12:41.349 --> 03:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
2017 on the front
 
03:12:45.670 --> 03:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
page yeah is that is that
 
03:12:47.630 --> 03:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
accurate that's when it
 
03:12:50.510 --> 03:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
started okay
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
um that stuff's probably pass probably
 
03:12:55.830 --> 03:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
could get knocked out but it's it's what
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
we had in the bill initially when we put
 
03:13:03.229 --> 03:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure group together um so
 
03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
I follow so yes I agree with youi but if
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
this if this passes like that is that
 
03:13:10.870 --> 03:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to then cease uh terminate the
 
03:13:13.229 --> 03:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
bill when it gets there they're going to
 
03:13:16.910 --> 03:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
say it's that budget's gone
 
03:13:20.510 --> 03:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
by you know what I mean all right yeah
 
03:13:22.670 --> 03:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's current statute I
 
03:13:24.550 --> 03:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
believe so it hasn't been current
 
03:13:27.990 --> 03:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
statute it hasn't been a problem since
 
03:13:30.349 --> 03:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
2017 we appropriated 10 million this
 
03:13:33.229 --> 03:13:33.239 align:start position:0%

41570 Amendment
 
03:17:28.359 --> 03:17:30.590 align:start position:0%
41570 Amendment
0336

03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
0336
 
03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
H as an amendment to the
 
03:17:37.790 --> 03:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
bill second to the amendment represent
 
03:17:40.349 --> 03:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
Miler okay I'd like to explain this
 
03:17:41.790 --> 03:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
because it's coming at everybody pretty
 
03:17:41.800 --> 03:17:42.830 align:start position:0%
because it's coming at everybody pretty
quickly

03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
03:17:45.550 --> 03:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
as you may recall the bill 1570 it's an
 
03:17:48.189 --> 03:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
early bill but if you can remember that
 
03:17:48.199 --> 03:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
early bill but if you can remember that
this

03:17:49.510 --> 03:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:17:54.110 --> 03:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
bill put in $70 million into the educ
 
03:17:56.950 --> 03:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund into a
 
03:18:00.670 --> 03:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
school building Aid fund within that
 
03:18:03.429 --> 03:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
fund and there is also stipulations of
 
03:18:06.189 --> 03:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
how future monies would be put in a
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of the Surplus
 
03:18:14.750 --> 03:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
80% which is huge amount and there was a
 
03:18:17.469 --> 03:18:17.479 align:start position:0%
percentage set aside for
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
administration and when I looked at it
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
really carefully there were a lot of
 
03:18:24.590 --> 03:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
areas that was just not it's it's it's a
 
03:18:28.870 --> 03:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
good idea but it's not ready but at the
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
latter part of this bill there is a
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill which we have talked
 
03:18:35.790 --> 03:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
about for years and that is doing a
 
03:18:38.910 --> 03:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
survey of the schools which are out in
 
03:18:42.750 --> 03:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
the state in terms of
 
03:18:46.309 --> 03:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
that we can put the 10-year plan that we
 
03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
encourage districts to do to really be
 
03:18:51.870 --> 03:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
able to do it based upon prioritization
 
03:18:55.070 --> 03:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
and have folks that are coming out a
 
03:18:57.389 --> 03:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
contracted service that would come out
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
or a person a group that a vendor to
 
03:19:02.309 --> 03:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
conduct a facility assessment of all the
 
03:19:04.150 --> 03:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
schools or the schools which we need to
 
03:19:08.030 --> 03:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
do it on and that would be done by the
 
03:19:10.590 --> 03:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
same criteria for all schools not
 
03:19:12.070 --> 03:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily the custodian or the
 
03:19:13.870 --> 03:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance person doing that assessment
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
and sending that report into doe what
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to do it's going to better
 
03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
provide us an awareness of what we have
 
03:19:21.790 --> 03:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
to appropriate for uh building Aid in
 
03:19:24.790 --> 03:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
many cases it's um also going to help
 
03:19:28.469 --> 03:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
schools out uh in terms of knowing what
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with um we've also been
 
03:19:36.429 --> 03:19:36.439 align:start position:0%
told that that the cost we have 33
 
03:19:40.590 --> 03:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
million square ft of facilities in the
 
03:19:43.269 --> 03:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
state and it was C somewhere between 5
 
03:19:45.429 --> 03:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
cents and 10 cents or 15 cents per
 
03:19:48.269 --> 03:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
square foot taking 10 cents if you take
 
03:19:51.030 --> 03:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
the 33 million it's about square feet is
 
03:19:53.590 --> 03:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
$3.3 million I think that's my math
 
03:19:56.269 --> 03:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
right um and that's what would have to
 
03:19:58.630 --> 03:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
be appropriated for this um it's
 
03:20:00.189 --> 03:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
something that we have tried to do I
 
03:20:03.269 --> 03:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
know that there's um uh a certain
 
03:20:05.469 --> 03:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
representative from Bo that tried this
 
03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
I've tried this numerous people on both
 
03:20:10.590 --> 03:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
sides have tried to get this done so we
 
03:20:12.110 --> 03:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
can more accurately know what's out
 
03:20:14.590 --> 03:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
there and so we can project and and and
 
03:20:18.349 --> 03:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
project uh budgets that reflect need so
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
what I've done I've I've I've left in
 
03:20:22.349 --> 03:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
exactly the wording which was in that
 
03:20:25.910 --> 03:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill with Part B there which is in bold
 
03:20:27.790 --> 03:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
that was in the bill everything in part
 
03:20:31.269 --> 03:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
A was already in the ball rule stat it's
 
03:20:33.910 --> 03:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
already statute so what we're doing is
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
just looking at that last part there's
 
03:20:38.469 --> 03:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
one two three four five lines which
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
would be added to this thank you
 
03:20:44.910 --> 03:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh further comment yeah I I would just
 
03:20:47.389 --> 03:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh reiterate what uh chairman lad said
 
03:20:50.110 --> 03:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
that we've been waiting for a long time
 
03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
to do this kind of an assessment we've
 
03:20:54.630 --> 03:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
talked about it for several years so uh
 
03:20:56.349 --> 03:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
this would basically put this into
 
03:20:58.630 --> 03:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
operation thank
 
03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
you any other committee
 
03:21:03.510 --> 03:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
members representative
 
03:21:07.750 --> 03:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
lakas okay so it says all after the
 
03:21:11.389 --> 03:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
enacting Clause so we're getting rid of
 
03:21:14.070 --> 03:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
the bill Aid fund created and
 
03:21:17.469 --> 03:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
invested and all of that that correct
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay and then my other
 
03:21:25.550 --> 03:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
question is in the original bill it had
 
03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
how the Contracting cost were to be paid
 
03:21:31.229 --> 03:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
it's not in
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
here is that intentional as well it's
 
03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
intentional see the State Board of
 
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
Education shall adopt Rules pursuant to
 
03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
This paragraph above and I'll figure it
 
03:21:44.710 --> 03:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
as that that's exactly right okay thank
 
03:21:44.720 --> 03:21:46.550 align:start position:0%
as that that's exactly right okay thank
you

03:21:46.550 --> 03:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:21:50.389 --> 03:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
yeah any further comments from the
 
03:21:53.429 --> 03:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative Heath um
 
03:21:56.550 --> 03:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
question for you Mr chair um why
 
03:21:58.389 --> 03:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't we consider the education trust
 
03:21:58.399 --> 03:22:00.469 align:start position:0%
couldn't we consider the education trust
for

03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%

OTP represent dry yes just want to say
 
03:26:05.550 --> 03:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
that we did a lot of research on this

03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
aspects that uh people hire up the chain

we're talking about including training
 
03:26:19.830 --> 03:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
storage of pens um and dosage and found
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
that all of those concerns were already
 
03:26:24.870 --> 03:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
addressed in the um different sections
 
03:26:27.150 --> 03:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the chapter that we're including this
 
03:26:29.990 --> 03:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
into so that um basically we've met
 
03:26:32.070 --> 03:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's concerns it's already a
 
03:26:33.950 --> 03:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
practice that's going around around the
 
03:26:37.870 --> 03:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:41.229 --> 03:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
idea further discussion from the second
 
03:26:43.950 --> 03:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I think this is such a um
 
03:26:45.189 --> 03:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
important bill because it's a
 
03:26:48.070 --> 03:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
life-saving bill uh that has to have you
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%

Bela yes thank you uh just one moment so
 
03:29:26.510 --> 03:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:26.520 --> 03:29:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
here

03:29:29.630 --> 03:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:33.510 --> 03:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
Bill oh yes excellent um so I I'm making
 
03:29:35.710 --> 03:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
this motion on my own bill because after
 
03:29:38.110 --> 03:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
Consulting and doing research I have
 
03:29:40.670 --> 03:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
found that the demand for an uptime of
 
03:29:44.870 --> 03:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
$99 % on a website uh is likely outside
 
03:29:46.510 --> 03:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
of the University's control and is not a
 
03:29:49.070 --> 03:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
recognized industry standard um I'm
 
03:29:50.830 --> 03:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
deadly serious about reform but I'm also
 
03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
deadly serious about bringing a bill
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
that I believe Will Survive a court
 
03:29:56.030 --> 03:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
challenge if it so happens and as
 
03:29:58.229 --> 03:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
written right now I don't think this
 
03:29:59.750 --> 03:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill is workable or would survive a
 
03:30:01.269 --> 03:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
court challenge so I move
 
03:30:03.630 --> 03:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
it from the
 
03:30:08.269 --> 03:30:08.279 align:start position:0%

the

03:37:01.750 --> 03:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
itl sure um thank you Mr chair so
 
03:37:06.910 --> 03:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the the um the bill only has
 
03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
a few lines in it but it does add to a
 
03:37:10.239 --> 03:37:12.990 align:start position:0%
a few lines in it but it does add to a
um

03:37:12.990 --> 03:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:16.229 --> 03:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
a sometimes use section of law where
 
03:37:19.870 --> 03:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
school boards May seek to hold a special
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
meeting uh for changes in school funding
 
03:37:25.950 --> 03:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of um uh situations I
 
03:37:28.469 --> 03:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
think that can that can trip into this
 
03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
like um like if a if a if on the floor
 
03:37:35.189 --> 03:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
of a school meeting it increases the
 
03:37:37.229 --> 03:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
authorization beyond what a budget
 
03:37:40.110 --> 03:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
committee does by 10% I think that may
 
03:37:41.950 --> 03:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
be one of these conditions but this is a
 
03:37:45.309 --> 03:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
new condition that's being added and and
 
03:37:47.389 --> 03:37:47.399 align:start position:0%
honestly it's not clear because it looks
 
03:37:50.070 --> 03:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
like the difference between the the
 
03:37:52.750 --> 03:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
October Grant estimate and the final
 
03:37:59.830 --> 03:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:02.630 --> 03:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
um and and I think we need to we need to
 
03:38:04.150 --> 03:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
make sure we know exactly what we're
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
getting ourselves into when um when
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
requiring a a school board to uh to have
 
03:38:15.670 --> 03:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
to um uh seek an order for a special
 
03:38:18.030 --> 03:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
meeting would it not be better then that
 
03:38:19.950 --> 03:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
we were go looking at inter room study
 
03:38:22.510 --> 03:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
to ascertain whether this is you know
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
how it would take place and how it be
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
done I'd be okay with
 
03:38:29.790 --> 03:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
that so would uh you be willing to take
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
back the itl I would I would pull back
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
my um my itl motion and replace and and
 
03:38:39.150 --> 03:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
put the inter study and replace that
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
with an interim study
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay so we had we're the other motions
 
03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%

03:40:15.309 --> 03:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
gotten the out the lunch award on that
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill if we'd gone the other way I'm sure
 
03:40:20.670 --> 03:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
was there much testimony on that bill I
 
03:40:23.070 --> 03:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't here that Day represent fellows
 
03:40:23.080 --> 03:40:24.510 align:start position:0%

03:40:49.710 --> 03:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:52.269 --> 03:40:52.279 align:start position:0%
um now how about we take about a five or
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
10 minute break right now

break I got to catch up I I need to
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
write down so we can get that in the
 
03:41:12.910 --> 03:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
over here what we accomplished before we
 
03:41:15.550 --> 03:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
get to buried so in the order what we
 
03:41:17.309 --> 03:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
did this
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon so it's in sending order so
 
03:41:20.910 --> 03:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
that was the last
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
one okay let me put okay the first one
 
03:41:29.149 --> 03:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:33.790 --> 03:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
1555 okay good yeah okay then we 1436
 
03:41:37.070 --> 03:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:37.080 --> 03:41:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:40.830 align:start position:0%
okay
10888

03:41:40.830 --> 03:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
10888
 
03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:42.189 align:start position:0%
10888
yeah

03:41:42.189 --> 03:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:41:42.199 --> 03:41:45.950 align:start position:0%
yeah
1570

03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:45.960 --> 03:42:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
1570

03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.960 --> 03:44:39.349 align:start position:0%
 
1165

03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
but as as a reminder if you made a
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
motion you know like the primary motion
 
03:44:49.510 --> 03:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
and and if you were a minority we have
 
03:44:52.349 --> 03:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
to have the blurbs done right
 
03:44:56.510 --> 03:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
off um so if if we have a break here I
 
03:44:57.910 --> 03:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
would suggest that some of you start
 
03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
working on that um because we can't we
 
03:45:02.550 --> 03:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
can't wait and wait and wait because
 
03:45:03.830 --> 03:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to be piling a whole lot of
 
03:45:05.590 --> 03:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
new bills on tomorrow too and it's just
 
03:45:07.750 --> 03:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
going to start compiling it's hard to
 
03:45:10.349 --> 03:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
keep track and that is something that
 
03:45:12.110 --> 03:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
every committee is being asked to do is
 
03:45:14.349 --> 03:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
get the committee reports done on the
 
03:45:16.229 --> 03:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
day before you
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
leave so something you might be wanting
 
03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:34.960 --> 03:45:37.590 align:start position:0%
 
about

03:45:37.590 --> 03:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
session yeah we're probably going to
 
03:45:42.510 --> 03:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee working on the two
 
03:45:45.870 --> 03:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
College Bills or the due process we
 
03:45:47.229 --> 03:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
haven't set it up yet that was going to
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
go in or no we can't do it because no
 
03:45:53.070 --> 03:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
that's this Thursday no so no on
 
03:45:55.149 --> 03:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
Thursday we won't have
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:02.349 --> 03:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
forget yeah want autopilot you know so
 
03:46:03.710 --> 03:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'll be working on things tonight for
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
yep on consent is that a majority
 
03:46:14.309 --> 03:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
report if it's on consent there's on
 
03:46:17.229 --> 03:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
it's a committee report yeah see I don't
 
03:46:19.349 --> 03:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
like that form yeah because there's all
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of technical stuff that's wrong
 
03:46:22.710 --> 03:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
with it too you you go to type down here
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
and the lines keep going down and you
 
03:46:29.429 --> 03:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
they are writing okay Long Easy except
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
for C's fine yeah that's what they're
 
03:46:34.030 --> 03:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
going get the other one that I did um
 
03:46:36.590 --> 03:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
Miler did went to arm study and it was
 
03:46:39.269 --> 03:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
20 to zero was the final thing so he
 
03:46:41.149 --> 03:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
writes that's exactly right and I don't
 
03:46:42.910 --> 03:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
have to do anything because it was 20
 
03:46:45.149 --> 03:46:45.159 align:start position:0%
nothing it was 20 nothing yet there's
 
03:46:47.189 --> 03:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
only one report that's the committee
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
report which now we'll do because it's
 
03:47:07.389 --> 03:47:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.229 --> 03:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:27.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:47:27.790 --> 03:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:30.269 align:start position:0%
 
Will

03:47:30.269 --> 03:47:30.279 align:start position:0%

right

03:54:07.389 --> 03:54:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:25.349 --> 03:54:25.359 align:start position:0%

and then we're not going to take any
 
03:54:36.510 --> 03:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:42.750 --> 03:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
it okay this is relative to the
 
03:55:01.269 --> 03:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement of filing a free
 
03:55:03.469 --> 03:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
application for federal student aid
 
03:55:06.590 --> 03:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
called FAFSA and with that I'd like to
 
03:55:09.990 --> 03:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
recognize representa Noble
 
03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
I move a to pass on HB
 
03:55:16.269 --> 03:55:16.279 align:start position:0%
1066 like second so we have a motion
 
03:55:19.790 --> 03:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
made by representative Noble OTP and
 
03:55:30.630 --> 03:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.840 --> 03:55:37.790 align:start position:0%
 
don't

03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:42.630 align:start position:0%
don't
right

03:55:42.630 --> 03:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:45.630 --> 03:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Noble you're
 
03:55:49.630 --> 03:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair um I know
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
that the current law is important to
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
some of us but in practice I think that
 
03:55:59.110 --> 03:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
the Schoolboard policy makes a lot more
 
03:56:01.950 --> 03:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
sense for our districts and for
 
03:56:05.830 --> 03:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
parents um like I said in the hearing I
 
03:56:08.349 --> 03:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
had at least in my district um parents
 
03:56:08.359 --> 03:56:09.550 align:start position:0%
had at least in my district um parents
were

03:56:09.550 --> 03:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:56:13.550 --> 03:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
very United um behind this bill which is
 
03:56:18.670 --> 03:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
super unusual in these times
 
03:56:23.550 --> 03:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
um the nhsaa supports this bill the nhba
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
supports this bill and I hope you all
 
03:56:29.189 --> 03:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
will as
 
03:56:35.309 --> 03:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
Damon I am supporting this bill uh
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
because the superintendent in my
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
district found it challenging to follow
 
03:56:54.790 --> 03:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:57.309 --> 03:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
happen yes there any further discussion
 
03:56:58.870 --> 03:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee represent
 
03:57:02.670 --> 03:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chair I understand
 
03:57:06.030 --> 03:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
the some we just have started this
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
program and I understand from the
 
03:57:10.670 --> 03:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
feedback that we've gotten that it has
 
03:57:13.389 --> 03:57:13.399 align:start position:0%
been difficult for some school
 
03:57:16.910 --> 03:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
districts to get the information from
 
03:57:19.950 --> 03:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
students but I don't want us to forget
 
03:57:22.349 --> 03:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
the original intent of this
 
03:57:25.110 --> 03:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill the original intent of this bill
 
03:57:29.389 --> 03:57:29.399 align:start position:0%
was to have students fill out the FY
 
03:57:33.429 --> 03:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
form and as a result of that begin to
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that perhaps those who didn't
 
03:57:38.990 --> 03:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
think they could go to college or go to
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
further their education either in
 
03:57:44.309 --> 03:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
college or community colleges or in a a
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
skill trade
 
03:57:48.469 --> 03:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
program and that was the intent of it I
 
03:57:50.429 --> 03:57:50.439 align:start position:0%
mean we didn't I don't think the
 
03:57:52.510 --> 03:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
original intent was to provide an
 
03:57:56.469 --> 03:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
onerous experience for parents Etc and
 
03:57:59.710 --> 03:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to be voting against the
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
OTP um
 
03:58:05.630 --> 03:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
not in non- recognizing the problems but
 
03:58:09.269 --> 03:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
in the spirit of the originally bill as
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
it was passed thank you further
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:18.590 --> 03:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
Ford I admit that the original intent
 
03:58:20.510 --> 03:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
was it just
 
03:58:25.070 --> 03:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
described but I would also say that what
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
the bill is now addressing is the need
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
for all students to assess the financial
 
03:58:35.469 --> 03:58:35.479 align:start position:0%
ability of continuing their education
 
03:58:38.670 --> 03:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's now being required for programs of
 
03:58:41.070 --> 03:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
studies in the industrial
 
03:58:44.269 --> 03:58:44.279 align:start position:0%
Arts Plumbing Heating all those kinds of
 
03:58:47.590 --> 03:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
things there are uh programs affiliated
 
03:58:50.910 --> 03:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
with institutions that require the FAFSA
 
03:58:54.790 --> 03:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
you cannot apply from for some state aid
 
03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
without fulfilling this FAFSA and so
 
03:58:58.110 --> 03:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
03:59:00.429 --> 03:59:00.439 align:start position:0%
even they can't say it's just for
 
03:59:02.990 --> 03:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
college it's not just for college it's
 
03:59:05.630 --> 03:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
for the craft for the Arts for a lot of
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
things and so a student doesn't have any
 
03:59:12.469 --> 03:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
real comprehension of what they're going
 
03:59:15.389 --> 03:59:15.399 align:start position:0%
to need if they choose to pursue
 
03:59:17.710 --> 03:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
additional study After High
 
03:59:20.269 --> 03:59:20.279 align:start position:0%
School and I think that's what the fafta
 
03:59:23.149 --> 03:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
does it lets them understand how you can
 
03:59:25.870 --> 03:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
do it who's going to fund it and there
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
are lots of different sources of funding
 
03:59:30.389 --> 03:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
I was astounded quite frankly when I
 
03:59:33.550 --> 03:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
would began exploring this and there's a
 
03:59:35.950 --> 03:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
lot of money out there for people who
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
want to pursue things other than College
 
03:59:42.189 --> 03:59:42.199 align:start position:0%
so I would be in favor of this
 
03:59:45.229 --> 03:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
bill further discussion on the bill
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner thank you and I
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
totally agree with everything
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Ford has has mentioned um
 
03:59:55.590 --> 03:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
I too am concerned uh that you know that
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
students don't always understand the
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
total Financial packages that may be out
 
04:00:02.870 --> 04:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
there for them and that many of them
 
04:00:04.830 --> 04:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
just kind of right off College I you
 
04:00:07.149 --> 04:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
know when you talk to them uh and fapa
 
04:00:08.870 --> 04:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
filling out a fapa form
 
04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
helps I on the other hand I will be
 
04:00:14.550 --> 04:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
voting for this bill because I've also
 
04:00:16.590 --> 04:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
talked to school administrators who feel
 
04:00:21.030 --> 04:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
that that the barrier of graduation for
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
not filling out the form and the fact
 
04:00:24.990 --> 04:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
that it puts pressure on some students
 
04:00:28.070 --> 04:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
whose parents really do not want to fill
 
04:00:31.590 --> 04:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
out a Federal Form um make it very
 
04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
difficult and when the end of the school
 
04:00:35.309 --> 04:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
year comes and people are running around
 
04:00:37.750 --> 04:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get graduation together and
 
04:00:40.229 --> 04:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
who gradu grates and who doesn't and and
 
04:00:42.750 --> 04:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
all that I I don't think the filling out
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
the FAFSA form should be a check off on
 
04:00:48.110 --> 04:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
that list thank you is there further
 
04:00:48.120 --> 04:00:49.750 align:start position:0%
that list thank you is there further
discussion

04:00:49.750 --> 04:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
on on the
 
04:00:54.429 --> 04:00:54.439 align:start position:0%
bill yes representative luno very
 
04:00:56.910 --> 04:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you Mr chair so um so Mr
 
04:00:59.710 --> 04:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
chair you and I serve on the um the the
 
04:01:02.910 --> 04:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
governor's higher education or ccsnh and
 
04:01:07.469 --> 04:01:07.479 align:start position:0%
usnh task force and so uh so College um
 
04:01:09.950 --> 04:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
College Bound uh students is something
 
04:01:12.189 --> 04:01:12.199 align:start position:0%
that is very interesting to what the
 
04:01:16.110 --> 04:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
what the task force is doing I um I'm
 
04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against the um the the
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass but uh but but I think the
 
04:01:24.670 --> 04:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
the bill that's being presented here
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
while it does eliminate the um the faf
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
as a require as a graduation requirement
 
04:01:34.189 --> 04:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
has a good spirit um to it that that I
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
think in general improves the the
 
04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
financial literacy of of um of of high
 
04:01:42.630 --> 04:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
school students and gives them a better
 
04:01:44.590 --> 04:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of what of how they can
 
04:01:46.790 --> 04:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
afford College than maybe they had in
 
04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
the past but but really I just want to
 
04:01:51.429 --> 04:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
sort of leave everybody with uh one of
 
04:01:53.070 --> 04:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
the things that came up at the task
 
04:01:55.990 --> 04:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
force meeting on Friday last week which
 
04:01:57.950 --> 04:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
was a report prepared by the Department
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
of Education I'll see if I can find it
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and send it out that um that
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
shows the percentage of students in
 
04:02:09.389 --> 04:02:09.399 align:start position:0%
every High School that are going on to
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
four-year colleges 2-year colleges um uh
 
04:02:16.830 --> 04:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh the workplace um uh armed services uh
 
04:02:21.149 --> 04:02:21.159 align:start position:0%
or other and um and it's um it's not at
 
04:02:24.670 --> 04:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
all even close to uniform in terms of uh
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of the opportunities that um
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
that that students are choosing you're
 
04:02:31.149 --> 04:02:31.159 align:start position:0%
seeing some high schools will um you
 
04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
know uh uh
 
04:02:36.309 --> 04:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
you and I I don't remember the number
 
04:02:38.670 --> 04:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but maybe 15 % of
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
the graduating class might be might be
 
04:02:43.510 --> 04:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
going off to a to higher education
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
through a two or fouryear college well
 
04:02:47.830 --> 04:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
well in other high schools it's closer
 
04:02:47.840 --> 04:02:48.590 align:start position:0%
well in other high schools it's closer
to

04:02:48.590 --> 04:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:02:51.710 --> 04:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
90% and um and there's certainly I think
 
04:02:54.149 --> 04:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of work that that we can be doing
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
and I hope the task force will do and
 
04:02:58.550 --> 04:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
having a better understanding as to why
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
students are making these decisions
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
because they're um there're it's it's
 
04:03:06.189 --> 04:03:06.199 align:start position:0%
it's not at all that that 60% of the
 
04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
kids are going off to college
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's it it fluctuates wildly and I
 
04:03:13.670 --> 04:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
hope that's something that as a
 
04:03:16.590 --> 04:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body uh we can get a better
 
04:03:17.950 --> 04:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
better understanding of what those
 
04:03:20.189 --> 04:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
causes are making sure these kids have
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
successful livelihoods down the road
 
04:03:22.439 --> 04:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
successful livelihoods down the road
thank

04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:03:27.070 --> 04:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
you and as a member of that same group
 
04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
and as a member of the trustees um we
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
have discussed fa so quite often and we
 
04:03:34.710 --> 04:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
have like the Bia will come in and talk
 
04:03:37.110 --> 04:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
about it and others as well but we do
 
04:03:42.189 --> 04:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of the uh C some of the
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
cost is for seeing uh this varying
 
04:03:46.950 --> 04:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
number from percentages from one school
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
to another have a lot to do with uh the
 
04:03:53.110 --> 04:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
stability of the community in terms of
 
04:03:56.670 --> 04:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
wages and and and uh the ability the a
 
04:03:58.269 --> 04:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
student looks at that and of course the
 
04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
parents working there too and the
 
04:04:01.550 --> 04:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
student knows I've got to go work at
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
Walmart I got to go work at Dunkin
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
Donuts because this is I need to help
 
04:04:08.030 --> 04:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
bring some money into this family all
 
04:04:09.630 --> 04:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
also due to the nature of families
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more divorce and all out
 
04:04:12.389 --> 04:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
there now and the single family is
 
04:04:14.710 --> 04:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
trying to make it uh so it's putting
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
pressure on on students and I think it's
 
04:04:21.070 --> 04:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
also important that the FAA FAFSA be
 
04:04:23.429 --> 04:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
communicated with kids not as a
 
04:04:25.229 --> 04:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement but so they
 
04:04:27.389 --> 04:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
understand there are ways I can get
 
04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
there there's ways I can get the grant
 
04:04:30.510 --> 04:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
money for example from Plymouth State
 
04:04:33.910 --> 04:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
and Kean and new in UNH there are
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
programs Grant Awards available for
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
those students which are cannot afford
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
it and many of those students come
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
without paying tuition at all if you
 
04:04:44.950 --> 04:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
actually saw the net costs coming out
 
04:04:46.670 --> 04:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
rather than what you're we always look
 
04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
at and say oh we're the highest or the
 
04:04:50.349 --> 04:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
second highest in the country but when
 
04:04:52.349 --> 04:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
you take this bracket right here we're
 
04:04:56.149 --> 04:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
not and so I you know I I think the fafs
 
04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
is extremely important but we don't need
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
it as a graduation
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
requirement represent
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
Noble when you fill that form out you
 
04:05:09.910 --> 04:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
have to list at least one school that
 
04:05:12.790 --> 04:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
you want to send your information to so
 
04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
you have already done the research you
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
already know that you want to go to
 
04:05:19.710 --> 04:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
college at that point so it's not like
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
everybody just fill the form out and see
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
who can afford it you you already have
 
04:05:28.469 --> 04:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
that desire to go to college or whatever
 
04:05:31.389 --> 04:05:31.399 align:start position:0%
if if it's a a technical program that
 
04:05:33.389 --> 04:05:33.399 align:start position:0%
works with FAFSA so you already you
 
04:05:34.750 --> 04:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
already know what you're
 
04:05:37.590 --> 04:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
doing um in my district they've talked
 
04:05:37.600 --> 04:05:38.790 align:start position:0%
doing um in my district they've talked
about

04:05:38.790 --> 04:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:05:41.950 --> 04:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
um adding this to the personal finance
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
class so that it does get more exposure
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
on top of the information nights that
 
04:05:51.550 --> 04:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
they already do so just just another
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
thought forther yes represent
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
bony thank you um I just have one
 
04:06:01.950 --> 04:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
question I'm not objecting to the repeal
 
04:06:03.910 --> 04:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the form itself but I'm just con I
 
04:06:06.510 --> 04:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
was just wondering why at the bottom
 
04:06:10.349 --> 04:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
where you also repeal RSA 193 E3 which
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
is relative to reports on completing the
 
04:06:14.830 --> 04:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
form and when I looked that up it just
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
is asking uh that the high school or the
 
04:06:19.630 --> 04:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
schools submit the number and percentage
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
of graduating high school students
 
04:06:24.750 --> 04:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
provided inperson School assistance in
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
completing a free application for
 
04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
federal student aid that for doing that
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
form which is a voluntary thing so I'm
 
04:06:34.110 --> 04:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
just questioning why you wouldn't want
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
to report
 
04:06:36.800 --> 04:06:38.870 align:start position:0%
to report
that

04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
do anybody want to ask that question I I
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
I think that was just part of the law um
 
04:06:50.950 --> 04:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
and yeah I I don't I don't see the
 
04:06:52.510 --> 04:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
reason in keeping that there if we're
 
04:06:56.670 --> 04:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.790 --> 04:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
itself um my question is though uh don't
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
high schools voluntarily provide
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
assistance anyway um they're not
 
04:07:08.429 --> 04:07:08.439 align:start position:0%
required to but I think this um is just
 
04:07:12.349 --> 04:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
trying to get uh data on how many how
 
04:07:14.590 --> 04:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
how how many students they actually help
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
complete the form that's
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
all we do have an indicator with
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
inadequacy an indicator that we are
 
04:07:23.070 --> 04:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
delivering an adequate education that
 
04:07:27.269 --> 04:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
requires schools to submit the the kids
 
04:07:29.349 --> 04:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
which are going off to to the military
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
fafs and taking that that test those
 
04:07:33.309 --> 04:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
which are going over off to higher
 
04:07:34.910 --> 04:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
education yes that's part of one of the
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
indicators as well so doe does receive
 
04:07:37.520 --> 04:07:39.469 align:start position:0%
indicators as well so doe does receive
this

04:07:39.469 --> 04:07:39.479 align:start position:0%

indicators were required to file as a
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%

with uh pursuing uh due process on a

special education case um this is um
 
04:15:16.750 --> 04:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
occurring after uh the IEP and there are

04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
um I think from testimony we've heard

over the past several years and
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh some of the freshmen
 
04:16:04.750 --> 04:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
have missed some very uh uh important
 
04:16:07.109 --> 04:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
testimony over the past couple of terms
 
04:16:09.750 --> 04:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
from specialed parents uh trying to
 
04:16:11.550 --> 04:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
navigate through the
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
process um and coming up on
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%

through the process I I remember a a
 
04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
lawyer with a special needs child
 
04:16:28.030 --> 04:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
talking about how long she had to study
 
04:16:30.910 --> 04:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
specialed law to try and figure out what
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
she had to do to get services for her
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
child um we heard the special ed
 
04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
Advocate talk about um the um
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
unprocessed uh disputes that she was
 
04:16:51.750 --> 04:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
involved in trying to find a solution um
 
04:16:53.670 --> 04:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
and these were long-term disputes that
 
04:16:56.790 --> 04:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
hadn't been settled and who was
 
04:16:59.109 --> 04:16:59.119 align:start position:0%
suffering but the child because the
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
child was not getting the services that
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
the parent thought were was needed and
 
04:17:07.710 --> 04:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
she s has been successful in and getting
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
a number of those resolved
 
04:17:15.149 --> 04:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
thankfully um so after the
 
04:17:18.030 --> 04:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
hearing I went back to the department
 
04:17:20.750 --> 04:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
and that one sheet you have a double
 
04:17:25.510 --> 04:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
side or two-page sheet is the uh uh
 
04:17:29.670 --> 04:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
dispute resolutions and and um uh
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
indications of uh settlement
 
04:17:36.790 --> 04:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
Etc but um Steven Berwick who is the ad
 
04:17:39.630 --> 04:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
administrator for dispute resolution and
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
complaints indicated to me that since
 
04:17:44.040 --> 04:17:47.590 align:start position:0%
complaints indicated to me that since
July

04:17:47.590 --> 04:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
2021 there has been one neutral
 
04:17:52.880 --> 04:17:54.550 align:start position:0%
2021 there has been one neutral
conference

04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
conference
 
04:17:58.469 --> 04:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
one in three
 
04:18:02.349 --> 04:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
years um is this something that we have
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
to put in parents is this another step
 
04:18:07.710 --> 04:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
um that we have to tell parents that
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
they have to look into or if they want
 
04:18:12.550 --> 04:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
to take that track can't they go just
 
04:18:13.630 --> 04:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
straight to
 
04:18:13.640 --> 04:18:15.269 align:start position:0%
straight to
mediation

04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
04:18:18.389 --> 04:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
um I think we can simplify the process
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what the special ad Advocate
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
was talking about was simplifying the
 
04:18:27.630 --> 04:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
process um and this uh I hope is one
 
04:18:30.910 --> 04:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
small step in simplifying the
 
04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
process um because it's um a gauntlet
 
04:18:37.349 --> 04:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
that uh parents have to go through
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
um to get services and I I know of
 
04:18:43.710 --> 04:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
current parents who are uh I know of one
 
04:18:47.870 --> 04:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
parent who has been struggling for three
 
04:18:51.070 --> 04:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
years to get services for their
 
04:18:51.080 --> 04:18:52.590 align:start position:0%
years to get services for their
child

04:18:52.590 --> 04:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:18:54.910 --> 04:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
and they're they're trying to make a
 
04:18:56.269 --> 04:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
decision right now they have the
 
04:18:58.030 --> 04:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
resources they can go out and get the
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
services on a private basis or should
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
they stay and fight because it impacts
 
04:19:07.109 --> 04:19:07.119 align:start position:0%
other kids too and right now now they're
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
continuing to stay in fight for the
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
services they think are needed for their
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
child we have to do better um and we
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
heard that from the special edit
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
advocate so I I think it's a a matter of
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
simplification it's a matter of just as
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
a first step you know we heard also
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
about um the manuals and the guidance
 
04:19:36.349 --> 04:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
that's available um you know manuals
 
04:19:38.429 --> 04:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
this thick for parents to try and figure
 
04:19:41.030 --> 04:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
out how do they get through the
 
04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
process um is that right um can't we
 
04:19:48.349 --> 04:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
simplify things for the for the parent
 
04:19:53.189 --> 04:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
but also um there's
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
um well I I I won't go into that right
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
now but um that's the reason that I am
 
04:20:03.550 --> 04:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
um putting forward um this amendment and
 
04:20:07.950 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh I I think it is um a small step
 
04:20:12.149 --> 04:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:15.670 --> 04:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you simply because it is a
 
04:20:18.189 --> 04:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
complex issue and I'm not sure what the
 
04:20:21.590 --> 04:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
real answer and um representative
 
04:20:23.630 --> 04:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
Cordell I appreciate your diligence to
 
04:20:28.229 --> 04:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
this could I ask um um our our
 
04:20:30.309 --> 04:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
specialist over here if she would come
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
forward from the Hampshire school boards
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
Association and just explain the impact
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
of what this amendment would do I just
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to do I don't want to vote
 
04:20:40.590 --> 04:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
for anything that I might be taking
 
04:20:43.510 --> 04:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
something away from appearance
 
04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
options would it be
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
okay that would be great yes yeah but
 
04:20:54.590 --> 04:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
what thank you Mr CH good afternoon for
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Becky Wilson uh director
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
of governmental relations for the New
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school board
 
04:21:09.269 --> 04:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
Association uh previously known as a
 
04:21:12.990 --> 04:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
director Becky do have you seen the
 
04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
amendment I've not seen the amendment
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure someone can just read it to
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
me I will read it to you quickly okay
 
04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're G I just don't
 
04:21:27.149 --> 04:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
understand would this be a an option
 
04:21:30.670 --> 04:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
taken away from parents in the multitude
 
04:21:34.229 --> 04:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
available I guess thank you for the
 
04:21:38.269 --> 04:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
question I guess I would defer that to
 
04:21:39.790 --> 04:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli since he's
 
04:21:42.189 --> 04:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
brought forth uh this amendment it would
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
appear to me that's just removing
 
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
neutral conference as an option is that
 
04:21:52.429 --> 04:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
so it's it's difficult I listened to the
 
04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill originally and on
 
04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
the discussion about the neutral
 
04:22:01.510 --> 04:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
conference um and I was just sort of
 
04:22:03.070 --> 04:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
trying to put down some notes a little
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
bit while I was listening to you all
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
talk I think and again I'm not speaking
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the office of the special
 
04:22:11.469 --> 04:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
ed Advocate or any of the complaints
 
04:22:12.990 --> 04:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
that have been heard at the department
 
04:22:15.990 --> 04:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
level or anything to that effect in the
 
04:22:18.870 --> 04:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
past dispute resolution was to some
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
extent a ladder it was not to parallel
 
04:22:23.309 --> 04:22:23.319 align:start position:0%
processes as it feels like it's been
 
04:22:24.990 --> 04:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
perceived most
 
04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
recently um if you had a dispute as an
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
IEP team you would have the option for
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
example to have your IEP meeting
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
facilitated which I think was discussed
 
04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
at at length last time I will tell you
 
04:22:40.630 --> 04:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
that in 2018 I requested an IEP
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
facilitation from the department and uh
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
the director of special ed at the time
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
Becky fet said she would be happy to
 
04:22:48.510 --> 04:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
come facilitate my meeting but she was
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
the only person trained to do it at the
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
time and as a district it would be
 
04:22:55.870 --> 04:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
difficult for my staff to have the
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
office of the special education director
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
of the state facilitating your IEP
 
04:23:02.429 --> 04:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
meeting so that would option while it
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
was probably the most important and most
 
04:23:08.429 --> 04:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate wasn't really available and
 
04:23:10.349 --> 04:23:10.359 align:start position:0%
that was to know nobody's fault it was
 
04:23:11.790 --> 04:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
just the situation at hand at the
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
department which you spoke about earlier
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
was underst staffed and had no IEP
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
facilitator um neutral conference for a
 
04:23:21.429 --> 04:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
very long time was purported to be a
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
situation where if you had a um case
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
that had gone through mediation and
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
could not be resolved had gone through
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
facilitation and could not be resolved
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
that in order to save both parties some
 
04:23:37.389 --> 04:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
angst and to try to preserve your
 
04:23:39.990 --> 04:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
relationship as an IEP team you would go
 
04:23:42.429 --> 04:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
to a neutral conference to present your
 
04:23:44.030 --> 04:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
case as if you were going to a due
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
process hearing and the hearing officer
 
04:23:48.269 --> 04:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
would tell you generally how they
 
04:23:50.070 --> 04:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
thought they might rule on the case were
 
04:23:53.389 --> 04:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
it to go to doe process it was meant to
 
04:23:53.399 --> 04:23:54.469 align:start position:0%
it to go to doe process it was meant to
try

04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
try
 
04:23:57.910 --> 04:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
to alleviate some of the concerns that I
 
04:23:59.070 --> 04:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
hear coming from this committee
 
04:24:01.109 --> 04:24:01.119 align:start position:0%
currently which is that people would
 
04:24:02.630 --> 04:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
have to fight and fight and fight and go
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
through this massive due process hearing
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
only to find out maybe that they hadn't
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
really thought through what the
 
04:24:09.990 --> 04:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
consequences could be or what the
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
outcome would be Etc it was meant to
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
preserve um the team's ability to make a
 
04:24:17.950 --> 04:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
decision at that point about whether or
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
not they wanted to go forward with due
 
04:24:22.830 --> 04:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
process it sounds to me based off of
 
04:24:24.429 --> 04:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
what the office of the special ed
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
Advocate is portraying that it's maybe
 
04:24:29.870 --> 04:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
turned into some other kind of process
 
04:24:32.710 --> 04:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
um however I do know you know the office
 
04:24:35.590 --> 04:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
of the special ed Advocate I think the
 
04:24:38.109 --> 04:24:38.119 align:start position:0%
entire role of that person is to hear
 
04:24:39.910 --> 04:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
problems so all they're going to hear is
 
04:24:41.710 --> 04:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
problems they're not I don't know if
 
04:24:44.189 --> 04:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
neutral conference has been used in a
 
04:24:46.950 --> 04:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
different way with other cases um so if
 
04:24:49.229 --> 04:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
you were to remove
 
04:24:52.389 --> 04:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
that my my two cents from that would be
 
04:24:54.750 --> 04:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
that if you had gone to facilitation and
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
or mediation and needed to go to doe
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
process teams would no longer have the
 
04:25:01.670 --> 04:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
option to sort of vet out their case
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
before going through a due process
 
04:25:04.830 --> 04:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and if you have ever been
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
through a due process hearing say in 21
 
04:25:09.510 --> 04:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
years I went to Due Process two times
 
04:25:10.710 --> 04:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
everything else I probably went to
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
mediation maybe 10 times total and there
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's important to recall that in some
 
04:25:18.990 --> 04:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
situations a district has to get
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
resolution on a special education
 
04:25:23.229 --> 04:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
decision and the district has to file
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
for mediation or due process it's not
 
04:25:27.750 --> 04:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
always the parent that is pushing that
 
04:25:30.189 --> 04:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
there are resolutions that have to
 
04:25:32.109 --> 04:25:32.119 align:start position:0%
happen legally and a district can't just
 
04:25:33.990 --> 04:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
sit on decisions because you wouldn't be
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
fulfilling your obligation to students
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
so if you were to remove neutral
 
04:25:40.109 --> 04:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
conference from the option it sounds to
 
04:25:42.189 --> 04:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
me as though you would maybe do IEP
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
facilitation possibly there's two people
 
04:25:46.349 --> 04:25:46.359 align:start position:0%
in the state that can do that right now
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
you might go to mediation if you felt
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
like it was something that you could
 
04:25:51.269 --> 04:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
resolve through mediation but there are
 
04:25:55.269 --> 04:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
some situations as with any Ed or not
 
04:25:56.910 --> 04:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
related that would go to mediation where
 
04:25:58.269 --> 04:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know there's no resolve
 
04:26:00.510 --> 04:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
coming from that process that you would
 
04:26:03.030 --> 04:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
no longer have the option to sort of
 
04:26:04.750 --> 04:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
think about a neutral conference as an
 
04:26:06.109 --> 04:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
option you would just have to go right
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm sorry just a quick followup
 
04:26:17.790 --> 04:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like the preparation for
 
04:26:20.070 --> 04:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
due process might happen a little bit in
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
that neutral setting thank you yes
 
04:26:25.630 --> 04:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct I mean you you are I
 
04:26:26.950 --> 04:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to call it a mock hearing
 
04:26:29.309 --> 04:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
it's not it it carries much more
 
04:26:31.710 --> 04:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
emotional and otherwise weight than a
 
04:26:33.790 --> 04:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
mock hearing um but yeah you're
 
04:26:36.630 --> 04:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
preparing your cases on both sides
 
04:26:39.030 --> 04:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
to try to see if it is worth it quite
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
honestly because it it takes a toll on
 
04:26:42.830 --> 04:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
people as you've heard in this committee
 
04:26:45.149 --> 04:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
financially but also emotionally if
 
04:26:46.830 --> 04:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to a neutral conference or
 
04:26:49.030 --> 04:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
a due process hearing on a case where
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
the child is Young For example the
 
04:26:53.070 --> 04:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
district test and maintain a
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
relationship with that family for a very
 
04:26:57.109 --> 04:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
long time after this situation and you
 
04:26:59.309 --> 04:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
have many more IEPs yet to come you
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to go to Due
 
04:27:03.389 --> 04:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
Process over something that maybe is not
 
04:27:06.030 --> 04:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
going to result in an ability to move
 
04:27:11.790 --> 04:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:14.910 --> 04:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you um just to add to that
 
04:27:17.229 --> 04:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
so there are two I think I explained
 
04:27:19.030 --> 04:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
this the other day you can correct me if
 
04:27:21.630 --> 04:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong there is an informal process
 
04:27:23.950 --> 04:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
for alternative dispute resolution and
 
04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
there's an informal the informal
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
generally has someone who knows special
 
04:27:32.830 --> 04:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
education has experience in it to try to
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
mediate the situation if we repeal this
 
04:27:40.030 --> 04:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill this takes away some autonomy for a
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
parent or a school district to go to the
 
04:27:45.550 --> 04:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
formal level of dispute resolution
 
04:27:47.790 --> 04:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
because then instead of the neutral
 
04:27:49.950 --> 04:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
person being the specialist in special
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
ed or the practitioner you have an
 
04:27:56.670 --> 04:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
attorney who knows special ed laws so
 
04:28:00.269 --> 04:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
they can advise the team prior to taking
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
this to due process and maybe it would
 
04:28:04.630 --> 04:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
be resolved in that fashion but there
 
04:28:07.389 --> 04:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
are two separate different means of
 
04:28:09.750 --> 04:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
dispute uh dispute
 
04:28:14.109 --> 04:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
resolution um and they're both um they
 
04:28:16.910 --> 04:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
each have their specialist on board
 
04:28:18.830 --> 04:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
which gives another option to parents so
 
04:28:21.469 --> 04:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
I don't know why we would want to take
 
04:28:25.830 --> 04:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
away an opportunity for parents I so I
 
04:28:30.510 --> 04:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:33.870 --> 04:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
OTP thank you Mr chair and Miss
 
04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
Wilson I I'm
 
04:28:40.070 --> 04:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
I need I need some help here I may need
 
04:28:43.030 --> 04:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
help a lot of help over but anyway on
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
this I was totally confused when the
 
04:28:48.189 --> 04:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
parent advocate got through going like
 
04:28:53.790 --> 04:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
this and all this so if you could for me
 
04:28:57.109 --> 04:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
finally go through the steps okay so I
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
have an IEP with my
 
04:29:03.469 --> 04:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
child and I agree with the IEP all right
 
04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
simple set that aside I disagree with
 
04:29:08.720 --> 04:29:09.910 align:start position:0%
simple set that aside I disagree with
the

04:29:09.910 --> 04:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
IEP can you tell me what happens next
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
what are my Alternatives and I'm
 
04:29:17.389 --> 04:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned with what
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden said as far as I
 
04:29:22.269 --> 04:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
want to provide as many options without
 
04:29:22.279 --> 04:29:23.590 align:start position:0%
want to provide as many options without
confusing

04:29:23.590 --> 04:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
parents for what their options are so if
 
04:29:29.469 --> 04:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
you could kind of I'm in dispute now
 
04:29:31.710 --> 04:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
what what are the steps that I go
 
04:29:34.790 --> 04:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
through and how that how's that all work
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question I will
 
04:29:39.469 --> 04:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
do my best to be sustin in this and I'm
 
04:29:41.189 --> 04:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
going to work from the position that
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps your child has already had an
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
IEP for some time and that because if it
 
04:29:47.349 --> 04:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
is an initial IP that is a
 
04:29:49.830 --> 04:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
separate a separate discussion because
 
04:29:51.149 --> 04:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
there are some parental consent
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
requirements that are different for the
 
04:29:54.910 --> 04:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
very first time a child is identified
 
04:29:57.229 --> 04:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
versus moving forward so assuming your
 
04:29:59.349 --> 04:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
child's been identified and they've
 
04:30:02.429 --> 04:30:02.439 align:start position:0%
already had an IEP and now the IEP is
 
04:30:04.590 --> 04:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
due for the annual review you get
 
04:30:07.030 --> 04:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
through the IEP process you get I'll use
 
04:30:09.030 --> 04:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
an assumption What I Hear often in this
 
04:30:10.990 --> 04:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
committee to the service delivery page
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's a um disagreement
 
04:30:17.550 --> 04:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
about how many services what services
 
04:30:19.590 --> 04:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
how long the services are
 
04:30:22.030 --> 04:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
Etc there is a provision in special
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
education called stay put which
 
04:30:25.670 --> 04:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
basically means that the team must
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
operate based on the last agreed upon
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
IEP until the dispute is resolved so
 
04:30:33.510 --> 04:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
whatever was agreed upon in the last IEP
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
where the entire team agreed which is
 
04:30:37.990 --> 04:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
the parents included that continues to
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
happen there's no just cut off of the
 
04:30:43.149 --> 04:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
child services while you figure out
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
what's happening next whatever was
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
happening previously continues to happen
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's also not uncommon that if for
 
04:30:52.750 --> 04:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
example the child's getting three or
 
04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
four services on that page and the
 
04:30:57.429 --> 04:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
parent agrees with three out of the four
 
04:30:59.349 --> 04:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
that you would agree as a team and this
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
is all written up in agreement with the
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
parent that you would provide the new
 
04:31:06.189 --> 04:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
services for those three that everyone
 
04:31:07.990 --> 04:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
agrees on and you would just continue to
 
04:31:10.269 --> 04:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do with this fourth
 
04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
service if you cannot come to an
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
agreement and the team can continue to
 
04:31:16.830 --> 04:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
meet and have as many meetings as the
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
parent and the team are willing to do
 
04:31:20.550 --> 04:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
together to try to resolve it if you get
 
04:31:22.710 --> 04:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
to a point where you can't resolve it
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
most often the next step would be
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
mediation that's most common IEP
 
04:31:30.109 --> 04:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
facilitation would be an option but
 
04:31:32.189 --> 04:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
again if you aren't really having a
 
04:31:35.149 --> 04:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
problem creating the IEP it's you
 
04:31:36.670 --> 04:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
realize you get to a point where there's
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
sort of this you know unfixable moment
 
04:31:41.590 --> 04:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
you would go to mediation and the goal
 
04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
of that is to preserve your relationship
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
as a team so that you can do this again
 
04:31:48.510 --> 04:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
next year when you have an IEP without
 
04:31:50.830 --> 04:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
having to go to mediation you would go
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
to mediation it mediation looks
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
different for every team sometimes
 
04:31:56.670 --> 04:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
everyone's in the same room sometimes
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's much more what you would picture
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
from a family court situation with
 
04:32:02.630 --> 04:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
mediation where some people are in one
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
room once in the other people go back
 
04:32:06.389 --> 04:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
and forth the med Creator's job is to
 
04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
try to resolve in the best interest of
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
both parties whatever the issue is if
 
04:32:15.229 --> 04:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
that does not work the parent and the
 
04:32:18.229 --> 04:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
team whoever's G put this process in
 
04:32:21.510 --> 04:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
place in the first place has a decision
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
you can agree to go either way so agree
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
with what the parent is saying and amend
 
04:32:32.710 --> 04:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
the IEP for that issue or not and if not
 
04:32:34.229 --> 04:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
then you have to resolve it you can't
 
04:32:35.950 --> 04:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
just leave this
 
04:32:39.349 --> 04:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
issue out to dry um you would have to go
 
04:32:42.670 --> 04:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
to a due process hearing um or the
 
04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
parent would have to pursue a due
 
04:32:47.229 --> 04:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
process hearing if they felt that it was
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
something they really wanted to go
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
through for this
 
04:32:54.990 --> 04:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
issue but the old IEP is still happening
 
04:32:56.950 --> 04:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
all this time that you that the adults
 
04:32:59.550 --> 04:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
are doing all of this stuff over here
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
the student is still getting the last
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
agreed upon services so so just if I may
 
04:33:07.310 --> 04:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
so where does the facilitated
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
conversation take place in the process
 
04:33:10.830 --> 04:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
you just
 
04:33:13.269 --> 04:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
outlined in theory before you would ever
 
04:33:15.310 --> 04:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
go to mediation where the team has been
 
04:33:16.869 --> 04:33:16.879 align:start position:0%
trying to resolve this issue and they
 
04:33:19.310 --> 04:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
say you know what it's too emotional
 
04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
everyone is too in mesed at this point
 
04:33:23.310 --> 04:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
we need someone to come in and run this
 
04:33:25.349 --> 04:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
meeting for us to focus on the issue and
 
04:33:27.269 --> 04:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
see if they can pick up on something
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
that we're not picking up on and come to
 
04:33:30.869 --> 04:33:30.879 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you for that
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:38.470 --> 04:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:33:41.990 --> 04:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
you at what point in all this process if
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
any does the state director of special
 
04:33:48.269 --> 04:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
education become involved thank you for
 
04:33:48.279 --> 04:33:49.269 align:start position:0%
education become involved thank you for
the

04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:49.279 --> 04:33:50.869 align:start position:0%
the
question

04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
typically the department is only getting
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
involved if there is a complaint which
 
04:33:59.869 --> 04:33:59.879 align:start position:0%
is different than not agreeing on an i
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's a process that is totally
 
04:34:04.029 --> 04:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
separate from making a department of Ed
 
04:34:07.029 --> 04:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
complaint even even then the director of
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
special ed themselves would not
 
04:34:10.510 --> 04:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily be the person taking the
 
04:34:12.109 --> 04:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
complaint I think it was said earlier
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
right now that's Steven Berwick
 
04:34:19.230 --> 04:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
um they re they really would not ever be
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
involved as a role specifically the
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
reason that Miss fet would have been
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
involved in the past might have been
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
because she was the only person that was
 
04:34:28.910 --> 04:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
trained and qualified to provide the IEP
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
facilitation so if you ask for that if
 
04:34:32.910 --> 04:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
you put in a request for that to the
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
department and she is the only person
 
04:34:37.349 --> 04:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
that's qualified to provide that service
 
04:34:41.150 --> 04:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
at that time she might have become
 
04:34:44.629 --> 04:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you um mentioned facilitated
 
04:34:52.429 --> 04:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
IEPs am I correct in that the um the
 
04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
process begins with the IEP if there is
 
04:34:58.189 --> 04:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
no agreement they could move to a
 
04:34:58.199 --> 04:34:59.709 align:start position:0%
no agreement they could move to a
facilitated

04:34:59.709 --> 04:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
facilitated
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
IEP and if there's still no um agreement
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
then you would take a different path
 
04:35:07.510 --> 04:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
such as mediation or something else is
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
that correct thank you for the question
 
04:35:12.429 --> 04:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
yes although I personally I would
 
04:35:14.510 --> 04:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
consider it all one PA it's one path you
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
have a dispute that you are trying to
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
resolve it's dispute resolution
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of what method you take um
 
04:35:21.789 --> 04:35:21.799 align:start position:0%
it's just there are certain timelines
 
04:35:23.670 --> 04:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
and things like that that are embedded
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
in each step so that you don't put any
 
04:35:28.230 --> 04:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
team in a position where this dispute is
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
going on for years at a time you have
 
04:35:32.510 --> 04:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
certain timelines that you have to abide
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
by so that in the child's best interest
 
04:35:36.269 --> 04:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
and in the team's best interest you're
 
04:35:37.789 --> 04:35:37.799 align:start position:0%
not just letting things hang out there
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
end so then the
 
04:35:49.470 --> 04:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
neutral would come after the um
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
potentially after the mediation if that
 
04:35:55.590 --> 04:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
still didn't work but before you
 
04:35:58.750 --> 04:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
actually go to court you would do this
 
04:36:02.310 --> 04:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
to get an idea of how that might happen
 
04:36:04.349 --> 04:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
and at that point you might realize this
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
is not going to work anyways I withdraw
 
04:36:09.869 --> 04:36:09.879 align:start position:0%
or you might say oh I need this
 
04:36:12.510 --> 04:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
additional information to bring with me
 
04:36:14.629 --> 04:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
when I go and that kind of stuff thank
 
04:36:18.029 --> 04:36:18.039 align:start position:0%
you for the question yes just I you also
 
04:36:19.709 --> 04:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
might learn in neutral conference that
 
04:36:22.109 --> 04:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's not going to go the way
 
04:36:24.510 --> 04:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
either side thinks it's going to go and
 
04:36:26.029 --> 04:36:26.039 align:start position:0%
so you might be willing to go back to
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
mediation mediation is not mandatory in
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
this ladder of dispute resolution it's
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
optional and both parties have to agree
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
to go to mediation so so if the district
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
or the parent says you know what this
 
04:36:40.429 --> 04:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
isn't something we we've been trying to
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
work this out for x amount of time
 
04:36:44.349 --> 04:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
mediation is just going to further harm
 
04:36:45.990 --> 04:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
our relationship with this family they
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
might not go they might just say you
 
04:36:49.709 --> 04:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
know listen we need to get a result on
 
04:36:51.910 --> 04:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
this but yes neutral conference would
 
04:36:53.670 --> 04:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
then allow people to sort of have an
 
04:36:55.629 --> 04:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
idea of what they were getting
 
04:37:00.150 --> 04:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
term thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
you so if I'm
 
04:37:07.709 --> 04:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
understanding this correctly neutral
 
04:37:11.150 --> 04:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
conference is to prevent the need to
 
04:37:14.551 --> 04:37:14.561 align:start position:0%
have a due process hearing is that
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
because it's less costly and maybe less
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
of an emotional toll or is that a
 
04:37:21.269 --> 04:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
correct summarization of it thank you
 
04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I don't
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
want to ascribe what people would get
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
out of neutral conference to having up
 
04:37:29.670 --> 04:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
in every situation is very
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
individualized as is special education
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
as a whole um I think the intent
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
originally and again the office of the
 
04:37:38.109 --> 04:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
04:37:40.510 --> 04:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
Advocate explained some things in a way
 
04:37:43.390 --> 04:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
that is based off of her perception of
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
how things are going and I know that's a
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
very new position so I don't want to
 
04:37:49.429 --> 04:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
misspeak in terms of how she presented
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
those things on her hand I will tell you
 
04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
that when we went to neutral conference
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
if ever you were to go it was to try
 
04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
to get to a point where everybody could
 
04:38:02.590 --> 04:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
could see that things were just going to
 
04:38:05.949 --> 04:38:05.959 align:start position:0%
become more difficult by to go down this
 
04:38:08.830 --> 04:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
very litigious Road as opposed to trying
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
to be more open to going back to trying
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
to resolve it in a much more
 
04:38:16.949 --> 04:38:16.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
you afternoon I'm sure glad you came in
 
04:38:22.869 --> 04:38:22.879 align:start position:0%
today just the question would it be fair
 
04:38:25.029 --> 04:38:25.039 align:start position:0%
to say then U not the original bill but
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
on the amendment that this is the appeal
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
based on the amendment would actually um
 
04:38:34.390 --> 04:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
limit a parents opportunity and probably
 
04:38:36.230 --> 04:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
negate something the two of
 
04:38:39.230 --> 04:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
walks thank you for the question I don't
 
04:38:40.510 --> 04:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
again I don't want
 
04:38:43.070 --> 04:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
to um try to guess at what the
 
04:38:45.189 --> 04:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
Department's intention was or what the
 
04:38:47.349 --> 04:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
original intention was in terms of this
 
04:38:50.310 --> 04:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
bill I I will say yeah if you take it
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
away it's no longer an option thank you
 
04:38:56.070 --> 04:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.109 --> 04:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
you for being here um this is really
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
helpful this list here but um there
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
weren't very many neutral conferences in
 
04:39:09.070 --> 04:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years compared to other
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
things like mediation and of the ones
 
04:39:13.470 --> 04:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
that there were
 
04:39:16.470 --> 04:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
only three were settled in the neutral
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
conference so having that option there
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
is that maintaining a cost that's not
 
04:39:24.990 --> 04:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
used very much or is it just something
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
that people are otherwise occupied is it
 
04:39:30.189 --> 04:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
a special group that we would lose or is
 
04:39:32.070 --> 04:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
this something that's covered by the the
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
people that do the other things as well
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for the question I would
 
04:39:38.470 --> 04:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
want you to confirm with the Department
 
04:39:40.270 --> 04:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
who's currently acting as the hearing
 
04:39:42.510 --> 04:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
officers for the neutral conferences in
 
04:39:45.390 --> 04:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
the past it's this it's the same pool of
 
04:39:47.948 --> 04:39:47.958 align:start position:0%
people so to speak that would be hearing
 
04:39:51.868 --> 04:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
the due process case obviously not the
 
04:39:53.110 --> 04:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
same person you wouldn't have the same
 
04:39:54.390 --> 04:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
person hearing neutral conference and
 
04:39:56.750 --> 04:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
then hearing the due process case but
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
it's the same pool of people I don't
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
know who's currently doing it I have not
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
gone to neutral conference in many many
 
04:40:08.550 --> 04:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
years um so I don't know what the cost
 
04:40:10.948 --> 04:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the department would be
 
04:40:13.948 --> 04:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
um the cost in terms of fiscal costs at
 
04:40:15.910 --> 04:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
the depart at the district level or at a
 
04:40:18.590 --> 04:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
parent level if you're at the point
 
04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
where you're going to neutral conference
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
you're have those costs regardless
 
04:40:24.150 --> 04:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
probably because you're trying to
 
04:40:26.350 --> 04:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
resolve something that needs to be
 
04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
resolved thank you are there any
 
04:40:31.470 --> 04:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
specific criteria for a person that is
 
04:40:31.480 --> 04:40:32.310 align:start position:0%
specific criteria for a person that is
coming

04:40:32.310 --> 04:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
coming
 
04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:38.040 --> 04:40:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:40:39.670 --> 04:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
um again I don't want I don't hire um
 
04:40:48.430 --> 04:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
any of the people that are the leads in
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
those separate areas I will tell you I
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
believe the two current people in the
 
04:40:54.310 --> 04:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
state that are providing IEP
 
04:40:58.110 --> 04:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
facilitation are either uh retired
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
special education administrators so they
 
04:41:02.788 --> 04:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
do have some level of special ed law
 
04:41:07.070 --> 04:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge or at least the process or are
 
04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
retired or add specialed Advocates that
 
04:41:12.030 --> 04:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
tend to work with families that no
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
longer are doing that actively um you
 
04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
know you certainly would need to have a
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
level of understanding of the IEP
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
process to be able to facilitate an IEP
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
meeting in the past um not so much
 
04:41:25.990 --> 04:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
anymore but I believe the parent
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
information center and several other
 
04:41:30.750 --> 04:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
organizations have provided IEP
 
04:41:32.830 --> 04:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
facilitators to teams as part of a
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
parent partnership with school districts
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
across the state um they will come in
 
04:41:38.948 --> 04:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
and help with that there's there are
 
04:41:41.110 --> 04:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
other people besides the department that
 
04:41:43.230 --> 04:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
in the past have offered that service
 
04:41:44.628 --> 04:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
but it may have been because there was
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
just a lack of resource at the
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
department level so people were willing
 
04:41:50.030 --> 04:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
to do those things uh the neutral
 
04:41:52.030 --> 04:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
conference off and the due process
 
04:41:54.110 --> 04:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
hearing officers to
 
04:41:57.390 --> 04:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
my recollection are mainly attorneys
 
04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
because it is an attorney based process
 
04:42:02.150 --> 04:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
at that point when you go to a due
 
04:42:04.150 --> 04:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
process hearing mediators are often
 
04:42:10.590 --> 04:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:19.550 --> 04:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
welcome so what I so see if I just want
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
to clarify what we have before us we
 
04:42:25.350 --> 04:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
have the original Hobson
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill which basically provides some
 
04:42:33.510 --> 04:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
clarification on the role of the neutral
 
04:42:35.708 --> 04:42:35.718 align:start position:0%
that's one issue
 
04:42:37.788 --> 04:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
the second issue is the cordellia
 
04:42:40.350 --> 04:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
amendment which basically
 
04:42:43.788 --> 04:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
repeals that option is that is that am I
 
04:42:46.910 --> 04:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
understanding me to be an expert on
 
04:42:53.708 --> 04:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
this and and there's what's in law right
 
04:42:56.190 --> 04:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
now and there's what's in law too so so
 
04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
I just think as I just as I really
 
04:43:00.910 --> 04:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh Miss Wilson's explanation
 
04:43:03.310 --> 04:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
it's really clarified a lot for me after
 
04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
being with this for 12 years but but
 
04:43:08.788 --> 04:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
anyway so those are the two issues you
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
got the repeal versus the clarification
 
04:43:13.150 --> 04:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:43:15.150 --> 04:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
alternative that's what's before us and
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
what's before us right now what's on the
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
floor is the repeal Amendment from
 
04:43:24.990 --> 04:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
cordelli is that correct that's how I
 
04:43:28.470 --> 04:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
see it okay thank you very much cordelli
 
04:43:32.350 --> 04:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um a few things
 
04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
um we just heard that the special ad
 
04:43:38.948 --> 04:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
education Advocate um maybe has a
 
04:43:40.470 --> 04:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
different view of things because she
 
04:43:42.830 --> 04:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
works with parents who are having
 
04:43:45.390 --> 04:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
problems well that's why we had an
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
advocate to begin with because of all
 
04:43:50.670 --> 04:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
the problems we've heard about I well
 
04:43:52.470 --> 04:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry did I you no just I'm
 
04:43:59.310 --> 04:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:01.350 --> 04:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
Tanner um
 
04:44:03.868 --> 04:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
so that's why we have the special eded
 
04:44:06.590 --> 04:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
advocate because there were problems
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
after the study committee we had
 
04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
um um we put into place a performance
 
04:44:17.430 --> 04:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
audit on the
 
04:44:21.628 --> 04:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
department um then Senator rean turned
 
04:44:24.948 --> 04:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
to me and said let's do something
 
04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
big so we drafted the special ed
 
04:44:27.760 --> 04:44:29.430 align:start position:0%
big so we drafted the special ed
Advocate

04:44:29.430 --> 04:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
Advocate
 
04:44:32.708 --> 04:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
law um and that's right she hears from
 
04:44:34.350 --> 04:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
parents who are having problems but
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
isn't that who we want to hear
 
04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
from if everything's going along fine
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
then great Dandy we want to hear from
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
the parents and help the parents who are
 
04:44:45.600 --> 04:44:47.430 align:start position:0%
the parents and help the parents who are
having

04:44:47.430 --> 04:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
problems um secondly um I also talked to
 
04:44:55.628 --> 04:44:55.638 align:start position:0%
um an advocate who was trained in the
 
04:44:58.150 --> 04:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
parent information center who agreed
 
04:45:01.990 --> 04:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
that this is a meaningless step in the
 
04:45:05.788 --> 04:45:05.798 align:start position:0%
process and as um representative dry
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
pointed out there have been seven
 
04:45:12.110 --> 04:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
neutral conferences in 10
 
04:45:14.510 --> 04:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
years seven and 10
 
04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
years so you know if if
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
we get rid of the neutral controverses
 
04:45:23.310 --> 04:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
we're not turning the special ed process
 
04:45:23.320 --> 04:45:24.590 align:start position:0%
we're not turning the special ed process
upside

04:45:24.590 --> 04:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
upside
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
down maybe we're simplifying it for
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.280 --> 04:45:36.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:45:36.030 --> 04:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
thank you um no matter how often it's
 
04:45:41.190 --> 04:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
been used it has been used and obviously
 
04:45:43.390 --> 04:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
it has worked with a few but I'm just
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
going to say you want to take away a
 
04:45:55.190 --> 04:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
parents thank you Mr chair and and I
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
believe it is a choice for parents
 
04:46:01.868 --> 04:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
because there doesn't appear to be
 
04:46:07.230 --> 04:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
anything in the um in the uh ADR statute
 
04:46:07.240 --> 04:46:08.550 align:start position:0%
anything in the um in the uh ADR statute

04:46:08.550 --> 04:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
186
 
04:46:11.868 --> 04:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
c23 that um that requires a neutral
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
conference to be held prior to mediation
 
04:46:17.110 --> 04:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
I think um the parties could uh could
 
04:46:21.990 --> 04:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
could could decide to do um um uh either
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
one of those things or maybe even both
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
of those things um to come to a
 
04:46:28.430 --> 04:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion so I don't know why we'd want
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.200 --> 04:46:37.110 align:start position:0%

U Frau with all kinds of questions
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
Etc and um I originally was I was
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
originally going to vote OTP on this but
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
I think I've changed my mind because I
 
05:10:30.390 --> 05:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
think there are questions about why is
 
05:10:32.350 --> 05:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
the change what is the change there's
 
05:10:35.150 --> 05:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
confu as I said I was confused about
 
05:10:38.510 --> 05:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
what the uh parent advoc had to say uh
 
05:10:41.310 --> 05:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Wilson basically helped clarify at
 
05:10:43.470 --> 05:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
least the process that was
 
05:10:46.470 --> 05:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
important if if the OTP fails I would
 
05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
put forth an interim study committee uh
 
05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%

05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
motion thank you I'd like to make a
 
05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:33.868 --> 05:13:33.878 align:start position:0%
itl I do and I I have nothing against
 
05:13:36.430 --> 05:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
eating hotlines or eating disorder help
 
05:13:39.030 --> 05:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
or anything like that I just know that
 
05:13:40.910 --> 05:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the world that I live in with social
 
05:13:44.350 --> 05:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
service agencies we are moving to a
 
05:13:46.590 --> 05:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
three digigit number because it's easier
 
05:13:50.350 --> 05:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
for people to remember 988 is the number
 
05:13:52.548 --> 05:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
um at this point the average weight from
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
988 247 is 41 seconds and um you're met
 
05:14:02.430 --> 05:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
by uh an operator who can triage
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
the subject that the person is calling
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
about the national disorder hotline
 
05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
that's going proposed for this ID is
 
05:14:14.948 --> 05:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
open 9 to 7 on weekdays and and they all
 
05:14:17.788 --> 05:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
recommend calling 988 if it's after
 
05:14:21.510 --> 05:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
hours so I'm just saying that I'm in
 
05:14:24.548 --> 05:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
my line of thinking I would like to go
 
05:14:28.070 --> 05:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
along with the trend in social service
 
05:14:36.070 --> 05:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would urge people
 
05:14:41.390 --> 05:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
to vote against the itl noting that we
 
05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
passed this bill last year with a
 
05:14:47.628 --> 05:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
different entity this is a solid 20
 
05:14:50.548 --> 05:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
year-old well well-respected
 
05:14:52.270 --> 05:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
organization people with eating
 
05:14:54.750 --> 05:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
disorders do not perceive themselves as
 
05:14:56.548 --> 05:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
in a mental health crisis that would
 
05:14:58.470 --> 05:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
lead them to call
 
05:15:01.230 --> 05:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
988 it is critically important that we
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
help them especially teenagers who have
 
05:15:06.270 --> 05:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
such a high incidence of Eating
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
Disorders to access care or
 
05:15:11.190 --> 05:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations for
 
05:15:13.548 --> 05:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
Care at the time that they are ready and
 
05:15:17.628 --> 05:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:20.230 --> 05:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
call uh thank you I just wanted to point
 
05:15:22.868 --> 05:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
out that we received express mail this
 
05:15:25.270 --> 05:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon from the National Alliance for
 
05:15:28.190 --> 05:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
heating disorders um and they indicate
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
that uh they plan to expand their hours
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
till 900 p.m. sometime within this year
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:48.708 --> 05:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
weekends thank you Mr chair um a after
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
the bit of a the ble we had with a very
 
05:15:53.590 --> 05:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
similar Bill last year regarding this I
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
decided to do a little bit more homework
 
05:15:58.910 --> 05:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
on this one and on this
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
organization and I have to say that what
 
05:16:05.708 --> 05:16:05.718 align:start position:0%
I found was um seemed a bit disturbing
 
05:16:08.110 --> 05:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
so reviewing the blog and some of the
 
05:16:09.430 --> 05:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
advice that's being given by the
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
organization in question it's clear that
 
05:16:14.350 --> 05:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
they ascribe to um what would commonly
 
05:16:16.830 --> 05:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
be known as the body positivity movement
 
05:16:19.150 --> 05:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
they offer advice recommending that you
 
05:16:22.590 --> 05:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
can be uh healthy at any size for people
 
05:16:24.350 --> 05:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
who are severely over Beast they
 
05:16:27.430 --> 05:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
recommend against dieting re
 
05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
recommending instead that they learn to
 
05:16:32.510 --> 05:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
love themselves exactly how they are are
 
05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
um now certainly people have every right
 
05:16:36.110 --> 05:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
to do so I don't think it would be very
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
consumable for us to direct somebody
 
05:16:40.430 --> 05:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
however to a medical Source providing
 
05:16:44.270 --> 05:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:47.948 --> 05:16:47.958 align:start position:0%
advice thank you Mr chair um so I voted
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
against the similar Bill last year I'm
 
05:16:53.628 --> 05:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
voting against this one too for the same
 
05:16:56.788 --> 05:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
reasons um and I I'm glad they're having
 
05:16:58.708 --> 05:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
expanded hours planning for expanded
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
hours um unless it's a 24/7 line I I
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
think that it's lacking um and you know
 
05:17:07.868 --> 05:17:07.878 align:start position:0%
in no way does this I'm sure you all
 
05:17:10.390 --> 05:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
know this we it's has nothing to do with
 
05:17:12.030 --> 05:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
how I feel like you know of course I
 
05:17:14.948 --> 05:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
care with kids with eating disorders um
 
05:17:18.110 --> 05:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
but also practically speaking let's see
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know an ID card is smaller than
 
05:17:22.590 --> 05:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
this paperclip box there are many other
 
05:17:24.830 --> 05:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
worthy causes where does it stop that's
 
05:17:27.788 --> 05:17:27.798 align:start position:0%
why I think this thre digigit movement
 
05:17:30.150 --> 05:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
is is a good one just for a practical
 
05:17:32.510 --> 05:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
from a practical point of view
 
05:17:39.390 --> 05:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:42.788 --> 05:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
itl thank you Mr chair one of the things
 
05:17:45.110 --> 05:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
that we did here in the
 
05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
testimony was that a eaing disorder is
 
05:17:50.230 --> 05:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
is a little
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
different um that some don't think that
 
05:17:57.390 --> 05:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
they have a problem uh yet they may we
 
05:17:59.548 --> 05:17:59.558 align:start position:0%
also discovered too that this particular
 
05:18:01.590 --> 05:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
hotline does more than just deal with
 
05:18:04.830 --> 05:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
those who may have the eating disorder
 
05:18:06.830 --> 05:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
it provides information to those who may
 
05:18:09.110 --> 05:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
have friends who have the problem or
 
05:18:11.948 --> 05:18:11.958 align:start position:0%
parents who have the problem so it is it
 
05:18:12.910 --> 05:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
is a
 
05:18:15.990 --> 05:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
resource that goes beyond just a crisis
 
05:18:19.430 --> 05:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
intervention kind of a thing and we also
 
05:18:21.708 --> 05:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
discovered that that the 988 number that
 
05:18:25.548 --> 05:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier that it
 
05:18:28.830 --> 05:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
tries the phone calls that come in this
 
05:18:31.548 --> 05:18:31.558 align:start position:0%
one deals specifically with issues
 
05:18:33.990 --> 05:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with that this particular topic
 
05:18:36.030 --> 05:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
so that's that's why I'm I'm going to
 
05:18:38.990 --> 05:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
vote against the I because I do think
 
05:18:41.868 --> 05:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
that this is something that will benefit
 
05:18:44.390 --> 05:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
those who have issues and those who are
 
05:18:46.910 --> 05:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
trying to support those who have issues
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:54.430 --> 05:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I
 
05:18:57.430 --> 05:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
guess my first point might be that this
 
05:19:00.548 --> 05:19:00.558 align:start position:0%
this disease this disorder is a hidden
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
disorder for the most part uh students
 
05:19:05.990 --> 05:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
go out of their way and know how to go
 
05:19:09.590 --> 05:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
out of their way to hide it um hide the
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
disorder they have it's not a
 
05:19:15.030 --> 05:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
crisis uh like suicide would be where
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
they have suicide ideation or
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
hallucinations and they need to get the
 
05:19:22.628 --> 05:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
phone number or a friend notices that
 
05:19:24.750 --> 05:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's cutting themselves and you
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
know it's getting pretty severe that's a
 
05:19:29.670 --> 05:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
crisis um the eating disorder can be
 
05:19:34.990 --> 05:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
very chronic it can last a lifetime and
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
it this this particular line and working
 
05:19:41.590 --> 05:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
with eating disorders and I'm no expert
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
but there are experts in the field and
 
05:19:49.310 --> 05:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
if positive body image is what is needed
 
05:19:51.750 --> 05:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
to treat that particular person at that
 
05:19:54.470 --> 05:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
particular time in their eating disorder
 
05:19:58.190 --> 05:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
I as a Layman is I'm not in a position
 
05:20:01.708 --> 05:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
to criticize or try to diagnose what
 
05:20:03.548 --> 05:20:03.558 align:start position:0%
they're doing or triage what they're
 
05:20:08.948 --> 05:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
doing um Eating Disorders are prolific
 
05:20:11.190 --> 05:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
in middle school high school and even
 
05:20:14.590 --> 05:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
down in elementary school and parents
 
05:20:16.510 --> 05:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
don't know how to handle it teachers
 
05:20:19.030 --> 05:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how to handle it um and like
 
05:20:21.590 --> 05:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
I said the kids often hide it I've i'
 
05:20:24.110 --> 05:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
over the years I taught I dealt with
 
05:20:26.910 --> 05:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
several families and kids girls that
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
that had this problem um and probably
 
05:20:32.910 --> 05:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
knew a bunch of other ones that had a
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
problem and and I didn't recognize it or
 
05:20:38.670 --> 05:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
they didn't bring it to me um it was
 
05:20:40.030 --> 05:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
going to the
 
05:20:43.628 --> 05:20:43.638 align:start position:0%
professionals that made a difference
 
05:20:47.310 --> 05:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
and particularly in school you know it
 
05:20:49.310 --> 05:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
isn't obvious where to go for eating
 
05:20:51.948 --> 05:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
disorders it's just like Matthew when he
 
05:20:54.670 --> 05:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
first talked to us about it here's this
 
05:20:57.830 --> 05:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
kid he's a boy so he probably you know
 
05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
has The Stereotype that he doesn't have
 
05:21:02.110 --> 05:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
a eating disorder although boys
 
05:21:05.628 --> 05:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
obviously do and was just he was trying
 
05:21:07.110 --> 05:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
to find some
 
05:21:10.548 --> 05:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
information and he wanted to talk to
 
05:21:12.310 --> 05:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
somebody that knew something about
 
05:21:12.320 --> 05:21:13.270 align:start position:0%
somebody that knew something about
eating

05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
eating
 
05:21:15.788 --> 05:21:15.798 align:start position:0%
disorders um he wasn't in crisis he
 
05:21:18.750 --> 05:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have called 988 and 988 is a
 
05:21:21.310 --> 05:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
wonderful number for crisis calls just
 
05:21:25.350 --> 05:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
like 911 or you know 511 for the road
 
05:21:27.670 --> 05:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
issues that you need on some of these
 
05:21:30.628 --> 05:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
morning drives in here but I I really
 
05:21:30.638 --> 05:21:31.590 align:start position:0%
morning drives in here but I I really
think

05:21:31.590 --> 05:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
that you know the fact that the card is
 
05:21:36.830 --> 05:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
small it people put numbers on them look
 
05:21:38.990 --> 05:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
at our uh driver's license how much
 
05:21:40.590 --> 05:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
information is crammed on the front and
 
05:21:43.548 --> 05:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
the back of the driver's license that's
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
not I think that's a red herring issue
 
05:21:48.510 --> 05:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
but the real issue is how can we help
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
these kids and what's going to make a
 
05:21:53.470 --> 05:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
difference and what's going to save
 
05:21:56.190 --> 05:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
lives and the quicker you get on this
 
05:21:58.750 --> 05:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
stuff the quicker you address the
 
05:22:01.948 --> 05:22:01.958 align:start position:0%
problem the better chances you have of
 
05:22:03.990 --> 05:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
ever correcting it and I'll I'll tell
 
05:22:06.750 --> 05:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
you again there's a person over my area
 
05:22:09.990 --> 05:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
that walks every day that has to be in
 
05:22:14.030 --> 05:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
her 60s late 50s 60s and has had Eating
 
05:22:15.990 --> 05:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
Disorders her whole life and is so
 
05:22:19.230 --> 05:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
crippled she's really
 
05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
almost unrecognizable I mean just
 
05:22:25.990 --> 05:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
unrecognizable and her bones are like so
 
05:22:29.830 --> 05:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
fragile um and her body her upper torso
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
is really even distorted from the
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
osteoporosis that she has
 
05:22:38.470 --> 05:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
so and she's dealing with it at that and
 
05:22:40.548 --> 05:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
she probably made it there because she
 
05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
had good medical care and and she had
 
05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
intervention otherwise she wouldn't have
 
05:22:47.948 --> 05:22:47.958 align:start position:0%
even made it that long but it's a it's a
 
05:22:50.390 --> 05:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
terrible thing and we need to do
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
something about it and if we save one
 
05:22:56.310 --> 05:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
kid if there's a Matthew Brown out there
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere today that looks at the cart
 
05:23:02.670 --> 05:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
calls that any disorder number and
 
05:23:04.948 --> 05:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
starts the process of getting
 
05:23:09.548 --> 05:23:09.558 align:start position:0%
help to me it's worth it so um I can't
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
tell you how important it is to vote for
 
05:23:12.240 --> 05:23:17.628 align:start position:0%
tell you how important it is to vote for
this

05:23:17.628 --> 05:23:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:20.548 --> 05:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
bill yeah I'm listening to these things
 
05:23:23.868 --> 05:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm thinking of it may be
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
something that might satisfy both of
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
them my concern with the eating disorder
 
05:23:30.240 --> 05:23:31.510 align:start position:0%
them my concern with the eating disorder
hotline

05:23:31.510 --> 05:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
hotline
 
05:23:34.990 --> 05:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
is that is limited hours and I think
 
05:23:36.868 --> 05:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
when somebody finally gets up the nerve
 
05:23:38.708 --> 05:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
to call there should be a human being on
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
the other end but my concern with the
 
05:23:45.670 --> 05:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
just 988 the way it is now is that
 
05:23:47.350 --> 05:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
somebody who has an eating disorder
 
05:23:49.830 --> 05:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
might not recognize that that's a number
 
05:23:53.830 --> 05:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
for them so I'm wondering what if we
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
leave the 988 but label it differently
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
so that it includes eating disorder ERS
 
05:24:03.230 --> 05:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
because they will that's part of what
 
05:24:06.390 --> 05:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
they do is if it's an eating disorder
 
05:24:09.910 --> 05:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
they send them to that they redirect
 
05:24:13.430 --> 05:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
them to I think somebody had said to
 
05:24:17.230 --> 05:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
that very place that that would go and
 
05:24:20.430 --> 05:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
what does do you still have your
 
05:24:22.708 --> 05:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
card I do not have those on me at the
 
05:24:24.830 --> 05:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
moment oh do you remember what it said
 
05:24:27.868 --> 05:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
what the 988 was labeled as I believe
 
05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
it's the National Suicide Prevention
 
05:24:34.030 --> 05:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
hotline so if if we expanded
 
05:24:37.230 --> 05:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
that to something that would be more
 
05:24:39.470 --> 05:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
inclusive since they do deal with more
 
05:24:48.070 --> 05:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:51.470 --> 05:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
sense thank you Mr
 
05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
chair first of all I appreciate
 
05:24:57.350 --> 05:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative lakes's effort to find a
 
05:25:03.190 --> 05:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
people with eating disorders experience
 
05:25:09.670 --> 05:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:16.948 --> 05:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:19.548 --> 05:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
information when they are near the
 
05:25:22.548 --> 05:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
bottom but they're not usually suicidal
 
05:25:27.030 --> 05:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's suicide by slow deaths starvation
 
05:25:30.788 --> 05:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
or very high incidents of heart attacks
 
05:25:34.030 --> 05:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
in people who are bulimic and they are
 
05:25:36.910 --> 05:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
often fatal that's not suicide per se
 
05:25:40.430 --> 05:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't call 988 for
 
05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
that early treatment works more
 
05:25:47.470 --> 05:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
successfully and that's what this
 
05:25:51.910 --> 05:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
Endeavors to help students
 
05:25:51.920 --> 05:25:54.270 align:start position:0%
Endeavors to help students
get

05:25:54.270 --> 05:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:25:58.150 --> 05:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
I would vigorously push back against a
 
05:26:02.708 --> 05:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:04.830 --> 05:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
evaluating the perspective and
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
information provided by the National
 
05:26:09.830 --> 05:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
Alliance for eating
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
disorders if those folks are not do not
 
05:26:15.390 --> 05:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
have expertise in this
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
field as you all know I spent 40 years
 
05:26:19.788 --> 05:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:26:22.868 --> 05:26:22.878 align:start position:0%
field body positivity Health at every
 
05:26:26.590 --> 05:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
size self-love non- dieting are
 
05:26:30.190 --> 05:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
fundamental premises of what works that
 
05:26:32.110 --> 05:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
isn't the the same thing as saying what
 
05:26:34.390 --> 05:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
you put in your body doesn't matter it's
 
05:26:37.230 --> 05:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
not saying nutrition isn't important it
 
05:26:39.750 --> 05:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
is but you have to get a person to a
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
place where they can trust themselves to
 
05:26:45.510 --> 05:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
make decisions to eat to retain what
 
05:26:45.520 --> 05:26:47.150 align:start position:0%
make decisions to eat to retain what
they

05:26:47.150 --> 05:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:26:50.270 --> 05:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
eat to learn what a reasonable
 
05:26:53.390 --> 05:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
relationship with food is and in order
 
05:26:56.070 --> 05:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
to do that they need to get help in a
 
05:26:57.310 --> 05:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
way that
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
feels trustworthy to them
 
05:27:04.548 --> 05:27:04.558 align:start position:0%
I would also reiterate I believe it was
 
05:27:06.628 --> 05:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
representative Myer who noted the value
 
05:27:10.190 --> 05:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
of the helpline to people besides the
 
05:27:12.510 --> 05:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
person with the eating
 
05:27:16.548 --> 05:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
disorder so I vigorously urge you to
 
05:27:20.430 --> 05:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
defeat the IDE itl pass n OTP and let's
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:29.520 --> 05:27:36.030 align:start position:0%
 
done

05:27:36.030 --> 05:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:39.030 --> 05:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I know very much about this
 
05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
this subject uh not because I really
 
05:27:45.030 --> 05:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to have to learn about it
 
05:27:50.868 --> 05:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:50.878 --> 05:27:52.548 align:start position:0%
 
challenge

05:27:52.548 --> 05:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
05:27:55.788 --> 05:27:55.798 align:start position:0%
panic and then they go underground as
 
05:27:59.548 --> 05:27:59.558 align:start position:0%
our colleague has said they hide it you
 
05:28:03.948 --> 05:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
don't find out until much later if ever
 
05:28:06.390 --> 05:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
what the sum of the sources
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
were it's it's so complex that as a
 
05:28:12.990 --> 05:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
parent you're just
 
05:28:17.110 --> 05:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
mystified and families break apart over
 
05:28:21.750 --> 05:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
this issue I'm not exaggerating one
 
05:28:26.670 --> 05:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
iota they do it wrecks families and the
 
05:28:30.628 --> 05:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
hardest single thing to do when you
 
05:28:35.150 --> 05:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
first encounter it is to get the person
 
05:28:39.708 --> 05:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
Afflicted to admit they need
 
05:28:42.270 --> 05:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
help that's all that's the single
 
05:28:47.430 --> 05:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:51.350 --> 05:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
therapist and they deny it and you find
 
05:28:53.670 --> 05:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
out that maybe there are other people in
 
05:28:56.350 --> 05:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
their Circle who are obsessed with
 
05:28:59.628 --> 05:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
weight or diet or something like that
 
05:29:02.310 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
and you find out it's not an isolated
 
05:29:05.788 --> 05:29:05.798 align:start position:0%
thing and how do you get them to turn
 
05:29:07.750 --> 05:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
the corner to
 
05:29:11.868 --> 05:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
say maybe I do maybe I need to look at
 
05:29:14.948 --> 05:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
this and one of the ways you can do it
 
05:29:18.708 --> 05:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
is to find someone that they will agree
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
to just ask it's all you're asking
 
05:29:23.150 --> 05:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
that's all you're
 
05:29:25.670 --> 05:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
praying just
 
05:29:29.030 --> 05:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
ask and if it means you how do you
 
05:29:30.548 --> 05:29:30.558 align:start position:0%
convince them because they say say you
 
05:29:32.510 --> 05:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
don't know what you're talking about if
 
05:29:34.350 --> 05:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
you're a
 
05:29:38.548 --> 05:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
parent and one of the ways it's only one
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
but why leave any Lo stone unturned in
 
05:29:44.830 --> 05:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
this is that they can find a source that
 
05:29:49.628 --> 05:29:49.638 align:start position:0%
says you can talk about this check in
 
05:29:51.150 --> 05:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
this is a real
 
05:29:53.788 --> 05:29:53.798 align:start position:0%
concern it's not
 
05:29:56.230 --> 05:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
fake then maybe that's not what their
 
05:29:58.150 --> 05:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
friend is telling them maybe that's not
 
05:29:59.830 --> 05:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
what they're believe it or not their
 
05:30:03.230 --> 05:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
friend mother who is obsessed about
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:10.150 --> 05:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
them that's a real example I just gave
 
05:30:13.750 --> 05:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
you so when one of your children's
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
Mother's friend's mother is advocating
 
05:30:21.948 --> 05:30:21.958 align:start position:0%
it you got an uphill swim you really
 
05:30:24.830 --> 05:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
do and so then you have to say how do I
 
05:30:27.150 --> 05:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
get that how do I break this cycle how
 
05:30:31.150 --> 05:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
do I help them break this cycle and one
 
05:30:32.948 --> 05:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
way is having a source that sits there
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
and says we can talk about
 
05:30:38.070 --> 05:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
this and once you get them to talk about
 
05:30:41.230 --> 05:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
it you can get them to
 
05:30:46.030 --> 05:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:48.670 --> 05:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
before thank you Mr chairman yeah just
 
05:30:50.470 --> 05:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
want to point out that in the the two
 
05:30:53.430 --> 05:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
years since you had the showed us the ID
 
05:30:55.150 --> 05:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
basically that's when the national
 
05:30:58.150 --> 05:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
change in 988 went from a suicide line
 
05:31:01.270 --> 05:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
to a suicide and crisis line um also
 
05:31:03.670 --> 05:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
mental health emergencies which we know
 
05:31:06.390 --> 05:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
are many times associated with all these
 
05:31:09.070 --> 05:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
things that people call hotlines for um
 
05:31:11.990 --> 05:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I want to reiterate what um
 
05:31:14.390 --> 05:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Lea said that it's really
 
05:31:17.270 --> 05:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
nice maybe maybe representative Corell
 
05:31:21.470 --> 05:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
it is nice to have a human voice answer
 
05:31:23.788 --> 05:31:23.798 align:start position:0%
the phone and I just know one number
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:29.160 --> 05:31:32.350 align:start position:0%
 
time

05:31:32.350 --> 05:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:35.150 --> 05:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
would you have a suggestion then since
 
05:31:38.590 --> 05:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
it's more than just the suicide hotline
 
05:31:41.310 --> 05:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
for what to call that number that would
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:51.150 --> 05:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
it I think that the the number that it
 
05:31:54.030 --> 05:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
says was is suicide and crisis line but
 
05:31:56.750 --> 05:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
it if you have any line afterwards which
 
05:32:00.548 --> 05:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
is any emergency gets you know a human
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
to person to direct your call so what
 
05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
would happen then if somebody were
 
05:32:07.080 --> 05:32:08.750 align:start position:0%
would happen then if somebody were
calling

05:32:08.750 --> 05:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
calling
 
05:32:08.760 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
calling
for

05:32:09.840 --> 05:32:09.850 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:32:09.850 --> 05:32:11.070 align:start position:0%
for
[Music]

05:32:11.070 --> 05:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
um uh eating disorder and they reached
 
05:32:18.270 --> 05:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
988 what would what does 988 do on the
 
05:32:21.390 --> 05:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
other end um I'm assuming and don't know
 
05:32:24.628 --> 05:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
this but I that they have protocol for
 
05:32:27.510 --> 05:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
triaging which what kind of what's your
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
like 911 what's your emergency yes 988
 
05:32:32.470 --> 05:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
what are you calling about and here's
 
05:32:33.910 --> 05:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
where it is because they know they're an
 
05:32:36.868 --> 05:32:36.878 align:start position:0%
after hours
 
05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
um uh number and so there's going to be
 
05:32:40.670 --> 05:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
different things that people are going
 
05:32:42.070 --> 05:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
to be calling them
 
05:32:45.750 --> 05:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
for would it be possible to do a little
 
05:32:49.150 --> 05:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
more looking into this and maybe bring
 
05:32:53.030 --> 05:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
this bill back with maybe a different
 
05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
solution that had somebody at the end
 
05:32:56.910 --> 05:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
the whole time that because that's my
 
05:32:59.030 --> 05:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
biggest concern is that there's not
 
05:33:00.510 --> 05:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a person
 
05:33:07.110 --> 05:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:10.548 --> 05:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
call um when you call to get some
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
help for
 
05:33:16.230 --> 05:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
someone and Emergency Services show up
 
05:33:18.868 --> 05:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
often times they're taken to the
 
05:33:21.548 --> 05:33:21.558 align:start position:0%
hospital the next day they're
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
out and whether it's for substance abuse
 
05:33:26.310 --> 05:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
or probably eating
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
disorder what kind of
 
05:33:31.788 --> 05:33:31.798 align:start position:0%
followup is going to happen when you
 
05:33:34.590 --> 05:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
call the eating disorder the national
 
05:33:37.788 --> 05:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
helpl line here that we have how do you
 
05:33:41.430 --> 05:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
get this followup and I can tell you
 
05:33:43.708 --> 05:33:43.718 align:start position:0%
right now there is no
 
05:33:46.910 --> 05:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
followup in the hospital in St Johnsbury
 
05:33:48.910 --> 05:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
there's no followup at Cottage Hospital
 
05:33:51.070 --> 05:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
in Woodsville there's no followup at
 
05:33:51.080 --> 05:33:53.230 align:start position:0%
in Woodsville there's no followup at
Dartmouth

05:33:53.230 --> 05:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth
 
05:33:57.430 --> 05:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock so what's the deal here is
 
05:33:59.350 --> 05:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
there going to be more followup with the
 
05:34:01.110 --> 05:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
the helpline
 
05:34:03.030 --> 05:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's just something I put
 
05:34:03.040 --> 05:34:04.990 align:start position:0%
you know it's just something I put
outon

05:34:04.990 --> 05:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
outon
 
05:34:08.830 --> 05:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
Damon so I'll try to address that
 
05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
and would first of all absolutely agree
 
05:34:14.990 --> 05:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
with you that Medical Center care for
 
05:34:16.670 --> 05:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
eating disorders is about physically
 
05:34:18.670 --> 05:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
stabilizing the person if in fact they
 
05:34:21.628 --> 05:34:21.638 align:start position:0%
are in a medical crisis like their
 
05:34:24.030 --> 05:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
electrolytes might be really low they'll
 
05:34:26.150 --> 05:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
have an IV and get their electrolytes
 
05:34:30.430 --> 05:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
restored um but it's very shortterm
 
05:34:31.708 --> 05:34:31.718 align:start position:0%
and it
 
05:34:35.628 --> 05:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
is I would say almost
 
05:34:38.230 --> 05:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
always especially in our small rural
 
05:34:40.910 --> 05:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals but even Dartmouth Dartmouth
 
05:34:42.990 --> 05:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
disbanded their eating disorder
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
treatment um
 
05:34:47.590 --> 05:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
unit gosh I don't even know how long ago
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
25 years ago a long time
 
05:34:54.470 --> 05:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
ago in most medical
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
centers it's emergency room triage
 
05:34:59.470 --> 05:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
they're not even necessarily admitted
 
05:35:02.750 --> 05:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
and they're not people who are expert in
 
05:35:04.590 --> 05:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
the mental health aspects of Eating
 
05:35:08.110 --> 05:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
Disorders they're expert at um helping
 
05:35:11.350 --> 05:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
that people's person stay alive so that
 
05:35:13.470 --> 05:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
they are physically restored a little
 
05:35:16.510 --> 05:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
bit um it's a serious problem in the
 
05:35:21.390 --> 05:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
field that needs a lot of education and
 
05:35:23.628 --> 05:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
work my understanding is that the
 
05:35:25.110 --> 05:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
alliance will
 
05:35:30.030 --> 05:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
both provide local contact resources so
 
05:35:31.830 --> 05:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
for example here we have the center for
 
05:35:31.840 --> 05:35:32.830 align:start position:0%
for example here we have the center for
eating

05:35:32.830 --> 05:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
eating
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
disorders um cedc which is in conquered
 
05:35:40.670 --> 05:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
um their um initial site is in Cambridge
 
05:35:42.390 --> 05:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
Mass but they've had a satellite
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
satellite site here for a long time very
 
05:35:47.548 --> 05:35:47.558 align:start position:0%
capable caring trained
 
05:35:49.788 --> 05:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
professionals that's largely where the
 
05:35:52.628 --> 05:35:52.638 align:start position:0%
alliance would refer people cedc would
 
05:35:53.750 --> 05:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
do an
 
05:35:57.510 --> 05:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation um and then help that person
 
05:36:00.070 --> 05:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
know what resources were available for
 
05:36:02.310 --> 05:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
them locally in terms of therapy
 
05:36:04.150 --> 05:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
dietitians knowledgeable medical
 
05:36:06.750 --> 05:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
providers or if they were at a level of
 
05:36:10.150 --> 05:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
risk that they needed a full day
 
05:36:11.990 --> 05:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
treatment program or Residential Care to
 
05:36:15.230 --> 05:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
help them access that CDC
 
05:36:20.070 --> 05:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
does 3 six 3 hour 6 hour and I think
 
05:36:21.910 --> 05:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
maybe they now have a longer hour per
 
05:36:23.390 --> 05:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
day than that here in conqur but they
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't have Residential Care here vast
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
majority of people with eating disorders
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't need residential care as long as
 
05:36:30.990 --> 05:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're diagnosed and treated
 
05:36:34.350 --> 05:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
sooner um
 
05:36:36.868 --> 05:36:36.878 align:start position:0%
so my understanding of the alliance
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
Services is they will make sure that
 
05:36:40.470 --> 05:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
that person is connected
 
05:36:44.708 --> 05:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
with human beings trained capable
 
05:36:46.948 --> 05:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
Professionals in their
 
05:36:51.150 --> 05:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
geography and or there is a lot of
 
05:36:54.868 --> 05:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
access to care online since Co we have
 
05:36:58.230 --> 05:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
really learned that you can actually do
 
05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
very effective very helpful
 
05:37:05.150 --> 05:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
care remotely and it's made access
 
05:37:08.548 --> 05:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
to very experienced very capable field
 
05:37:11.470 --> 05:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
people in the field much more accessible
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
because there's not enough people in
 
05:37:16.310 --> 05:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
every zip code in the country or in New
 
05:37:20.470 --> 05:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so one of those um approaches
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
I feel very confident that the ball will
 
05:37:26.070 --> 05:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
not be dropped for a particular person
 
05:37:26.080 --> 05:37:27.030 align:start position:0%
not be dropped for a particular person
it's

05:37:27.030 --> 05:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:37:29.788 --> 05:37:29.798 align:start position:0%
not 15-year-old Jane Doe called the
 
05:37:32.030 --> 05:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
alliance had a conversation and that was
 
05:37:35.190 --> 05:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
the end of it they will follow
 
05:37:40.830 --> 05:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
up further representative pel thank
 
05:37:44.350 --> 05:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
you we certainly want to be on top of
 
05:37:47.350 --> 05:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
helping people as quickly as
 
05:37:49.830 --> 05:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
possible and I was very active in
 
05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
finding the problems with the bot on the
 
05:37:56.948 --> 05:37:56.958 align:start position:0%
um on the on the eating disorder hotline
 
05:37:56.958 --> 05:37:58.510 align:start position:0%
um on the on the eating disorder hotline
last

05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:38:02.708 --> 05:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
year 15 days before the
 
05:38:05.548 --> 05:38:05.558 align:start position:0%
current law requiring the National
 
05:38:08.510 --> 05:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention Lifeline be put on
 
05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
the cards the name has already changed
 
05:38:13.868 --> 05:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
on that suicide Lifeline as
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative dry said it is now the um
 
05:38:18.750 --> 05:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
suicide and crisis
 
05:38:21.510 --> 05:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
Lifeline we've already gotten testimony
 
05:38:24.270 --> 05:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
that well we've got received express
 
05:38:27.788 --> 05:38:27.798 align:start position:0%
mail that the National Alliance for
 
05:38:30.350 --> 05:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
eating disorders intends to to expand
 
05:38:34.750 --> 05:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
their hours my concern is that at the
 
05:38:37.910 --> 05:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
rate that we move in the legislature we
 
05:38:40.110 --> 05:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
will not be able to keep up with helping
 
05:38:42.110 --> 05:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
these people fast enough and I'm
 
05:38:44.628 --> 05:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
wondering if there is a better way than
 
05:38:47.548 --> 05:38:47.558 align:start position:0%
trying to trace this with legislation to
 
05:38:49.030 --> 05:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that these people get the help
 
05:38:50.030 --> 05:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
that they
 
05:38:52.190 --> 05:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
need refes Cornell did you have your
 
05:38:54.390 --> 05:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
hand up or I was just wondering if we
 
05:38:57.910 --> 05:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
know that if they call 988 which triage
 
05:39:00.110 --> 05:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
is they don't say
 
05:39:02.350 --> 05:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
are you in crisis and if they say no I'm
 
05:39:04.030 --> 05:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
looking for someone to talk to I have a
 
05:39:06.628 --> 05:39:06.638 align:start position:0%
lot of questions they don't say this is
 
05:39:09.270 --> 05:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
the number for the national eating
 
05:39:13.468 --> 05:39:13.478 align:start position:0%
disorder um line um you should call them
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we don't know that you know so
 
05:39:19.948 --> 05:39:19.958 align:start position:0%
if it's not a crisis and they call 988
 
05:39:22.110 --> 05:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
we don't know that they don't revert if
 
05:39:24.110 --> 05:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
they triage we don't know that they
 
05:39:27.510 --> 05:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't revert them refer them to
 
05:39:27.520 --> 05:39:28.430 align:start position:0%
don't revert them refer them to
something

05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:39:28.440 --> 05:39:30.948 align:start position:0%
something
else

05:39:30.948 --> 05:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
else
 
05:39:30.958 --> 05:39:32.150 align:start position:0%
else
represent

05:39:32.150 --> 05:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:39:34.948 --> 05:39:34.958 align:start position:0%
R yeah and in a Twist of irony if you
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
call after hours at the alliance they'll
 
05:39:40.350 --> 05:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
say call 988 so I don't know if we're
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
going in a in a loop there or not i' I'd
 
05:39:44.830 --> 05:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
hesitate to speak for them now because
 
05:39:46.750 --> 05:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
really need to investigate that more
 
05:39:48.628 --> 05:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
before I can make an answer but I do
 
05:39:50.510 --> 05:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
know that they are you know when you
 
05:39:53.670 --> 05:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
open it up to Mental Health crisis that
 
05:39:56.110 --> 05:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
that runs the gamut and if you're a
 
05:39:58.230 --> 05:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
trained dispatcher you know with
 
05:39:59.868 --> 05:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
somebody's in crisis but you also know
 
05:40:01.868 --> 05:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
if they're not in crisis but needing
 
05:40:04.628 --> 05:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
help and this is really um I went
 
05:40:08.190 --> 05:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
through helping pass out plantlets uh in
 
05:40:11.310 --> 05:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County when the change came um
 
05:40:13.270 --> 05:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
to allow people to know that there was a
 
05:40:15.670 --> 05:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
change in services in 988 and that they
 
05:40:18.110 --> 05:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
had expanded things and the desire there
 
05:40:21.190 --> 05:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
is not to involve EMS police and
 
05:40:23.190 --> 05:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
ambulances unless it's absolutely
 
05:40:24.910 --> 05:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
necessary that people actually respond
 
05:40:26.910 --> 05:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
better when there's different kinds of
 
05:40:28.990 --> 05:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
coverage for an emergency like that and
 
05:40:30.670 --> 05:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
that was part of the reason for for
 
05:40:33.150 --> 05:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
changing this number um but I would
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
hesitate to speak for them unless I
 
05:40:36.548 --> 05:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
really talk to them to to understand
 
05:40:39.990 --> 05:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
that represent leus that's why I was
 
05:40:41.910 --> 05:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could wait like till
 
05:40:44.948 --> 05:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
next week to make a decision which would
 
05:40:48.230 --> 05:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
give us time to actually call 988 and
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
ask them how they would deal with this
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
and so we have answers to that to try to
 
05:40:56.590 --> 05:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
figure out what is the best thing to do
 
05:40:59.350 --> 05:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
because we all want to help these kids
 
05:40:59.360 --> 05:41:00.910 align:start position:0%
because we all want to help these kids
or

05:41:00.910 --> 05:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:41:05.468 --> 05:41:05.478 align:start position:0%
adults further representative
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
Tanner I don't want to be labor the
 
05:41:10.948 --> 05:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
point but 998 went through some changes
 
05:41:13.230 --> 05:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
too um
 
05:41:18.830 --> 05:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
and what is the harm versus what is the
 
05:41:21.788 --> 05:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
good that would come out of putting the
 
05:41:24.590 --> 05:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders number on that
 
05:41:28.628 --> 05:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
card does it harm 988 does it does it
 
05:41:29.788 --> 05:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
make a
 
05:41:31.750 --> 05:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
that much of a I mean does it make some
 
05:41:34.390 --> 05:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
sort of difference or does it give a
 
05:41:40.468 --> 05:41:40.478 align:start position:0%
benefit to kids to parents perhaps um to
 
05:41:43.628 --> 05:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
families um so I think in your own mind
 
05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
if you just kind of weigh the risk
 
05:41:48.548 --> 05:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
management kind of thing on this that
 
05:41:50.788 --> 05:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
yes 988 is on there it's always going to
 
05:41:52.270 --> 05:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
be on there they're not going to type
 
05:41:55.590 --> 05:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders over the top of 988 988
 
05:41:58.190 --> 05:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
is a crisis and suicide number like I
 
05:42:00.350 --> 05:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
said it it had its own problems a few
 
05:42:01.948 --> 05:42:01.958 align:start position:0%
years ago as well as it went through
 
05:42:03.990 --> 05:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
some changes and
 
05:42:06.150 --> 05:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
funding we now have this Eating
 
05:42:08.788 --> 05:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
Disorders number we now have more
 
05:42:11.150 --> 05:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
information about the seating disorders
 
05:42:14.708 --> 05:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
number what's the risk here the to save
 
05:42:18.750 --> 05:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of lives so I urge you to vote
 
05:42:21.548 --> 05:42:21.558 align:start position:0%
um against the itl thank
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
05:42:25.628 --> 05:42:25.638 align:start position:0%
pel sorry
 
05:42:30.190 --> 05:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
I'm the risk is that the line the name
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
of the line for the National Suicide
 
05:42:34.830 --> 05:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
Prevention has changed now it includes
 
05:42:37.868 --> 05:42:37.878 align:start position:0%
crisis so now we do not have that on the
 
05:42:40.150 --> 05:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
back of the student ID cards so we are
 
05:42:42.070 --> 05:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
missing a significant portion of the
 
05:42:43.670 --> 05:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
population that could be receiving the
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
mental health care that they need
 
05:42:48.230 --> 05:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
because in legislation law which moves
 
05:42:50.548 --> 05:42:50.558 align:start position:0%
very very slowly we're already two years
 
05:42:52.670 --> 05:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
behind we need to change the name on the
 
05:42:52.680 --> 05:42:54.150 align:start position:0%
behind we need to change the name on the
ID

05:42:54.150 --> 05:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
ID
 
05:42:57.628 --> 05:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
cards we're going to lose people or
 
05:42:59.390 --> 05:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
unintentionally harm the people people
 
05:43:02.750 --> 05:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
we intend to help further discussion
 
05:43:06.270 --> 05:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
represent cordel yes um the harm as I
 
05:43:10.270 --> 05:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
see it is that if a student calls this
 
05:43:12.510 --> 05:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
number and what what do they get a
 
05:43:14.628 --> 05:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
record if it's not during the hours of
 
05:43:17.830 --> 05:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
operation but you know are they put into
 
05:43:19.510 --> 05:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of phone Loop and I I just
 
05:43:22.270 --> 05:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
feel like that would be um harmful I
 
05:43:23.590 --> 05:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
just had to say
 
05:43:26.830 --> 05:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
05:43:30.548 --> 05:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
Damon so if I'm hearing correct ly we
 
05:43:34.510 --> 05:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
are having debate about will we harm
 
05:43:36.750 --> 05:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
someone who calls and doesn't get a live
 
05:43:39.868 --> 05:43:39.878 align:start position:0%
person and therefore we won't make this
 
05:43:42.310 --> 05:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
communicated and readily available 12
 
05:43:44.868 --> 05:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
hours a day to the people who would be
 
05:43:47.150 --> 05:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
helped by the folks who are most expert
 
05:43:51.468 --> 05:43:51.478 align:start position:0%
at this that makes no sense to me at all
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
I would also note representative dr's
 
05:43:57.590 --> 05:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
good explanation relative to the 988
 
05:44:00.350 --> 05:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
number that people respond better to
 
05:44:03.190 --> 05:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
care that is not the sirens and the
 
05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance unless it's a a crisis that
 
05:44:08.750 --> 05:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
requires that this is the same concept
 
05:44:11.190 --> 05:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
people respond better to the people who
 
05:44:14.750 --> 05:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
know best how to help them and that's
 
05:44:16.830 --> 05:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
what this
 
05:44:20.830 --> 05:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:26.230 --> 05:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
that can we no we Hammer this out can we
 
05:44:27.670 --> 05:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
put an
 
05:44:31.310 --> 05:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
amendment no we beyond amendments for
 
05:44:35.270 --> 05:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
be not just for to not for today right
 
05:44:43.830 --> 05:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
the question is could we do this hotline
 
05:44:47.310 --> 05:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
but also while we're at it
 
05:44:50.150 --> 05:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
relabel the one that we already did
 
05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
because that would not completely be
 
05:44:57.270 --> 05:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
an uh a what is the word I want non-
 
05:44:59.590 --> 05:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
gerain amendment that we could take this
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:11.910 --> 05:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
the okay we could do it here this isn't
 
05:45:14.270 --> 05:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
an early
 
05:45:17.788 --> 05:45:17.798 align:start position:0%
Bill represent Ford you the last one she
 
05:45:20.548 --> 05:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
look like something say oh rep
 
05:45:23.190 --> 05:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
cascaden you youve already spoken let
 
05:45:25.110 --> 05:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
represent cascad you haven't drilled in
 
05:45:28.310 --> 05:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
on this one yet go ahead then represent
 
05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
Ford that'll be it you know what I'm
 
05:45:34.510 --> 05:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
thinking in hindsight um I think the
 
05:45:37.510 --> 05:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
idea of having the Eating Disorders
 
05:45:40.150 --> 05:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
number on the student
 
05:45:43.510 --> 05:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
card makes a statement whether the
 
05:45:46.110 --> 05:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
number Works whether it's not in service
 
05:45:50.468 --> 05:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
whatever but it says that we as a body
 
05:45:53.830 --> 05:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
recognize this is a serious
 
05:45:56.110 --> 05:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
problem and in listening to
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
representative dry I can see as I have
 
05:46:01.310 --> 05:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
have seen other things happen this way
 
05:46:04.708 --> 05:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
that because we're focusing on one issue
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
three four five years down the
 
05:46:09.708 --> 05:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
road there's going to be a different
 
05:46:12.590 --> 05:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
type of system and it may go to one
 
05:46:15.110 --> 05:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
number that triages to whatever the
 
05:46:17.430 --> 05:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
topic is but for
 
05:46:22.110 --> 05:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
now if we don't OTP this bill and get
 
05:46:24.510 --> 05:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
this on the books it means we're kicking
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
the can down the road and we need to
 
05:46:29.868 --> 05:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
focus and let the public know our
 
05:46:32.430 --> 05:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
constituents know that we recognize this
 
05:46:32.440 --> 05:46:33.390 align:start position:0%
constituents know that we recognize this
is

05:46:33.390 --> 05:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:46:35.670 --> 05:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
serious but I think down the road you're
 
05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
going to see because we want kids to
 
05:46:40.190 --> 05:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
access mental health we want them to
 
05:46:43.030 --> 05:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
access help for eating disorders we
 
05:46:45.708 --> 05:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
might want to have them access helped if
 
05:46:48.230 --> 05:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
they've experienced childhood trauma or
 
05:46:50.430 --> 05:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
if they're living in an abusive
 
05:46:53.750 --> 05:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
situation so I can see that the system
 
05:46:56.230 --> 05:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
for kids support will transition down
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
the road it's just not there yet but
 
05:47:01.270 --> 05:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm envisioning to
 
05:47:03.910 --> 05:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
happen representative
 
05:47:08.548 --> 05:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
Ford thank and thank you Mr chair in the
 
05:47:11.830 --> 05:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
same spirit I would encourage you not to
 
05:47:14.030 --> 05:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
think of a
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
solution there is no one
 
05:47:20.948 --> 05:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
solution it's a very broad problem and
 
05:47:24.750 --> 05:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
the solution is not going to be any one
 
05:47:27.430 --> 05:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
thing it's going to require us to
 
05:47:29.590 --> 05:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
encourage people through one way or
 
05:47:32.150 --> 05:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
another to include this in the health
 
05:47:35.110 --> 05:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum in the schools get it out in
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
the in the public by through letters of
 
05:47:41.868 --> 05:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
uh uh to the editor or whatever that
 
05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
this is an issue which the culture must
 
05:47:48.910 --> 05:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
address you see all the tv ads night
 
05:47:51.070 --> 05:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
after night after night about how to be
 
05:47:54.310 --> 05:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
skinny and how to over exercise how to
 
05:47:56.750 --> 05:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
do all those things which someone seems
 
05:47:59.590 --> 05:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
to think are desirable
 
05:48:01.830 --> 05:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
some of those people look pretty weird
 
05:48:04.948 --> 05:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
to me but
 
05:48:08.830 --> 05:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
nonetheless I can't in truth I they look
 
05:48:13.670 --> 05:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
strange but I'm call be that as it may
 
05:48:15.030 --> 05:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
are they
 
05:48:18.030 --> 05:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
healthy and so you look at kids get hit
 
05:48:19.750 --> 05:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
with all of this stuff more than we do
 
05:48:21.270 --> 05:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who walk around like
 
05:48:23.708 --> 05:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
that they even have an ad that says when
 
05:48:25.628 --> 05:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
the uncertain happens that the guy's
 
05:48:27.548 --> 05:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
walking into traffic not looking where
 
05:48:29.590 --> 05:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
he's going that that's not uncertain
 
05:48:32.788 --> 05:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
that's dead certain it's going to happen
 
05:48:34.548 --> 05:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
he's going to get hit by a car or a
 
05:48:37.150 --> 05:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
truck or something and
 
05:48:40.548 --> 05:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
so when the kids are exposed to all that
 
05:48:44.190 --> 05:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
I think we need to expose the opposite
 
05:48:46.750 --> 05:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
bring it out get it in the newspapers
 
05:48:48.910 --> 05:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
get it in all the talk shows and all the
 
05:48:51.548 --> 05:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
other wherever you have to go to get
 
05:48:55.468 --> 05:48:55.478 align:start position:0%
it but get the word out and I would say
 
05:48:58.590 --> 05:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
that let's don't think in terms of how
 
05:49:01.430 --> 05:49:01.440 align:start position:0%

here we have a clerk that's got a to get
 
05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:57.440 --> 06:05:13.150 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:05:13.150 --> 06:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:13.160 --> 06:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
called

06:05:13.990 --> 06:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
called
 
06:05:17.468 --> 06:05:17.478 align:start position:0%
988 and I
 
06:05:20.110 --> 06:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
said they come up as you know what kind
 
06:05:22.030 --> 06:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
of almost what your emergency how can I
 
06:05:24.190 --> 06:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
help you and I said here's the what
 
06:05:25.948 --> 06:05:25.958 align:start position:0%
here's the deal we're trying to talk in
 
06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
a committee about what to put on the
 
06:05:31.750 --> 06:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
back of a of an ID and I want to know um
 
06:05:33.510 --> 06:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
it it took me less than 30 seconds to
 
06:05:35.670 --> 06:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
talk to a real human being and they had
 
06:05:38.190 --> 06:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
a triage between was I a veteran or not
 
06:05:40.628 --> 06:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
and then then it was she was right there
 
06:05:42.110 --> 06:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
and I said what would you do if someone
 
06:05:45.390 --> 06:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
called with it with a problem uh not not
 
06:05:47.548 --> 06:05:47.558 align:start position:0%
a crisis not even suicide but just a
 
06:05:49.070 --> 06:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
problem with an eating disorder and she
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
said um well for one thing I would see
 
06:05:54.910 --> 06:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
what the moment is is this a crisis
 
06:05:56.510 --> 06:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
moment where they where what's their
 
06:05:58.510 --> 06:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
need right in the moment we talk through
 
06:06:01.910 --> 06:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
the moment um I said okay um not
 
06:06:04.350 --> 06:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
everyone feels like they're in a crisis
 
06:06:06.150 --> 06:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
because of this do you have resources to
 
06:06:08.468 --> 06:06:08.478 align:start position:0%
connect people do yes we have resources
 
06:06:11.030 --> 06:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
to do that do you have resources to
 
06:06:13.190 --> 06:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
counselors yes we have resources to
 
06:06:15.628 --> 06:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
counselors um would it you know would it
 
06:06:17.150 --> 06:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
throw you off it it wasn't eating the
 
06:06:20.750 --> 06:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
disorder no not at all um what else did
 
06:06:25.510 --> 06:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
they say she said what we feel is people
 
06:06:28.110 --> 06:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
need to talk to human being and that's
 
06:06:29.868 --> 06:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
what they capture in the moment when
 
06:06:31.948 --> 06:06:31.958 align:start position:0%
they call they have a person who's a
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
counselor who's ready who's who answers
 
06:06:36.868 --> 06:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
the phone to talk to them and their idea
 
06:06:38.590 --> 06:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
there is then to sort out what is the
 
06:06:40.590 --> 06:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
need of this person sometimes it might
 
06:06:43.110 --> 06:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
be those mobile um mental health units
 
06:06:44.990 --> 06:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
that come that are not that don't bring
 
06:06:47.190 --> 06:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
lights and Sirens with them um sometimes
 
06:06:49.948 --> 06:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
it might just be reference and research
 
06:06:52.708 --> 06:06:52.718 align:start position:0%
and uh and referral and sometimes it
 
06:06:54.750 --> 06:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
might be sitting there and spending the
 
06:06:57.868 --> 06:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
time that that person needs to talk and
 
06:07:00.110 --> 06:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
I think I covered every question that I
 
06:07:02.468 --> 06:07:02.478 align:start position:0%
could think of um but they were very
 
06:07:05.868 --> 06:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:07.830 --> 06:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
06:07:12.110 --> 06:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
you okay is there any more discussion on
 
06:07:15.190 --> 06:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
this bill we had some discussion whether
 
06:07:17.468 --> 06:07:17.478 align:start position:0%
there should be an amendment put
 
06:07:22.270 --> 06:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:24.868 --> 06:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
penell at the very
 
06:07:27.270 --> 06:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
least this has brought our attention to
 
06:07:29.310 --> 06:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
the fact that we need to change what's
 
06:07:32.310 --> 06:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
on the back of the ID cards right now um
 
06:07:33.910 --> 06:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
so I
 
06:07:37.750 --> 06:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
would consider supporting this bill if
 
06:07:40.030 --> 06:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
we put forth an amendment that would
 
06:07:43.430 --> 06:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
also add changing what's currently back
 
06:07:45.270 --> 06:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
on the back of the student ID card to
 
06:07:45.280 --> 06:07:46.270 align:start position:0%
on the back of the student ID card to
the

06:07:46.270 --> 06:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:07:46.280 --> 06:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
the
correct

06:07:49.910 --> 06:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:53.430 --> 06:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
organization Mr chair yes uh could that
 
06:07:55.830 --> 06:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment be done in the
 
06:07:58.430 --> 06:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
Senate we spent a lot of time we spent a
 
06:08:00.190 --> 06:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
lot of time on this bill today yeah
 
06:08:01.948 --> 06:08:01.958 align:start position:0%
amendments can be made in the Senate we
 
06:08:05.110 --> 06:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
can do that in the Senate uh to address
 
06:08:08.788 --> 06:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
that it's an option represent
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
Tanner um so the person calls 988 like
 
06:08:16.990 --> 06:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
you said and they need somebody to talk
 
06:08:21.110 --> 06:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
to and this person is let's say a fearly
 
06:08:24.510 --> 06:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
experienced counselor probably received
 
06:08:27.310 --> 06:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
counsel probably received training
 
06:08:30.868 --> 06:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
on crisis management and suicide
 
06:08:35.390 --> 06:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
prevention it's not hard to think that
 
06:08:38.468 --> 06:08:38.478 align:start position:0%
in a conversation they could very well
 
06:08:41.350 --> 06:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
say something that is considered a
 
06:08:44.590 --> 06:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
trigger for an eating disorders person
 
06:08:47.670 --> 06:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
it happens I've heard it happen with
 
06:08:50.030 --> 06:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
EMTs picking up a litter and saying oh
 
06:08:52.390 --> 06:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
wow this is so light and it's like the
 
06:08:54.350 --> 06:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
last thing that they should have said to
 
06:08:56.270 --> 06:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
that particular person because it was a
 
06:09:00.030 --> 06:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
trigger for her eating disorder
 
06:09:04.070 --> 06:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
so once again I just want to say I don't
 
06:09:06.270 --> 06:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
think we need an amendment I think we
 
06:09:09.230 --> 06:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
need to vote on this bill because we
 
06:09:12.910 --> 06:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
need to to as representative Ford said
 
06:09:15.390 --> 06:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
bring this issue to the
 
06:09:15.400 --> 06:09:17.350 align:start position:0%
bring this issue to the
Forefront

06:09:17.350 --> 06:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
Forefront
 
06:09:20.788 --> 06:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
provide something that's easy for kids
 
06:09:23.670 --> 06:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
to see easy for parents to see that
 
06:09:27.750 --> 06:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
changes every year their IDE cords
 
06:09:31.110 --> 06:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
change every year so it isn't a really
 
06:09:34.948 --> 06:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
big deal on that you know I think if you
 
06:09:37.468 --> 06:09:37.478 align:start position:0%
want to vote against this vote against
 
06:09:40.350 --> 06:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
it but it it's going to save lives if
 
06:09:43.150 --> 06:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
you vote for this to put this on the ID
 
06:09:48.468 --> 06:09:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:50.708 --> 06:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
06:09:54.548 --> 06:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
pno thank you um I hear what you're
 
06:09:56.190 --> 06:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
saying representative Tanner and I hear
 
06:09:58.868 --> 06:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
what you're saying representative Myer
 
06:10:01.910 --> 06:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I just am concerned that we're
 
06:10:03.830 --> 06:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
already not helping as many people as we
 
06:10:05.750 --> 06:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
could because of the limited name on the
 
06:10:08.670 --> 06:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
back of the current ID card and I also
 
06:10:10.910 --> 06:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
have concerns with sending an amendment
 
06:10:13.190 --> 06:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate because I'm pretty
 
06:10:15.070 --> 06:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
sure I know what kind of a bill it would
 
06:10:19.390 --> 06:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
be added to and I probably would have to
 
06:10:20.948 --> 06:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
vote for something I might not want to
 
06:10:25.628 --> 06:10:25.638 align:start position:0%
support in order to get this ID name
 
06:10:25.638 --> 06:10:27.190 align:start position:0%
support in order to get this ID name
changed

06:10:27.190 --> 06:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
changed
 
06:10:30.548 --> 06:10:30.558 align:start position:0%
okay this is not an early Bill we don't
 
06:10:32.510 --> 06:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
have to really finish it out right now
 
06:10:34.230 --> 06:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
at this very moment if there's an
 
06:10:35.830 --> 06:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that's going to come forward
 
06:10:39.990 --> 06:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
and deal with what some are concerned
 
06:10:46.830 --> 06:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:50.190 --> 06:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
neon I would
 
06:10:52.788 --> 06:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
like I would like us to postpone this
 
06:10:54.788 --> 06:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
until tomorrow and I will bring forward
 
06:10:57.270 --> 06:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
the requested amendment to update the
 
06:10:59.708 --> 06:10:59.718 align:start position:0%
name so that hopefully we can
 
06:11:01.548 --> 06:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
efficiently vote on this
 
06:11:04.030 --> 06:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and I will trust that we are
 
06:11:07.430 --> 06:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
together with that I think what we're
 
06:11:10.990 --> 06:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
going to do is stop it right where we
 
06:11:13.030 --> 06:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
are and if somebody can try to get
 
06:11:15.070 --> 06:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
something we can deal with it tomorrow
 
06:11:16.830 --> 06:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
because it's on the docket for tomorrow
 
06:11:19.830 --> 06:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
as well and it can continue forward
 
06:11:21.990 --> 06:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
represent pel did you have something oh
 
06:11:23.468 --> 06:11:23.478 align:start position:0%

06:11:33.430 --> 06:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
please do so y yeah and so we will come
 
06:11:36.030 --> 06:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
back tomorrow this is we're done for
 
06:11:39.030 --> 06:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
today and we will we'll you know come
 
06:11:41.150 --> 06:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
forward and deal with this one tomorrow
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
good that'll give me a chance to find it
 
06:11:45.468 --> 06:11:45.478 align:start position:0%
