first on House Bill uh 67 relative to
 
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
the right to review source code of
 
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
software in criminal cases and is
 
00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher here yeah yes
 
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
um hello I'm Eric Gallagher
 
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh representing
 
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County district attorney
 
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
that's conquered
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
Ward 6.
 
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 align:start position:0%
down that way
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
um so I'm here to
 
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.309 align:start position:0%
um so I'm here to
introduce

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
House Bill 67 relative to the right to
 
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
review source code of software in
 
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
criminal cases so
 
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.289 align:start position:0%
criminal cases so
um

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
this this bill is part of
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
what last term
 
00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
uh I referred to as
 
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
the software act which was an acronym
 
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%
securing our freedom to write and read
 
00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
everything that was um how spill
 
00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
one two one nine or wait no no no it
 
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
wasn't hold on um it was
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
um one two seven three
 
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
last term
 
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.550 align:start position:0%
last term
um

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
um yeah it has will
 
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
uh 1273 last time was kind of a big
 
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.010 align:start position:0%
uh 1273 last time was kind of a big
omnibus

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
omnibus
 
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.450 align:start position:0%
omnibus
bill

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.350 align:start position:0%
bill
um

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
about securing software freedom
 
00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:42.469 align:start position:0%
in our state
um

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
and so that went before
 
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
Edna and part of their feedback they
 
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.730 align:start position:0%
Edna and part of their feedback they
gave

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
gave
 
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 align:start position:0%
um was that I was trying to do too much
 
00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
stuff in one bill
 
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
so I took that advice to heart and
 
00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
broke it up into
 
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
several smaller pieces so as a result
 
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
some of the pieces
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
are now going to separate committees
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
like this one
 
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
which is coming here to judiciary
 
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
so this one is pretty simple
 
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.969 align:start position:0%
so this one is pretty simple
um

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.030 align:start position:0%
it's just
about

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
the right to review source code
 
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.170 align:start position:0%
the right to review source code
and

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings so
 
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.790 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings so
um

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 align:start position:0%
as computers become more
 
00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 align:start position:0%
widespread they're used for more and
 
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
more purposes
 
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
such as DNA sequencing fingerprint
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
analysis video processing
 
00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.189 align:start position:0%
analysis video processing
so

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.270 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 align:start position:0%
important things in criminal cases is to
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
ensure that all the evidence is reliable
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
as possible to ensure that
 
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
we're making the right decisions based
 
00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
off of it so
 
00:05:58.979 --> 00:05:59.689 align:start position:0%
off of it so
um

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
the way to do that here would be to
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
provide a right to review source code of
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
software so this
 
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.070 align:start position:0%
software so this
um

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
would basically uh codify
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
a decision
 
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.749 align:start position:0%
a decision
um

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
by a New Jersey appeals court
 
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.409 align:start position:0%
by a New Jersey appeals court
um

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
so it was the case of Corey Pickett who
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
was in
 
00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
a Jersey City shooting in
 
00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 align:start position:0%
2017 uh
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
won the right to
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
examine the source code of a software
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
program called true allele to make sure
 
00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that the
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
DNA testing results that were being used
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
against him
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
in trial were accurate
 
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.490 align:start position:0%
in trial were accurate
um

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 align:start position:0%
so that's the
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
um there have also been some
 
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.409 align:start position:0%
um there have also been some
um

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
other court cases where it came to
 
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.450 align:start position:0%
other court cases where it came to
um

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:11.539 align:start position:0%
a similar result of
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
defendants having a right to examine uh
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
source code but that's just the um
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
first of them that I saw and um
 
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
the main one that I thought okay this is
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
yeah in the in this case
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
um it was
 
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.650 align:start position:0%
um it was
uh

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
proprietary program but
 
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.890 align:start position:0%
proprietary program but
um

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
um worried about oh this could be a
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
um were being asked to reveal uh the
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
source code of programs that aren't even
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
ours well that's all the more reason to
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
shift to
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
using free and open source
 
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
software programs
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
to generate evidence instead which
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
is where the source code is already
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
available and can have been examined
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
ahead of time
 
00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.390 align:start position:0%
ahead of time
um

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's the um
 
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
two main purposes here one for to sell
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
greater confidence that all evidence in
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
our cases is
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
reliable and to to encourage prosecutors
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
to use more free and open source
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
software and
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'll take any questions
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
all right questions from members of the
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Alexander
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you um uh
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher take my
 
00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:54.230 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher take my
question

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
um do you see like there could be a
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
security concern about this like
 
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
especially if we're revealing like a
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
bunch of State software
 
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
um and could it open up to Fabulous
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that's my question and would
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
you be open to maybe amending this to
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
um have you know the right to have an
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
independent review of the software as
 
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:13.019 align:start position:0%
opposed to having the defendant be able
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
to review every single
 
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
um piece of software that's used to
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
um prosecute them
 
00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:21.829 align:start position:0%
um prosecute them
um

00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:23.329 align:start position:0%
um
well

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
all right so that was two questions one
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
about security so
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
um first I'd like to um
 
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
remind people of the distinction between
 
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
data and code
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
um so there are actually a lot of Open
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
Source programs out there that store
 
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
private data and do so successfully
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they're open source
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
actually makes them more secure due to
 
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
what's known as The Many Eyes principle
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
the more people that look at the source
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
code of something the greater chance
 
00:09:59.769 --> 00:09:59.779 align:start position:0%
that though that a vulnerability will be
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
realized and fixed then if only a
 
00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:05.899 align:start position:0%
certain a select few number of people
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
are allowed to view it
 
00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:10.670 align:start position:0%
are allowed to view it
um

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.130 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's it's only about the code
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
not the data private data would remain
 
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.170 align:start position:0%
not the data private data would remain
private

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.850 align:start position:0%
private
um and

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
then ask for the second question
 
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
then ask for the second question
um about

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
um about
 
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.790 align:start position:0%
um about
um

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.630 align:start position:0%
um
requiring

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
pending it off to an independent party
 
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
to handle the review I guess I'd have to
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
how exactly the independent uh
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
party would be chosen and
 
00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
party would be chosen and
um

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
how they'd report their results and what
 
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
they'd publish
 
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.630 align:start position:0%
they'd publish
um

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds that sounds like it would add
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
some uh complexity to the bill uh the
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
current way it's written
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I kind of prefer due to the
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
Simplicity of it but um
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
if there is a
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
valid way to
 
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
set up
 
00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
and independent party to review the
 
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
I guess my concern is that how far would
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
we go with this
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
um and would you be willing to amend to
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps Define the scope a little bit
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
and you know slightly concerned that
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
this could potentially open up for every
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
single case for somebody to say you know
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
even in a misdemeanor case where
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
somebody was caught on camera stealing
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
something and then later confirmed you
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
know using cell phone software that they
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
were in fact at that location for them
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
to say well I want to see the source
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
code of the you know software from the
 
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
camera that was used or the security
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
system as well as Verizon source code
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
for how they pinpointed on the towers my
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
location and you know this would be a
 
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:20.579 align:start position:0%
minor case where the person had stolen
 
00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
you know maybe a hundred dollars worth
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
of stuff and it's only a misdemeanor and
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
maybe they're using a public defender
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then on both sides the prosecution
 
00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:29.459 align:start position:0%
and the defense then you know we're
 
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
funding for an expert witness
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
to review this source code so would you
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
be you know open to perhaps
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
defining the scope a little bit a little
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
bit further I I hear what you're saying
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
about the DNA piece and maybe some of
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
the pieces where that particular piece
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
of software is generally used by
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know government entities in order to
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
prosecute somebody but where something
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
is not typically used for that purpose
 
00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:58.700 align:start position:0%
and may be owned by a private company
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to amend a little
 
00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:03.050 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to amend a little
bit

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.230 align:start position:0%
um
well

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.910 align:start position:0%
well
um

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
so as far as the part about
 
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.509 align:start position:0%
so as far as the part about
um

00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
it being every single case
 
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.690 align:start position:0%
it being every single case
um

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
I guess I would be
 
00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:18.779 align:start position:0%
open to
 
00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:19.850 align:start position:0%
open to
um

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of repetitiveness limitation
 
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
like if somebody else
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
if some previous defendant has already
 
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.509 align:start position:0%
if some previous defendant has already
um

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
has already
 
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.050 align:start position:0%
has already
requested

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
requested
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
um a review of the exact same source
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
code then I think it should be possible
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
to just reuse that rather than doing a
 
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:41.339 align:start position:0%
new one
 
00:13:41.339 --> 00:13:42.410 align:start position:0%
new one
um

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
yeah I um
 
00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
that that would be the main one I'd be
 
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo I believe you had a question
 
00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
okay other questions yes representative
 
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Gallagher um I'm
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
just curious what the if you know what
 
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
the current status of
 
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.389 align:start position:0%
the current status of
um

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
this type of issue being raised is in
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
terms of can evidence currently be
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
questioned on this basis the the soft of
 
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
of suspected uh issues with the
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
underlying software and I guess sort of
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
the flip side of that
 
00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339 align:start position:0%
um if this were put in place is is it
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
your sense that there'd be the
 
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity to claim insufficient
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
defense or something like that if you're
 
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
if you're your defendant did wasn't able
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
to examine all the different software
 
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:47.540 align:start position:0%
that that was used
 
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.250 align:start position:0%
that that was used
so

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer uh I yeah I don't
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
practice law and
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
so um yeah I don't know if this is
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
something that lawyers have already been
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
trying to do in New Hampshire
 
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
specifically I'm mostly coming at this
 
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:03.769 align:start position:0%
specifically I'm mostly coming at this
from

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
the software perspective of
 
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.449 align:start position:0%
the software perspective of
um

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
just trying to
 
00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:12.470 align:start position:0%
just trying to
um

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
so yeah if um I I don't know about New
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I have seen other cases where
 
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.970 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I have seen other cases where
um the

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
like the um
 
00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:30.949 align:start position:0%
like the um
video

00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
video
 
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
like when where there was a video
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
recording of something and people were
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if it was doctored or not that
 
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
came into question but um
 
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not I'm not quite sure about
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
what the current stat is if that is
 
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.170 align:start position:0%
what the current stat is if that is
under

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.329 align:start position:0%
 
Jersey

00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
Jersey
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if you had the
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
citation to that case and that you could
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
provide to the committee and I think you
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are some other cases and
 
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
I would be interested in in Reading
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
those also if you have them
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah well I mean I have the URL
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I can email that to you
 
00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:20.810 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I can email that to you
um

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
exact like legal format citation but I
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
do have like a URL so
 
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:42.129 align:start position:0%
do have like a URL so
foreign

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:42.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
I do have a couple of questions yet
 
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.470 align:start position:0%
I do have a couple of questions yet
um

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
is um I guess what I'm wondering is why
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
why do we need a statute to deal with
 
00:16:57.889 --> 00:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
this why couldn't I mean presumably in
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
in cases that where there is some basis
 
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
to believe that there's something wrong
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
with the source code
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
the the judge would have the power to
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
order that in a particular case anyway
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't he
 
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.590 align:start position:0%
wouldn't he
um

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
I mean he or she I should say I mean I
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't know I think having it in statute
 
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.470 align:start position:0%
don't know I think having it in statute
would

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
Grant some greater clarity about whether
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
that is actually the case or not
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
um if it is then create then now now
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
we've at least said so explicitly so
 
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
that way people can know in the future
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay can I ask you it's a follow-up
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
question that the New Jersey case that
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
you referred to in that case
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
was there before the court ordered this
 
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
access to the source code was there
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
an allegation in the in that particular
 
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
case that there was
 
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
you know something was amiss
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
or did the court just say
 
00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
you know anytime a criminal defendant
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
wants the source code he or she can get
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
the source code
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'll I'll have to send you the
 
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.450 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'll I'll have to send you the
whole

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.350 align:start position:0%
whole
um

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
you are also
 
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.230 align:start position:0%
you are also
um

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
you can review it um but you know a
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
second you don't you you can't tell us
 
00:18:20.289 --> 00:18:20.299 align:start position:0%
now whether that whether there was some
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
basis in the particular case for the
 
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
judge ordering the source code
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a 74 page ruling here and um
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
yeah finding that and
 
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
the text of a ruling would be would take
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
more time than we have here I think okay
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much sir
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
keep turning off the mic Melissa Staples
 
00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:16.250 align:start position:0%
keep turning off the mic Melissa Staples
please

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.930 align:start position:0%

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Melissa Staples
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of the New Hampshire
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
State Police forensic laboratory and I'm
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
here testifying a post to this bill
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
we absolutely agree with the sponsor of
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
this bill that we want to ensure the
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
reliability of everything that we do and
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
this includes not just the software but
 
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
the instrumentation the Personnel
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
everything that we do in the laboratory
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
because we understand the stakes that
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
that are resulting from our work
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
the laboratory is accredited to ISO
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
17025 an international standard and we
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
also are bound by the FBI's quality
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
assurance standards for DNA Testing
 
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.890 align:start position:0%
assurance standards for DNA Testing
Laboratories

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
Laboratories
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
and all of these standards that we are
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
required to follow
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
involve extensive testing before any
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
process is used on an item of evidence
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
so this includes instrumentation it
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
includes Personnel it includes software
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
everything in the laboratory requires a
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
validation process where we test the
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
processor the new technique or the new
 
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
software in many different ways but one
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the most important ways I think is to
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
use known samples that have an expected
 
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.770 align:start position:0%
use known samples that have an expected
result

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
and if the software of the instrument is
 
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
not giving us that expected result we
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
need to figure out why is it because the
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
software is faulty is it because we're
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
doing something wrong but we want to
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
ensure in every instance that we're
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
getting the most reliable and accurate
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
result possible
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
oftentimes these samples that we use to
 
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
test the software and the
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
instrumentation are either mistraceable
 
00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:57.559 align:start position:0%
or certified reference standards
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
something of that nature where there is
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
a known result that we should be
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
obtaining each and every time and we
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
want to ensure that we're obtaining that
 
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.610 align:start position:0%
want to ensure that we're obtaining that
result

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:06.620 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
repeatedly we don't want to just do one
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
test and then we're good this is a very
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
extensive often a month-long process to
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
ensure that these things are working
 
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.950 align:start position:0%
ensure that these things are working
properly

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
in addition to that with every run that
 
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
we do with items of evidence we also
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
alongside the evidence have a control
 
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
sample which again is a sample with a
 
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
known outcome and so this will also tell
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
us if anything in our process including
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
software is providing us the correct
 
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
result and only after that control
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
sample gives us the correct result can
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
we go on and look at what the result
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
from the evidence is so we have built-in
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
insurances that the software or the
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
instrumentation is working properly
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
in addition to that on an annual basis
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
everybody in the laboratory undergoes
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
proficiency testing and this is a
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
process where an outside agency provides
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
us with unknown samples we don't know
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
what the results are if it's a white
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
powder we don't know what we're trying
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
to find out it could be heroin it could
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
be cocaine it could be fentanyl it could
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
be meth we don't know
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
but the Outside Agency does and so at
 
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
the end of our testing using our regular
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
processes we submit our results to the
 
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:18.419 align:start position:0%
Outside Agency and they tell us if we
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
got the right result or not
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
if we didn't get the right result we
 
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
want to go back and figure out what
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
happened is it an analyst error isn't
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
the instruments not working properly you
 
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
know what happened that we didn't get
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
the right result but essentially the
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
software in our processes are being
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
tested continuously throughout the year
 
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
not just at the very beginning when we
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
start to put it into use but
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
consistently and throughout its lifespan
 
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
because of all of these things I have a
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
great deal of confidence that our
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
software is working properly
 
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:51.419 align:start position:0%
the controls that I mentioned that are
 
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
run with every test are documented in
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
every case File which is discoverable to
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
the defense and so there is an
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review that all the
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
samples that we're supposed to give a
 
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
certain result did and to ensure that
 
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:07.340 align:start position:0%
everything was working properly
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
the many of the software that we use
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
there is no free and open source
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
software available for those purposes if
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
you can think of a free and open source
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
software that will allow us to bypass
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
passcodes on iPhones that'd be great
 
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
because I would love to not pay for
 
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
software to do that every year but the
 
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
point is many of these software are
 
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.270 align:start position:0%
point is many of these software are
proprietary

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
proprietary
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
and the bill does not give any
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
protections to these vendors with their
 
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
Source codes so that someone else could
 
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
not then you know steal that source code
 
00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:39.539 align:start position:0%
and the concern for the laboratory for
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
the state might be that some of these
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
vendors may say you know what this is
 
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
opening us up to someone else
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
essentially copying our software and
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
we're no longer going to do business
 
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
with the state and that would pretty
 
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
much bring the laboratory certainly to a
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
standstill because I'm sure you're aware
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
a software is ubiquitous today it's used
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
in almost everything we do and so
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
opening that up could have very
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
detrimental effects in a lot of areas in
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much I'm happy to take
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
any questions here any questions for our
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
members committee yes representative
 
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.190 align:start position:0%
members committee yes representative
Schmidt

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
um do you routinely check everything
 
00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:24.419 align:start position:0%
or is it only when the defendant or the
 
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
prosecutor in a criminal case asks you
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
to check we it's a consistent thing
 
00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:33.299 align:start position:0%
every every run we do every time we use
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
software we are checking with a known
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
sample to ensure it's working properly
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
so that's something that we want to
 
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
ensure happens all the time consistently
 
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
so it's not only when a defendant asks
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
we do our process no matter what no
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
matter who's asking for what we have
 
00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
these quality assurance processes in
 
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
place because of our accreditation and
 
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
because we want to do things right thank
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
you may I follow up yes absolutely um
 
00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
and uh in terms of your operation are
 
00:24:59.890 --> 00:24:59.900 align:start position:0%
you adequately
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
staffed and
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
um uh defined budgeted so that you can
 
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:10.700 align:start position:0%
respond in a timely way
 
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
understanding that Justice delayed is
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
but to
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
received and we do respond to those
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
typically our standard response is to
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
provide an entire copy of the case File
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
which includes the controls the results
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
of the controls that we run along with
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
our procedures are freely available as
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
well that's essentially our cookbook
 
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
that we use to test all of our evidence
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
so those are available so a lot of
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
things are available on Discovery freely
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
and openly from the laboratory
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
if you if you could just answer the last
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
part are how timely is your response
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
typically for a standard Discovery like
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
that typically within a week thank you
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome other questions
 
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Shelton welcome thank
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
you good morning my name is Jeff
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
strollsen I'm an associate attorney
 
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
general at the New Hampshire Attorney
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
General's office so I oversee the
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
criminal Bureau
 
00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:30.769 align:start position:0%
criminal Bureau
um

00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
could you spell your last name oh sure
 
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.830 align:start position:0%
could you spell your last name oh sure
it's

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
s-t-r-e-l-z-i-n thank you you're welcome
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh we're opposing this bill because we
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
think it's unnecessary there's already a
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
robust system in place in New Hampshire
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
that allows the parties to obtain
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
evidence and contest it for example we
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
have rules of criminal procedure in New
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically rule 12 that
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
allows the parties to make Discovery
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
requests which is request for
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
information from each other almost all
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
the time in criminal cases the parties
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
are able to work out these requests with
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
each other in the rare instance where
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
they can't agree the rule allows them to
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
file a motion with the court and then a
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
judge decides the issue and decides
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
um the discovery is necessary
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's also significant amount of case
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
that directly addresses the issue of the
 
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
reliability of evidence and generally
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
speaking lawyers call that Dal bear
 
00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
cases and what those cases do is they
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
set out the standards that judges
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
already use when they examine novel or
 
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
new scientific evidence and essentially
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
if a defendant raises an issue about
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
something that's novel or new the burden
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
is then on the state to show that that
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
evidence is reliable and that typically
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
involves experts depositions and
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
hearings before the court so we already
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
have extensive rules extensive case law
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that works extremely well
 
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
to address these types of issues which
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
is why we don't believe that a statute
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
mandating it in all cases is necessary
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
because the proposed bill would do away
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
with the system we already have that
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
works extremely well and it would allow
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
a defendant to ask for source code
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
without limitation
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
and that would apply to technology which
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
has been used for decades and for which
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no legitimate concern
 
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
about reliability that would obviously
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
cause a lot of delay a lot of expense
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
and again you've heard a little bit
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
about just some of the things this would
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
apply to it's ubiquitous if if
 
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
detectives sit down and do an interview
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
with somebody use the digital recorder
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
that uses software so that a defendant
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
would be able to contest that software
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
surveillance systems are everywhere in
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
businesses and personal homes people
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
have cameras on their doors cameras
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
outside all that runs on software a
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
defendant would then be able to make a
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
request and contest that cell phones
 
00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
obviously everybody has a cell phone not
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
just location data but also photographs
 
00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:03.539 align:start position:0%
things like that just even making calls
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
a defendant will be able to contest that
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
and finally just basic things for
 
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
instance in assault rape or murder cases
 
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
any medical testing that's done by a
 
00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
hospital including digital x-rays that
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
all runs on software that requires
 
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
source code so this would open the door
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
to testing in an unlimited basis and
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
right now a judge acts as the gatekeeper
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and decides does it
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
make sense whether to allow this type of
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
inquiry into scientific testing and
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
again we already have a robust set of
 
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
rules and our rules of chrome procedure
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
and case law that governs how that's
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
done so this is simply not necessary
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
another issue is that
 
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
um this would allow unlimited claims
 
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
throughout the state no matter how many
 
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
times this issue has already been
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
litigated so again that's going to slow
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
things down and cost a fair amount as
 
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.149 align:start position:0%
things down and cost a fair amount as
well

00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:57.299 align:start position:0%
one thing I would like to address is
 
00:29:59.529 --> 00:29:59.539 align:start position:0%
this the sponsor mentioned about
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
encouraging prosecutors I think to use
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
open software so prosecutors don't have
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
really any choice on what software we
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
use because this is evidence that's
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
coming from somewhere else we can't say
 
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
for instance to a private company you
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
need to do something with your Trade
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
Secrets or your cot you know copyrighted
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
materials we can't do that we either get
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
it or we don't and so I took a quick
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
look at that New Jersey case that was
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned one of the reasons that the
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
company in that case objected was
 
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
because the private company it's Trade
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
Secrets and the solution was that the
 
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
material was provided into what's called
 
00:30:36.889 --> 00:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
a protective order meaning the judge
 
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
ordered that that material is provided
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
but the parties are limited in how they
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
can use it and how they can share it and
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
so those are the types of things that
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
judges can do in these cases to craft a
 
00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
remedy that satisfies the private
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
company that's worried that all the work
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
they put into their software could just
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
go out to the other side but at the same
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
time honor the defendant's rights and
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
give the defendant what he or she needs
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
in a case and again our system works
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
extremely well it's set up to do that
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
but it's important for judges to be able
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
to hear from both sides consider the
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
facts of the case and decide what's
 
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate in that case in other words
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
a one-size-fits all doesn't work in
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
every case I think one representative
 
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
mentioned about for instance in
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor cases and so you might do
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
different things in different cases this
 
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
statute would take that away and again
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter if this is software
 
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539 align:start position:0%
that's been used for 30 or 40 years it
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
would make it would make the state
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
justify the use of that software even
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
though we don't have much choice in what
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
we use and we don't have control over
 
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
private companies and their software so
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
that's generally our objections to this
 
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone has questions for
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
members of the committee yes
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
it can if it if it meets the test of in
 
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
other words if somebody raises a claim
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
about its reliability and its novel
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence it very well could
 
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
and that's what happened in the New
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
Jersey cases true allele it's a it's a
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
new type of DNA testing
 
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.850 align:start position:0%
new type of DNA testing
um

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's been around actually for a while
 
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:21.380 align:start position:0%
and it's gaining more and more ground
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
but when it first came out it was brand
 
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
new private company and it hadn't been
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
tested before and that's why it was
 
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
getting litigated in these courts and I
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
did look at a few of the decisions and
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
the and the courts are saying yep you've
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
got to provide this software but we'll
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
protect it with these protective orders
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
because obviously the company spent
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars in
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
years uh putting this together you can
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
imagine if I reached out to Apple and
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
said I want your source code for for
 
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059 align:start position:0%
your phone they tell me to go pound sand
 
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
but there are ways I think that our
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
court rules and our decisions can
 
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
accommodate this and do
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr oh I'm sorry representative
 
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
De Lorenzo hey go Mr chair thank you for
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
taking my questions good morning good
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
morning when we talk about
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
um evidence and you know how it's
 
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
processed I have to think about the
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
Annie dukin case in from Massachusetts
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
that was the Massachusetts drug lab
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
Scandal where the chemists falsified 34
 
00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:24.419 align:start position:0%
000 drug tests
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
um does New Hampshire have protections
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
against that type of thing happening
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
so first of all that's not a software
 
00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
issue so that's not what this bill talks
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
about but generally speaking and answer
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
your question I know a little bit about
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
that case I think it goes to what
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
director Staples talked about which is
 
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
the system of checks and balances that
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
we have the other thing is that in New
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire practitioners in the criminal
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
side are pretty experienced and
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
most of us can take a look at stuff and
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
realize when something doesn't make
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
sense and then we can consult with other
 
00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
experts the defense does that as well so
 
00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
I do think the system of checks and
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
balances is pretty good in New Hampshire
 
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
um I certainly can't guarantee you that
 
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
a a single Rogue person can't happen but
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
again I think you heard from director
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
Staples about the checks and balances
 
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
and having a vigorous well-resourced
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
criminal bar in New Hampshire which
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
which we do in many ways helps protect
 
00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:22.339 align:start position:0%
the rights of defendants in that case
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely so if the chemist is
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
using software to analyze her
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
um you know the drugs that were seized
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
does that run into this law that we're
 
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419 align:start position:0%
looking at today
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
so this law would say that no matter how
 
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
long that software had been around no
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
matter how well tested it was no matter
 
00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
how reliable it's already been
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
established a defendant could challenge
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
it in every single case
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome other questions
 
00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:53.099 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you Mr
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
Shelton thank you for your questions and
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
let me testify I appreciate it
 
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Paul I'm Paul Halverson
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
h-a-l-v-o-r-s-e-n and I'm the Merrimack
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
County attorney
 
00:35:20.569 --> 00:35:20.579 align:start position:0%
um attorney strelsen and director
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
Staples took many of my comments so I'll
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
just adopt what they had to say uh into
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
my testimony please and uh only uh
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
expand on what I wanted to say from some
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
questions that you had one of the
 
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
questions talked about not and attorney
 
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
straussen mentioned this about whether
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
or not this statute if it was an act it
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
would be over broad I think the answer
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
clearly is yes you asked that that
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
question and I sat down when this when I
 
00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
first read this and did a short list of
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
um of items that would be affected by
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
the statute and the list was quite quite
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
long it included the automatic
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
fingerprint identification system that's
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
used at police departments it affected
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
any phone dump that would generate
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
evidence in sexual assaults seeking the
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
software for individual phones internet
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
crimes against children which I know
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
someone's going to speak about here in a
 
00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
few minutes it would affect that the
 
00:36:25.569 --> 00:36:25.579 align:start position:0%
intoxic 9000 a tried and true item
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
that's even certified by the federal
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
government used for years it would
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
affect the software regarding that any
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
digital analysis of firearm shell
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
casings bullets and tool tool marks even
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
a digital stopwatch that I bet the guy
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
in the plane uses to time people on on
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
89 for uh for speeding tickets the
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
software of that stopwatch with this
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
legislation could be re could be
 
00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
requested the most innocuous objects
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
that we use on a daily day-to-day basis
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
would be called into question for the
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
reliability I'm sure many any of us look
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
at our digital watches for those of you
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
who have digital watches I'm an analog
 
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:05.579 align:start position:0%
guy myself but you look at your digital
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
watch and works all the time pretty much
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
and when you look at it that pretty
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
keeps pretty accurate time it's pretty
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
accepted item but under this statute the
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
use of that watch if an officer uses it
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
in a DWI stop the time part of his field
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
sobriety testings the software on that
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
watch could could be requested that
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
watch was used to generate evidence
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
against a defendant so is it over broad
 
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
you bet do I think that this legislation
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
is needed I do not attorney straussen
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned he used the word gatekeeper
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
and he also mentioned the gatekeeper in
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
that New Jersey versus Pickett case
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
being the individual judge he like I
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
pulled out our cell phones when Mr
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
Gallagher mentioned New Jersey versus
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
Pickett and look that case up in that
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
case did indeed involve a novel involved
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
what they at the time when was a novel
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
approach to an analysis and I didn't go
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
as much in depth as attorney Charleson
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
did but the gatekeeper in that case was
 
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
the judge attorney straussen mentioned
 
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
that we have a robust system here in New
 
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:14.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that works very very well
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
probably close to 15 years ago now I
 
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
litigated a case where the Mr Nelson I
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
don't mean to interrupt you but I'm just
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know I guess I would ask if you
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
could move along I was going to ask
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
others this is my last example all right
 
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I litigated a case with a
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
source code for the intoxicizer 5000 was
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
requested and just as attorneys
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
Charleston said there were appropriate
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
protective orders took place uh issued
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
the gatekeeper who was the judge acted
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
on that issue and ensured that the
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
individual rights of the defendant were
 
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
protected and the individual uh
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
secrets of the trade the trade secrets
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the company were also protected at
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
the same time so other than that I'll
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
defer to uh any of your questions and uh
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions from the
 
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.829 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions from the
committee

00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much and I'm
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to next call uh Stephen uh n
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
Anders I think I've promised that
 
00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.109 align:start position:0%
Anders I think I've promised that
correctly

00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
um and again Mr Anders I I want welcome
 
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
and we want to hear your testimony I
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
would just ask if if somebody's already
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
said something and you know we've we've
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
probably got it so I'd ask you if you
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
could try not to repeat things that
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
other people have said absolutely thank
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
you the only thing I would add is that I
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
don't believe the court can order a
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
third party to reveal their source code
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
so it essentially would fall on the
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
state to request the third party to
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
reveal their source code
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
um certainly technology companies and
 
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
companies writing source code may have
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
no interest in revealing that
 
00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.069 align:start position:0%
no interest in revealing that
information

00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
which would essentially put the
 
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
admissibility of evidence into the hands
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
of these third parties
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing I wanted to add if
 
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:56.839 align:start position:0%
there are any questions
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
for this witness can we just get from
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
behalf of the NHA CDL we did not request
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
this bill or consult with a sponsor but
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
we are in here in support of this bill
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
I've been a criminal defense lawyer in

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
Gill
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
shows the basic principle that we were
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
all taught in third grade mathematics
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
which is show your work and while you
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
can come up with extreme examples of
 
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
things that are mundane that would
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
require divulging under the source code
 
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
I think that we have to realize that all
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
of this is filtered through how a
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
criminal case works and some of the
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised I think go to
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
that direct issue so representative
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
Alexander originally spoke about
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
concerns for protect security we get
 
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
information all the time in a criminal
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
case it's subject to protective order so
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
that issue is something the courts
 
00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:53.339 align:start position:0%
routinely deal with and it wouldn't be a
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
problem representative Alexander also
 
00:41:57.849 --> 00:41:57.859 align:start position:0%
talked about an independent evaluator
 
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the way that the criminal
 
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
system works now most of the cases get
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
the state gets information from the
 
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
state lab and then the defense gets that
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
information and they go out and they
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
hire an expert to evaluate it so it's
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
not really an independent evaluator
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
because they're hired by the defense but
 
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
they are somebody that's separate from
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
the defense apparatus that will look at
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
it and I can tell you that most good
 
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers go and find their expert
 
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
with one guiding principle tell me what
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
the science says don't tell me what you
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
think I want to hear tell me what the
 
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
science says and so to the extent that
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's how the system works it is sort
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
of getting to your idea about the
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
independent evaluator you also mentioned
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuits one thing that you
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
should all be aware of and I think most
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
of you are is that prosecutors have
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
basically absolute immunity under the
 
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
doctrine of prosecutorial immunity and
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
police and other state workers have
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
immunity under the qualified immunity
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
Doctrine which is difficult to pierce
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
and I can't think of a scenario in which
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
failing to develop source code would
 
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
constitute grounds for a lawsuit because
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
you'd also have to prove damages and
 
00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
damages would mean that the person would
 
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
be innocent but for the source code
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
divulging and it's it's very complicated
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
to Envision a scenario where that would
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
happen the other thing that I want to
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
bring to the committee's attention is
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
that as the criminal justice system
 
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
develops and responds the increases in
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
technology we have cases that are
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
essentially given to these black boxes
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
and the black boxes tell us guilty or
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
innocent now there are other things that
 
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
you can do to challenge the
 
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
admissibility of the evidence but in
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
cases like possession of child
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
pornography in cases where DNA is
 
00:43:40.329 --> 00:43:40.339 align:start position:0%
important in cases where you have to do
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
evaluations of skid mark analysis and
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
car accidents you know and the DWI cases
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned before in drug identification
 
00:43:48.599 --> 00:43:49.809 align:start position:0%
mentioned before in drug identification
cases

00:43:49.809 --> 00:43:49.819 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:53.099 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the case comes down to what
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
does the machine tell us
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
and if we don't know how the machine
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
tells us that how can we be sure that is
 
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
reliable and the example I want to give
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
is a pretty simple one a long time ago
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
in the 1960s they developed something
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
called the modified Duke noise test and
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
it was a way of detecting drugs you put
 
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
a little bit of the drugs in a tube the
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
tube had a reagent in it the reagent
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
interacted with the drugs and It
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
produced the color then you match the
 
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
color on a chart and it told you what
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
the drugs were well later many many
 
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
years later as scientists were
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
evaluating the validity of some of these
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
modified duquinoise tests that were
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
designed for use on the street they
 
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
found that marijuana was a cross
 
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
indicator with two things that are
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
relatively common coffee grounds and
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
essence of sandalwood and these are
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
things that I mentioned as an example of
 
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
why we need to be able to have access to
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
these basic fundamental parts of these
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
black box machines that determine guilt
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
or innocence if we can't be sure that
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
they're working right then we can't be
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
sure that the conviction is right and I
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
think the fact that we have a system
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
where we get to ask these questions is
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
really important but having this statute
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
would make sure that the courts are
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
aware that this is something we need to
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
take notice of your honor uh Mr chair
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
the couple of things that you had asked
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh the New Jersey case I think Attorney
 
00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
Charles had mentioned the big issue was
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
because it was a novel issue and a novel
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
way of testing they had not fully gone
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
through the Delbert analysis and so that
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
is why the court authorized the release
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
of the source code you would also ask
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
why do we need a statute and I think
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
that the reason why we need a statute is
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
largely because we need to have people
 
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
take notice and be cognizant of the role
 
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
these technological black boxes play in
 
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
determinations of guilt or innocence
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
some defense lawyers know some
 
00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
prosecutors know some judges know that
 
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
these things are real but there are also
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
places where you know in the hubbub and
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
hustle of a court room which you
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
remember very well it may not be on the
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
front of somebody's mind to say hey what
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
what is the mechanism that this thin
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
layer chromatography machine at the
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
state lab uses to determine the Peaks
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
that show this is a chemical of one sort
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
or another and if we have a statute not
 
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
only does it give the defendant the
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
ability to Avail themselves of that
 
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
right it also puts it in people's mind
 
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
this is something we should be looking
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
at attorney straussen who have a great
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
deal of respect for it I should tell you
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
I've known all the prosecutors here that
 
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
have testified I have a great deal of
 
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
respect for all of them and many of
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
their points are correct one thing that
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
he mentioned that I want to point out is
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
that it allows a challenge in every case
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's not what the language of the bill
 
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
says the language of the bill simply
 
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
says the defendant shall have a right to
 
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.050 align:start position:0%
says the defendant shall have a right to
examine

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:44.060 align:start position:0%
examine
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
bringing that challenge later on is
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
something that would be made between the
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
lawyer and the client and I think that
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
the division of labor and the
 
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
ineffective assistance of council area
 
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
shows that it is the lawyer that would
 
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
ultimately decide to make the challenge
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
so it is not the case that by passing
 
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
this bill a challenge would arise in
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
every case where there is a bit of
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
technology used at least that's not the
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
language that's used here
 
00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.950 align:start position:0%
language that's used here
um

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
there were a couple other points uh
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh I believe it was representative Manos
 
00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:17.099 align:start position:0%
you were looking for the citation for
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
State versus Pickett it is uh 466 New
 
00:47:24.849 --> 00:47:24.859 align:start position:0%
Jersey super 270 it's a 2021 case
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
um I think that one of the
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
representatives I think it was
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Turner brought up the
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
issue of ineffective assistance of
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
counsel and I think that this is
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
probably the most cogent problem with
 
00:47:40.849 --> 00:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
the bill but I do think that there is a
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
workaround that is Incorporated in how
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
these cases are processed that makes it
 
00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
a non-issue so if you have a defendant
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
who is particularly obstreperous and
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
decides that he wants to challenge the
 
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
source code on you know the digital
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
watch for the guy that pulled him over
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
for speeding he's going to do that no
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
matter what it's going to happen whether
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
his lawyer tells him no or not it's
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
going to happen no matter what and so
 
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
the idea that this would cause a bunch
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
of new challenges is probably not the
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
case because most of the time they're
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
filtered through the lawyer and in the
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
cases where the defendant and it's so
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
obstreperous that he doesn't listen to
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
his lawyer he's going to slow down the
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
process no matter what we do whether
 
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
this bill exists or not but in terms of
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
ineffective assistance of counsel the
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
standard to prove an effective
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
assistance of counsel is so high that
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
the scenarios in which non a non-request
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
of the source code constitutes an
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
effective assistance of counsel are
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
vanishingly small if not impossible for
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
me to conceive of is it theoretically
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
possible in a million years that
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
somebody could figure out a scenario yes
 
00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
is it likely given how high the standard
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
is in an effective assistance of
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
councils this cases the answer I think
 
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
is unequivocally no and so I think that
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
the committee should support this bill
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
this bill just goes to the fundamental
 
00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
basic fairness of show your work it is
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
not unduly burdensome and because of the
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
protective order I think that we would
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
be able to meet the concern the private
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
companies would have about divulging
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
source code that they worked on for
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
years to produce if anybody has any
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
questions on questions uh yes
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bruce
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you Mr chair for the
 
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
for the uh for coming and for taking
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
their questions is this bill
 
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
establishing a new right or does a
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
defendant already have a right and this
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
bill is just declaring that they do in
 
00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
fact have this right that's it's not
 
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
inside baseball kind of thing
 
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
so I will tell you as a defense lawyer I
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
would love the answer to be this is just
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
codifying a right the defendants already
 
00:49:50.329 --> 00:49:50.339 align:start position:0%
have but I think that the problem is and
 
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
why this bill would be important is the
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
area of source code knowledge is such an
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
esoteric fine point that even if they
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
have this right I'm not sure how many
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
people Avail themselves of it in the
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
same way that we've had a right to
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
privacy before The Constitution in New
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was amended based on both
 
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
state and federal law putting that into
 
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
language and putting that into writing
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
helps people understand what their
 
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
rights are so I think that we already
 
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
have this right the problem is I'm not
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
sure how many judges would agree with me
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr scombre
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you manager Mr chair
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Lynn members of
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Wade brown
 
00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.339 align:start position:0%
brown spelled like the color I'm a
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
detective at Concord PD I'm here as a
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire icac which
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
is internet crimes against children task
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
force our commander is out on a active
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
case this morning so I'm here in his
 
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
place we obviously oppose this bill for
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
reasons that have been mentioned the
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
only thing I'll add is when we are
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
investigating child sexual abuse
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
material or csam as we call it that
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
typically comes from one of these tech
 
00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:09.260 align:start position:0%
companies such as Google Facebook
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
Microsoft discovering these images or
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
these videos on their servers and then
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
turning them over to neck Mac the
 
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
national Center for missing and
 
00:51:20.569 --> 00:51:20.579 align:start position:0%
exploited children ultimately they track
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
an IP address and determine that the
 
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
crime occurred in New Hampshire and it
 
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
gets assigned out that way my point is
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
is that these are tech companies that
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
are used by the general public so it has
 
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with what the government
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
uses as far as forensic software or
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
other operating systems this this is
 
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
what the public uses to make these
 
00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
transactions and this legislation would
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
clearly open up that source code for
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
these as it generates evidence so we'll
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
clearly open that up to any defendant
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
charged with a crime that involves one
 
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
of those tech companies we cannot
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
force them to use open source they're
 
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
going to use Facebook they're going to
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
use Google and to expect any of those
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
companies to turn over source code to
 
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
assist us is not realistic and would
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
create a loophole that anyone any good
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
defense attorney would seek to exploit
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
oh that's all I have if there's any
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions for this
 
00:52:15.839 --> 00:52:17.569 align:start position:0%

representative Jess Edwards of
 
00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:29.579 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31 that's Auburn
 
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
Candia Chester and Deerfield I'm here
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
today to
 
00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:40.220 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 68 FN to you
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative Mark McLean is also a
 
00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:45.059 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill he introduced a
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
similar Bill last year that that did not
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
succeed uh I the reason I'm I got
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
involved is because my next door
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
neighbor in Auburn
 
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
caught me while I was out pretending to
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
mow the lawn and do weeds and uh and
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
start talking me up about this she's an
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
older woman who's lost her husband a few
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
years ago and has grandkids and stuff in
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
the area so she got to be very concerned
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
about and got to be very familiar with
 
00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
what it takes to as a single person to
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
transfer property upon death and so this
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill took model legislation OLS took the
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
model legislation and then tailored it
 
00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire the problem it's a 10
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
thing to solve is that for anyone
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
going through the process of setting up
 
00:54:46.329 --> 00:54:46.339 align:start position:0%
your estate
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
can be take take a lot of time can be
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
very complex can be very costly and even
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
for people who should be able to do it
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
fairly easily because they have sort of
 
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.030 align:start position:0%
fairly easily because they have sort of
the

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
background to be able to read the legal
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
documents and understand it it can be
 
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
difficult when my wife died I needed to
 
00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:10.700 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
to make sure that my kids could get the
 
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
property and and so I consider just
 
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
doing it in a will that created a
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
probate potential probate situation I
 
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.549 align:start position:0%
probate potential probate situation I
considered

00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
doing it in a trust and that's what I
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
ended up doing I started with one
 
00:55:31.319 --> 00:55:32.109 align:start position:0%
ended up doing I started with one
attorney

00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
and I I just had so much avoidance
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
because the document was about 50 pages
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
thick to do a trust
 
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
and it costs thirty five hundred dollars
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
so I just couldn't like you know
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
approach it and I can't imagine I'd be
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
the only one like that well you know
 
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
finally I did uh get it done I have a
 
00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:56.339 align:start position:0%
trust it's about 50 pages thick it cost
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
me about thirty five hundred dollars
 
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
um and uh and so that's taken care of
 
00:56:05.089 --> 00:56:05.099 align:start position:0%
now the limitations of that trust
 
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
um are still that it doesn't do a lot of
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
things that a normal person needs done
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
it transfers my real property but all of
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
my financial accounts which is really
 
00:56:20.049 --> 00:56:20.059 align:start position:0%
the my estate the property and the money
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
each of those has to be done
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
independently with the financial
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
institution and some sort of an
 
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
arrangement with them declaring your
 
00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries so so even though a trust
 
00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
can be expensive it's still relatively
 
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:39.260 align:start position:0%
incomplete what this proposes is instead
 
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
filing a single little sheet front and
 
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
back the front is the form the back or
 
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
the typical questions and answers so
 
00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
this is intended for those people who
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
you know probably the most common
 
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
scenario is they were married they had
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
their property in joint tenancy the
 
00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
partner dies they need to worry about as
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
a single person what are they going to
 
00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
do with that property this this would be
 
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
a simple way of doing it
 
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:10.910 align:start position:0%
a simple way of doing it
um

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
okay so as I was flipping through this I
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
noticed in the fiscal note that there
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be a concern on the County's
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
part about whether or not there this
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
could have a financial impact the
 
00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
financial impact if there is one is not
 
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:32.180 align:start position:0%
stated I I know that uh uh the
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
outstanding uh Register of Deeds from
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County is here to testify and
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
talking to her briefly several months
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
ago she was not a immediately amenable
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
to this and so I I have to be in my
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
hearing at 10. I'd love to stay and
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
stick around but I would say whatever
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
she says if we need to like add some
 
00:57:58.569 --> 00:57:58.579 align:start position:0%
sort of attacks on a transfer on death
 
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
deed to keep the counties whole I I I'd
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
be fine with that because I know
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
compared to thirty five hundred dollars
 
00:58:09.849 --> 00:58:09.859 align:start position:0%
to pay an attorney for a trust
 
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
paying the county a smaller a much
 
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
smaller amount in order to process a
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
transfer on death form is still in the
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
best interests of of our citizens so so
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I'd be open to questions if there are
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
any questions remember yes uh
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
Edwards my only drawback on this and I'm
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
you can see I'm older and
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
my husband and I are trying to get
 
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
things together
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
is the people that might be exploited
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.609 --> 00:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
I you know I don't have an answer to
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
your question the exploitation is just
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
deeply embedded in our society and and
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
there's you know a caveat and tour
 
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
everywhere uh I I would I would hope
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
that uh if this uh committee supports
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
this bill you can either figure some
 
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:18.299 align:start position:0%
little codicil in there in an amendment
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
or jail car could figure something out
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
or that you know once it got to the
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
registrared Deeds people like you know
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
um Miss Stacy would have a great idea I
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
think that's a valid concern but uh keep
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
in mind that the point of this is to
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
make it much less expensive much simpler
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
and save a lot of time for each of our
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
citizens and with that benefit that with
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
that reward yes I can see some
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
incremental risk
 
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Perez
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
um I just have a question about this
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
would this eliminate having to go
 
01:00:05.289 --> 01:00:05.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:08.339 align:start position:0%
that's the goal I mean this would this
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
is this is a dumb thing to do if it
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh bypass uh the probate
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
requirement uh and would it
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
if if you had an irrevocable trust
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
would this supersede an irrevocable
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
trustee in my case I could have done
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
this instead of an irrevocable trust I
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
went ahead and did an irrevocable trust
 
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
it cost me thirty five hundred dollars
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
it don't it only did uh my my my real
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
property my house basically uh it did
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
not do my financial accounts I had to do
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
those independently so this is meant to
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
be an alternative to a irrevocable trust
 
01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
there would still be those people who
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
would benefit from having an irrevocable
 
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
trust instead of a simple transfer on
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
death this would just create an option
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
for those people who have a simpler
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
estate planning requirement but it could
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
be done in addition to that probably as
 
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
well to verify perhaps trust I I don't
 
01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
know I I think that might actually raise
 
01:01:12.299 --> 01:01:13.549 align:start position:0%
know I I think that might actually raise
um

01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
another issue with which document if
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
they are in conflict in any way which
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
one would be Supreme to the other I I I
 
01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:24.059 align:start position:0%
don't know that's a question I didn't
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
anticipate thank you representative
 
01:01:26.339 --> 01:01:27.109 align:start position:0%
anticipate thank you representative
Smith

01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair first in
 
01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:32.299 align:start position:0%
out of respect for my colleague
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I hope no one
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
takes seriously his suggestion that um
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
we manage it with attacks I don't think
 
01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:45.740 align:start position:0%
he liked that quote in any place else
 
01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:50.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:54.310 align:start position:0%
for the record taxation is theft
 
01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:58.780 align:start position:0%
for the record taxation is theft
[Laughter]

01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:03.109 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:05.579 align:start position:0%
um but representative Edwards if I
 
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
recall correctly one of the questions
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
that arose last year when this was
 
01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:12.140 align:start position:0%
before this committee
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
um it might very well be that the
 
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
recipient of your largesse might not be
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
interested for example it might be a
 
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.309 align:start position:0%
interested for example it might be a
property

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
um where there is
 
01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
um involved some
 
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.890 align:start position:0%
um involved some
um

01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.710 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.890 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenz is trying to help
 
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
me I said in conferences thank you it's
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
a good catch our word summon coverages
 
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
for example if it is property physical
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
property that had been condemned in some
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
way and would require extensive
 
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
expenditures in order to get it up to a
 
01:02:57.490 --> 01:02:57.500 align:start position:0%
legal standard
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
or if it had in fact there was a lot of
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
debt involved in that and to have
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
um property
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
given to you without you having agreed
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
to accept it might create
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
some problem did you think of that as a
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
wrinkle okay so I think it wrinkles a
 
01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
lot these days uh for what it's worth
 
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
but uh I I would say there are two
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
different ways that to respond to that
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
one one is I'm not an attorney I don't
 
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
deal in a state law but I suspect uh
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
what the problem you're raising is not
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
so dissimilar to somebody leaving you
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
property and a will it's still got to be
 
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
worked out on whether or not you want to
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
accept the property and and two the if
 
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:53.339 align:start position:0%
there's not an ability in this model
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
legislation to refuse the grant of the
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
property then I I think that would be
 
01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
something that could be addressed
 
01:04:06.049 --> 01:04:06.059 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you other questions yes
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
representative Turner
 
01:04:10.609 --> 01:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick question are you aware
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
of anywhere else that this is a process
 
01:04:14.569 --> 01:04:14.579 align:start position:0%
like this has been adopted and
 
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
implemented and what the experience has
 
01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:19.140 align:start position:0%
been if so that that is an excellent
 
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
question and and I'm gonna have to tell
 
01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
you I don't I can't cite you today where
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
this has been adopted I I will say that
 
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
it has been adopted in other states I
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
think the number is about six or seven
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
and it is model legislation so it's
 
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:39.059 align:start position:0%
floating around and available to any
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
state to you know try it out for size
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
so I can
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
try to get you an answer to that
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
question and I'm sorry I can't see your
 
01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
name from here it's Eric turr t-u-r-e-r
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll I'll give it probably to
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh your Clerk or your Vice chair sure no
 
01:04:59.809 --> 01:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine okay that's fine
 
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
other other questions for yes uh
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:06.599 --> 01:05:07.490 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
depending why
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
in the situation of your neighbor she
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't just retitle the property on
 
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
her husband's death why she couldn't
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
just retitle the property in the name of
 
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
the children her and the children or
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
whoever else she wanted to have on the
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
deed why why do we need this statute I
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
mean clear so that that's that's a
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
really good question I I in my
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
experiences I went through this going
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
talking to the attorney that helped me
 
01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:42.059 align:start position:0%
with my irrevocable trust
 
01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
um the uh down potential downsides of
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
doing that transfer of the deed
 
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:50.180 align:start position:0%
prior to your own death
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
are involved in sort of the potential
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
you know corrupting influences of the
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
property and whether or not you would be
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to continue to live in your own
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
property and and and that and that sort
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
of thing and so that so I don't know if
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
that was the marketing to get me to go
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
ahead and buy a irrevocable trust
 
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
package versus going to see Miss Stacy
 
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
to you know figure it out uh in another
 
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:17.510 align:start position:0%
to you know figure it out uh in another
way

01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
so that's a good I hopefully she'll
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
address that in her testimony
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
other uh yes representative divine
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
um my question refers to there's there's
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
a a line on page six
 
01:06:33.299 --> 01:06:33.950 align:start position:0%
a a line on page six
um

01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
it down the number eight
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
where it says you may not revoke the
 
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
transfer on death Deed by Will
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
so is that to say if you did this and
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
then you changed your mind and you set
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
up a will after the fact
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't hold up in court
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
an excellent question for an attorney
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
that does estate law I I do not and so I
 
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
don't want to venture other than to say
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
this is this is model legislation that
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
OLS uh tailored to read New Hampshire if
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
that's an issue and and let's say it is
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
it it probably does need to be addressed
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
in some way you know I represented I I
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
don't think it is and I think that there
 
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
are there are if you in the statute
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are ways in which you can revoke
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
the the you know that if you make the
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
transfer you you you prepare the deed to
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
make the transfer on death but then you
 
01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
change your mind there are ways that you
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
can you can reverse that this just says
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
that one of the ways is not by a will
 
01:07:46.089 --> 01:07:46.099 align:start position:0%
you have to do it while you're still
 
01:07:48.289 --> 01:07:48.299 align:start position:0%
something that becomes effective before
 
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
you die and and that's also in this
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
document the way in which you can uh
 
01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
revoke uh this transfer on death it's in
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's in there any other questions uh for
 
01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
representative representative I know
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're you've got to go and I I don't
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
want to hold you up one but I just have
 
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
one question and I wonder if you've
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
thought about if if you know the answer
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
to this one of the things I saw on page
 
01:08:18.169 --> 01:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
uh the first page is it it says in in uh
 
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
on line 30 that transfers on a transfer
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
on Def deed is non-testamentary and I
 
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
guess my only question is do you know
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
what what the tax implications of this
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
would be under Federal in other words
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
generally under federal law if you
 
01:08:39.769 --> 01:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
something that you leave by inheritance
 
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
the person who gets it gets what's
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
called a stepped up basis they get their
 
01:08:46.249 --> 01:08:46.259 align:start position:0%
basis in the property is the value of
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
the property on the date of death
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
I think that's based on the fact that it
 
01:08:52.849 --> 01:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
is a testamentary transfer and so I'm
 
01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:53.870 align:start position:0%
is a testamentary transfer and so I'm
wondering

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
if if this would have a tax disadvantage
 
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
if somebody utilized this and I don't
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
know whether you know the answer or not
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the answer I'm just
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
really asking
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
if I I I'm just learning how to spell
 
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
the word uh so I I'm not prepared to
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
provide a a legal response of tax
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
implications so all right well if I know
 
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I think it's something we need
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
to think about but other questions for
 
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.420 align:start position:0%

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
bar here in New Hampshire and I've been
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
practicing about 30 years
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
um I can answer some of the questions
 
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
that have been raised so I welcome those
 
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
questions after I'm done with my
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
testimony but just by way of background
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
I want to let you know that last year
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
when Senate Bill 43 was introduced which
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
was the initial version of a transfer on
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
death deed statute I testified against
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
that statute and that is not because I'm
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
at all philosophically opposed to
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
transfer on death Deeds I actually think
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
that they are a good idea and they would
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
be a welcome addition to my toolkit as
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
an estate planner and I totally agree
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
with the testimony of Representative
 
01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
Edwards on the issue of having this
 
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed available to
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
folks who otherwise do not have a
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
complicated estate plan do not need the
 
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
services of a trust in a state's lawyer
 
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
to help them pass their property at
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
death so I think transfer on death Deeds
 
01:10:59.330 --> 01:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
are something that we ought to have here
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I know one of the
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
representatives asked how many states
 
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
have enacted similar legislation the
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
answer is approximately 29 and so
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
certainly there is a track record for
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
this sort of legislation in other
 
01:11:16.199 --> 01:11:17.689 align:start position:0%
this sort of legislation in other
jurisdictions

01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted the members of this
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee to know that last year when
 
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
the initial transfer on death deed bill
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
was proposed a number of trusts and
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
States practitioners here in New
 
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire myself included got together
 
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
and took a look at that legislation we
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
had a number of questions and issues
 
01:11:38.209 --> 01:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
with that legislation so over the past
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
eight months we as a group have been
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
working on improvements to last year's
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
Bill and so we were taken a little bit
 
01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
by surprise to find that a new Bill had
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
been proposed in this session uh the
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
bill that we're discussing today and I
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
have to say that the new bill that's
 
01:11:58.850 --> 01:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
been proposed is a huge improvement over
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
what was proposed last year and so what
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
we myself and members of our drafting
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
tne legislative committee would like to
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
do is to have an opportunity to speak to
 
01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:13.460 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
hb68 to sort of work with them to
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
improve this piece of legislation so I
 
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
just want to highlight a couple of
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
issues that I see as a tne practitioner
 
01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:27.860 align:start position:0%
with the bill that's on the table today
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
with a view towards improving it so that
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
we do end up with a very good transfer
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
on death deed statute here in New
 
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so just by way of example
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
um disclaimer representative Smith you
 
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
are concerned about what to do in a
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
situation where a parent
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
transfers on death via one of these
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
transform identities a piece of property
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
to a child and that child doesn't want
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
it and that may be because the child has
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
tax problems it may be because the
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
property is contaminated and has you
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
know underground storage tanks there are
 
01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
a number of reasons why people who are
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
gifted property don't want to accept it
 
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses that issue there is
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
a provision in
 
01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:12.260 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
2068 that says that you can disclaim
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
your interest you don't have to accept
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
what people leave you via transfer on
 
01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
death deed
 
01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
but the only problem with the
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
legislation as it's currently structured
 
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
is that there's no notification
 
01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
requirement and so as someone who's been
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
in the trenches working on these issues
 
01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:32.420 align:start position:0%
for 30 years what I can tell you is
 
01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
oftentimes parents want to leave assets
 
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
to children and especially if it's an
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
asset like a piece of property
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
those children may not be notified for
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
some period of time that they're
 
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
actually the recipients of this piece of
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
property and both under New Hampshire
 
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
law and under federal law you have a
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
nine month deadline to disclaim and if
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're the lucky recipient of Grandma's
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
contaminated property and no one tells
 
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
you that and there's no notification
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
requirement in the bill
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
then you're stuck with it because you're
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
going to miss your nine month disclaimer
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
deadline so at the very least the bill
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's currently on the table should be
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
modified to include some sort of
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
notification requirement so that people
 
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
who are recipients of property via
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed are notified that
 
01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
they've been given the property and then
 
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
have a proper opportunity to walk away
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
if this turns out to be something they
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
don't want so that's an improvement that
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
could be made to the statute and there
 
01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:37.460 align:start position:0%
really should be made to this statute
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
one of the other issues I have with this
 
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
bill posed and it's not surprising
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
because this comes from the uniform act
 
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
and is anyone you know who practices law
 
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
will tell you there's nothing uniform
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
about how New Hampshire Works versus
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
Maine versus California or some of these
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions so every one of
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
these uniform acts when proposed does
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
have to be tinkered with so that it
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't sort of work in opposition to
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
some of the state's existing laws so in
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
particular the issue here one of the
 
01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
issues I have with this bill and again
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's a solution is the Creditor claim
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
period so if I own a piece of property
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
and I just want to pass the property to
 
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
my kids and I don't want to bother doing
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
will so I want to do this simple process
 
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
of transfer on death deed I can do that
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
and I should have the ability to do that
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
however everyone dies with creditors I
 
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
have yet to meet a single client who
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
died owing nothing there's always the
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
last credit card bill there is always
 
01:15:41.689 --> 01:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
the bill from the oil delivery that just
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
got made two days before your death
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
there are medical bills there are always
 
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
everyone dies with unpaid bills
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
if you've managed to transfer your
 
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
property on death instantly to your
 
01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:55.970 align:start position:0%
property on death instantly to your
children

01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
what are your creditors going to do if
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
they need to be paid all your assets are
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
gone you named your kids in your bank
 
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
accounts everything walks out the door
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
and the poor creditors are left holding
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
the bag
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in this bill that
 
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
deals with creditor claims however
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
it doesn't comport with our current
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
probate laws
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
so one of the other issues that we need
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
to address and again there's the
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
solution to this problem is to make sure
 
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
that unpaid bills have a way to be paid
 
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
if real estate is the last or only asset
 
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
and it's already walked out the door and
 
01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
the problem with this legislation as
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
proposed is that it doesn't mesh with
 
01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
our current probate statutes and with
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
the time limits that we currently have
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law for filing
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
claims against the estate of a dissent
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
so the current deadline in New Hampshire
 
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
is a six-month claim period and a
 
01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
12-month claim period but all claims
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
have to be presented in the probate
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
process in 12 months what the current
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation what hb68 says is
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
you have 18 months
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
well if the last of this statute says
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
you've got 18 months to present your
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
claims but the probate statute says you
 
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
only have 6 or 12. I think that's a
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be fixed so again
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
there's a solution to the problem and it
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we have to throw this
 
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
legislation out but there are aspects of
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
this that just don't comport with New
 
01:17:23.649 --> 01:17:23.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I just want to
 
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
point out and this is something that's
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
not addressed in our statute and I don't
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
know how to deal with it
 
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
is the issue of title companies
 
01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:36.410 align:start position:0%
is the issue of title companies
so

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
if I want to leave my property to my
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
kids via one of these transfer of death
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
deeds and I die and my kids inherit the
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
property that's all well and good
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
that transfer does not come with any
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
warranty covenants that's what this bill
 
01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
provides and I think that's the right
 
01:17:52.739 --> 01:17:53.810 align:start position:0%
provides and I think that's the right
answer

01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
however if my kids have inherited this
 
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
property and want to turn around and
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
sell it the next day and the person
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
they're selling it to needs Bank
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
financing there isn't a title company
 
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
that will ensure title
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
and that's because
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
the transfer on transfer on death deed
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't come with any warranty covenants
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
so that's an issue that has to be worked
 
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
out and I just want this committee to be
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
aware that when Maine passed its
 
01:18:23.209 --> 01:18:23.219 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed statute a couple
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
of years ago they did not address this
 
01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
issue and it caused an enormous amount
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
of strain on local title companies there
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
are title companies now that no longer
 
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
write title or underwrite at all in the
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
state of Maine because of Maine's
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
transfer on death D statute so before we
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
finalize the statute I think we need
 
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
buy-in from the title insurance
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
companies to make sure that we're not
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
creating Title Insurance problems with
 
01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you Mr
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chairman this is a question
 
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
for you the witness began by saying that
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
she would want to go back to the
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
sponsors to see about uh changes but as
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
you well know
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
um this bill is now in our hands it is
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
no longer in the hands of the sponsors
 
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
and so it's up to us to do something is
 
01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:21.380 align:start position:0%
this a bill where it might make sense
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh for you to create a subcommittee to
 
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
look at uh the language and uh potential
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
by seeking
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm someone subjecting to what I'm
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
saying oh dear
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and obviously by seeking
 
01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
involvement from uh those people who are
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
involved professionally in this area to
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
see if we can address some of the
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
questions and come up with Solutions
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
before the full committee discusses and
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
votes on the bill uh sure what you know
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
I'm completely open to that what I what
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
I was wondering though would it make
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
would it would it make sense and perhaps
 
01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.219 align:start position:0%
shorten the process if we asked I mean
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
can I just ask you how how close are you
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
to having
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
you know sort of a final version that
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
would fix the problems you've identified
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're probably within 30 days uh we have
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
a meeting this Friday and a meeting on
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
Friday the 27th of our drafting
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
committee we've been working on this for
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
eight months so I think we're quite
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
close so I I you know I what I what I'd
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
love to do maybe is we could if what
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
rather than hold up the witness if we
 
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
could talk about I'm perfectly open to
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
to either you know doing a subcommittee
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
or maybe just saying we won't exec this
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
bill until we've all until we all have
 
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
the until we have the the uh the version
 
01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
that you've you've talked about because
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
I it seemed to me anyway that you've
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
you've identified very real problems
 
01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
that we ought to that we want you know
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
we want to address we have and I think
 
01:21:05.689 --> 01:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
there is a solution and our committee as
 
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
a whole feels as if this is a good idea
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of New Hampshire but we
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to pass a bill that
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
inadvertently creates problems for our
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
title insurance companies our bankers
 
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
and for the recipients of these
 
01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.370 align:start position:0%
and for the recipients of these
properties

01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you a question we have a number of
 
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
questions representative tur
 
01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
re oh yeah thanks
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
um uh represent Edwards uh pointed out
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
that he's not a Texan uh attorney
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if you had any uh
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts on
 
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
um chairman Lin's question regarding
 
01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:41.219 align:start position:0%
changing the basis uh I do okay I
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
actually have the answer to that
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
question I'm glad I have the benefit of
 
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
of being a tax attorney as well as an
 
01:21:47.930 --> 01:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
estate planner so I feel fairly
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
confident in the answer so the answer to
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
your question representative Lynn is yes
 
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
the property would receive a step up in
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
basis at death and that's because by
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
Nature by by the virtue of the fact that
 
01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
the transfer doesn't occur until the
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
death it means that the owner of the
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
property remains in control of the
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
property until that death and that's
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
enough to qualify for basis step up so
 
01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes right other questions
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative divine
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
um my question has to do with fraud in
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
getting into you know the deeds and has
 
01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
there been a problem in New Hampshire
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
for fraud and is that growing with
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
the Deeds being transferred or prior to
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
transfer that's a great question and I
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to step on uh attorney
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
panabianco's toes because he was going
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
to address this issue but an answer to
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
your question is we don't have a
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed statute so I I we
 
01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
obviously don't have a problem with this
 
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
particular issue but we do absolutely
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
have a problem in New Hampshire with
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
fraud and duress and undue influence
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
with respect to wills and trusts
 
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
demographically we are an older State I
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
see people trying to take advantage of
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
my elderly clients and I don't like it
 
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.430 align:start position:0%
my elderly clients and I don't like it
so

01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
there are ways to address that issue in
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
this bill and attorney Upon A Bianca
 
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that because we as a
 
01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
legislative drafting committee have
 
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
addressed that issue in some of the new
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
language that we propose adding to this
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
bill so yes it's a real issue and it has
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with and we need to protect
 
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
our older citizens from fraud thank you
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative representative Alexander
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair there's some more
 
01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
question just to um pivot off of
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
Representative Smith but is this an
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
early bill or can we choose to
 
01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
um no this is not this is not early bill
 
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
so the committee has the ability to hold
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
off and wait until the experts kind of
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
get right okay perfect thank you
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it's been very
 
01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you
 
01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh next
 
01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:01.550 align:start position:0%
uh next
um

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh committee uh as
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
anything my name is Michael panabianco
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
I'm a trust in the state's tax attorney
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
I live and work in Concord New Hampshire
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
and for many years I was an Adjunct
 
01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
professor at uh Franklin Pierce law
 
01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
school where I taught Wills trusts and
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
Estates I'm here on my own behalf as
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
attorney salik indicated there's a
 
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
committee of attorneys that have been
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
working the past eight months on
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
improving this bill I'm one of the
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys on that committee I agree with
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
everything that attorney salic has
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
already testified on and I'm not going
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
to repeat that here but I want to say
 
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
that I am in agreement with what she
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
already said a couple of things that I
 
01:24:53.689 --> 01:24:53.699 align:start position:0%
wanted to add and one of which she
 
01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
alluded to was the idea of how do we
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
deal with fraud and and challenges to it
 
01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:01.940 align:start position:0%
so the current statute does not address
 
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
challenges to whether or not the
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed is valid one of
 
01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
the provisions that we've added into
 
01:25:12.169 --> 01:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
this bill somebody has the ability to
 
01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:14.219 align:start position:0%
challenge the validity of the transfer
 
01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
on death D just like somebody could
 
01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:17.699 align:start position:0%
challenge the validity of a will after
 
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:20.300 align:start position:0%
the person has died so there are some
 
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
mechanisms by which we're putting into
 
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
what we're working on to address and
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
counter potential fraud for transfer on
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
death Deeds
 
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
one of the other one of the other things
 
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
that the bill does not address that
 
01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
we're addressing and what we've been
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
drafting is whether or not and to what
 
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
extent an agent under a power of
 
01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:43.450 align:start position:0%
extent an agent under a power of
attorney

01:25:43.450 --> 01:25:43.460 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
or a court appointed Guardian can create
 
01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
a transfer on death deed for the person
 
01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
who owns the property or revoke a
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed that's not
 
01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
addressed in the current bill we're
 
01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
looking at how to make that work with
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law uh to make sure there
 
01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
is that option and under what
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances that can be done
 
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
so I agree that this would be a great
 
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
addition uh to our toolkit as eternally
 
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
salic said as an option for the clients
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
where it's appropriate
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
um so I am in agreement philosophically
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
with having a transfer on death deed
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
Statute in New Hampshire but it needs to
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
be revised as as attorneys say like
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
indicated and as I've indicated here as
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to take up the
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
committee's time uh but I'm welcome to
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
questions for attorney Bianco
 
01:26:36.169 --> 01:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
you know what I just have one question
 
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
do you agree with attorney is 30 days a
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
realistic do you agree that the 30 days
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
is about a realistic time for for your
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
group to get back to uh this committee
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
with with your you know your draft so to
 
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
speak I do as she indicated we have a
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
couple of meetings already calendared to
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
do it we were we were close before the
 
01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.010 align:start position:0%
do it we were we were close before the
holidays

01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
holidays
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
um on getting it done so we are very
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
close to to that so I think 30 days is
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
realistic okay great thank you all right
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I just see no other
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee my
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
name is Kathy Stacy I'm the Rockingham
 
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:40.139 align:start position:0%
County Register of Deeds I'm the
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
legislative chief of the New Hampshire
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
Association of counties
 
01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
um I'm speaking I'm not going to
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
reiterate we we have I've given you some
 
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
written testimony with regards to
 
01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
issues that we see with the bill we're
 
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
not in opposition to the bill I mean I
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
think it's I think it would be uh
 
01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
a wonderful opportunity for people we
 
01:27:59.629 --> 01:27:59.639 align:start position:0%
just have questions about some of the
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
terminology or the lack of terminology
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:28:03.719 --> 01:28:04.550 align:start position:0%
and and
um

01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
obviously we're looking to see if uh you
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
know and I'm thankful that these members
 
01:28:13.209 --> 01:28:13.219 align:start position:0%
from the bar got up and spoke because
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
there are I think a lot of issues with
 
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
this I had spoken with representative
 
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
Edwards over the summer about it in
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
hopes that some of the some of these
 
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
things would be addressed but they
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
obviously were not
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is the Registries of
 
01:28:30.649 --> 01:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
deeds will record whatever we're told to
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
record so long as it obviously meets the
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements but we have no
 
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
issue with that whatsoever
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
um the um I will tell you that the state
 
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
of Maine enacted this two years ago and
 
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
when I've spoken with a couple of the
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
registrars up there they said the
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
biggest challenge that they have and
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're they they're having to entertain
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of times you know just
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
like in New Hampshire a lot of people
 
01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
want to do their own paperwork
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's done right doesn't
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
mean it's done wrong and
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
um what they see is a lot of people
 
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
coming in doing transfer on death deeds
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
and within a week two weeks three weeks
 
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.139 align:start position:0%
they come in they're revoking
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
and then they because maybe they get
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
into an argument with whoever they're
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
transferring it to but they see this is
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of repetitive stuff that they see
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
here in Maine and
 
01:29:20.890 --> 01:29:20.900 align:start position:0%
um you know the the question
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
becomes how how is it reported or not
 
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
reported to the towns because one of the
 
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
things in New Hampshire is any deed that
 
01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
gets recorded gets obviously transferred
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
to each community
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
and so I mean there needs to be some
 
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
type of an education piece I think for
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
the assessors here in the state to make
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
sure that they realize that these Deeds
 
01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
go on record but they do not become
 
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
effective until the person actually dies
 
01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
or revokes you know and you know you've
 
01:29:50.570 --> 01:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
got certain mechanisms but they're not
 
01:29:52.450 --> 01:29:52.460 align:start position:0%
really listed in this in the legislation
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
and there need to be protections for
 
01:29:57.169 --> 01:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
people the other thing is
 
01:29:57.179 --> 01:29:57.890 align:start position:0%
people the other thing is
um

01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
I had questions about the terminology
 
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
when we talk about lapses and what
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
lapses and how how certain things affect
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
joint tenants versus a single owner I
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
just think that there needs to be more
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
specification and I'd love to see what
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
is being proposed by this group
 
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
um that probably will address all of
 
01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
these issues because they would
 
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
understand but the big one of the
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
biggest issues and they're absolutely
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
correct is you have title companies who
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
will not uh title insurance companies
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
will not ensure over these transfer and
 
01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:32.219 align:start position:0%
deaf deeds and that's a big problem
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
because you'll have people who may
 
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
inherit on obviously get the get these
 
01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
properties and then what what are they
 
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
going to do with it if they can't
 
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
mortgage it what are they going to do
 
01:30:43.729 --> 01:30:43.739 align:start position:0%
with it if there's a if there's a
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
mortgage on the property it needs to be
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
paid off and they can't utilize that
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
property you know to uh
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
you know get another mortgage
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
so a lot a lot of questions with regards
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
to the bill but you know again the
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
register the registrars are ready to
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
record anything that you you're telling
 
01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
us so long as they you know it complies
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
with the statutes
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative Smith
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you would you be willing um
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
to work with the attorneys who are
 
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
trying to answer the questions that have
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
been raised about this legislation
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes yes and I'm a New
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attorney as well so yes I've
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
been more than happy pleased to hear
 
01:31:22.199 --> 01:31:23.330 align:start position:0%
been more than happy pleased to hear
that

01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
um in that case Mr chair it does seem
 
01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
clear that there are a lot of people out
 
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
here who are sympathetic to the premise
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
of the legislation
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
recognizing a need to refine the
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
language and it is seems ideal that
 
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
those people with specific knowledge
 
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
would work on it before it comes back to
 
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
us for us to consider
 
01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:47.649 align:start position:0%
us for us to consider
um

01:31:47.649 --> 01:31:47.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
improvements sure no I I agree
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
completely I agree thank you very much
 
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
are there other questions for this
 
01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:55.610 align:start position:0%
are there other questions for this
Witness

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:55.620 align:start position:0%

hearing on that bill and we'll turn to
 
01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:19.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
and the prime sponsor representative
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%

ill today but uh fortunately we have
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander who will
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill for us perfect thank
 
01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair members of the committee
 
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
Joe Alexander out of Goffstown
 
01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm just here to introduce the bill
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
on my friend's behalf from Seabrook um
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
he's not feeling well today
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just going to read his
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
testimony and refrain from questions and
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
my support office to the bill
 
01:32:52.129 --> 01:32:52.139 align:start position:0%
um because I'm not sure yet so um HB 290
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
he just wrote several police agencies
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
are considered constables or ex-officio
 
01:32:58.370 --> 01:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
under the New Hampshire statute they
 
01:32:59.810 --> 01:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
include State Police conservation
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
officer legislative security police
 
01:33:04.090 --> 01:33:04.100 align:start position:0%
officer and two of these are statutory
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
statutorily barred from serving civil
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
process that's the state police and
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
conservation officer
 
01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:10.970 align:start position:0%
conservation officer
um

01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
HB 187 will also be heard later today
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
that has to do with this as well so I
 
01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
think we're getting multiple bills about
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
this subject matter
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
um but we're being asked to change the
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
police chapter of the statute to allow
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
civil serving process uh by a police
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
officer so HB 290 does the same thing by
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
changing the statute relative to
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
Constable found in the sheriff and
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
constables chapter currently a constable
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
may only serve writs to them
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
um directed wherein the amount of
 
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
dispute is 75 or less so by removing
 
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
that monetary restriction we allow
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
Constable or a police officer to serve
 
01:33:47.209 --> 01:33:47.219 align:start position:0%
all Ritz that are currently reserved
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
solely for service by Sheriff or deputy
 
01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:50.810 align:start position:0%
solely for service by Sheriff or deputy
sheriff

01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
sheriff
 
01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm just reading the
 
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
testimony so I won't be taking questions
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%

is there something I guess I should say
 
01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:51.120 align:start position:0%

Merrimack Hillsborough County District
 
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.930 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Hillsborough County District
12.

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
12.
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce House Bill 162 of
 
01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
which I'm the prime sponsor
 
01:40:11.209 --> 01:40:11.219 align:start position:0%
it's to support a section related in the
 
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
law to supporting decision making
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
now this bill came to me as a
 
01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:21.500 align:start position:0%
constituent request to further clarify
 
01:40:24.850 --> 01:40:24.860 align:start position:0%
section RSA
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
464 hyphen d
 
01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
which I've distributed to each of you to
 
01:40:35.209 --> 01:40:35.219 align:start position:0%
gain a visual of where this bill would
 
01:40:35.219 --> 01:40:35.930 align:start position:0%
gain a visual of where this bill would
go

01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
in fact I have highlighted in a yellow
 
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
highlight marker on the statute that you
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
all have the precise section where this
 
01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:50.219 align:start position:0%
bill language would be located
 
01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:53.699 align:start position:0%
this chapter of law that you have was
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
part of an Omnibus Bill Senate Bill 134
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
which was adopted in 2021.
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
the bill language House Bill 162 would
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
be placed in the omitted
 
01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
section three
 
01:41:13.149 --> 01:41:13.159 align:start position:0%
lowercase b
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
requiring quote a description of the
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
types of decisions for which the
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
supporter is authorized to assist
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
as you'll see right now in the statute
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
there is nothing located there so the
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
idea is to further enhance and clarify
 
01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
the statute adopted in 2021 by placing
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
in Section 3 lowercase b
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
that the agreement must contain a
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
description of the types of decisions
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
for which the supporter is authorized to
 
01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:49.970 align:start position:0%
for which the supporter is authorized to
assist

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
assist
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
I have a constituent here who requested
 
01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
the bill who can talk further about it
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
and with that I will conclude my
 
01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr chairman
 
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Moon
 
01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
can I ask you uh representative seeing
 
01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:08.699 align:start position:0%
no other questions can I can I just ask
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
and should we infer from the existing
 
01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
law that
 
01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
there was just sort of an oversight in
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
the in when it was originally enacted
 
01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
somehow it didn't the language that
 
01:42:23.330 --> 01:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
should have been in there wasn't put in
 
01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
there or
 
01:42:27.649 --> 01:42:27.659 align:start position:0%
true that that is correct okay and and
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
so do you know I mean and this was what
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
this was this language that you've now
 
01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill is this the same
 
01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
language that was supposed to have gone
 
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
in there originally that I do not know
 
01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.229 align:start position:0%
in there originally that I do not know
okay

01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
all right but true it skips from a to c
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
and a to c okay so um all right
 
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
right I mean to me this makes makes
 
01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
imminent sense especially I've it's rare
 
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
that we see a statute that is drafted to
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
say you know omitted agreed with a
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
section that's for sure
 
01:43:03.649 --> 01:43:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh any questions for the for this
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
witness thank you very much
 
01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:08.930 align:start position:0%
witness thank you very much
representative

01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:26.649 --> 01:43:26.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
how about that now that works good
 
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
morning uh chairman Lynn and the rest of
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
the committee uh thank you for hearing
 
01:43:35.209 --> 01:43:35.219 align:start position:0%
me this morning my name is Bob bevel I
 
01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
live at 12 Blair Road in Merrimack New
 
01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:37.790 align:start position:0%
live at 12 Blair Road in Merrimack New
Hampshire

01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:43:40.970 --> 01:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh I have the dubious honor of assisting
 
01:43:42.169 --> 01:43:42.179 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
Education in uh rewriting the parents
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
guide for the due process uh position
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
for when parents uh have problems with
 
01:43:54.649 --> 01:43:54.659 align:start position:0%
uh the school districts and they need to
 
01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
have Clarity on that as we're developing
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
this new user's guide for the parents to
 
01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
understand that one of the new sections
 
01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:03.179 align:start position:0%
that we had to include has to do with
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
RSA 464d which is the supported decision
 
01:44:09.649 --> 01:44:09.659 align:start position:0%
making process New Hampshire happens to
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
be one of the few states that is
 
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
beginning to implement this as a parent
 
01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:15.659 align:start position:0%
of special needs kids I think this is a
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
fantastic bill in that it allows those
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
children who become adults who do not
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
need full guardianship but need
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
assistance in making decisions to have a
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
code decision capability for them uh as
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
this is new we're still trying to roll
 
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
it out people are trying to understand
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
it uh one of the things that it's going
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
on is to understand what a supported
 
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
decision maker can do and cannot do
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
and unless it's properly enumerated it
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
kind of gets lost in the path so what's
 
01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:49.820 align:start position:0%
happening with it being omitted in 3B
 
01:44:52.609 --> 01:44:52.619 align:start position:0%
some of the language is already there in
 
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
461 D7 1 B and C so I'll point that out
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
in in one B and C it says a description
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
of the type of decisions for which
 
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
supporter is authorized to assist and C
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
says a description of those for which
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
they may not assist
 
01:45:10.689 --> 01:45:10.699 align:start position:0%
part of the problem though is that
 
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
chapter in Section 3 is controlling and
 
01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
so if you think of this like you're
 
01:45:17.209 --> 01:45:17.219 align:start position:0%
trying to do a will or a trust or
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
something like that you have to follow
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
certain elements and the element for
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
what is there is missing so I I don't
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
know if uh representative Mooney gave
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
you a copy of the entire section of the
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
law but if you go down to RSA 464 D16 it
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
has a sample form that can be used
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
that talks about my supporter may help
 
01:45:40.729 --> 01:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
me with obtaining food clothing and
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
shelter taking care of my physical
 
01:45:44.689 --> 01:45:44.699 align:start position:0%
health Mental Health financial matters
 
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
public benefits education and employment
 
01:45:51.649 --> 01:45:51.659 align:start position:0%
where my involvement in this comes from
 
01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
the education in that some of these
 
01:45:58.129 --> 01:45:58.139 align:start position:0%
children will be becoming 17 18 are part
 
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
of their IEPs and when they do this they
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
get to sign off on their IEPs up until
 
01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:06.179 align:start position:0%
the age of 22 as a co-decision maker so
 
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
either parents are operating as their
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
guardians or now under the support of
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
decision making uh that is where it
 
01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
comes under the the child who's now an
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
adult is still in the school district
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
and gets to help make decisions part of
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
that comes in also under what's called
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
vocation in that we try to put these
 
01:46:26.209 --> 01:46:26.219 align:start position:0%
children out into the Working World into
 
01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
different things uh but there's a
 
01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
bifurcation because of an authorization
 
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
for Education support versus doing
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
employment so that's kind of where I'm
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
trying to get that here is that the
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
language is just missing from the
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
omitted when you turn the page in the
 
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill and that was all I was
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
looking for on there the concern is that
 
01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
you're we're going to have parents that
 
01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
are going to be looking to this they're
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
going to look to the form of D16 and
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to be lost and we want to
 
01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:56.820 align:start position:0%
be able to help them do this just as you
 
01:46:58.609 --> 01:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
would an advanced directive or a health
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
care proxy if you're standing in the
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
hospital have a child that's going in
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
for wisdom teeth surgery on Friday
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm wearing the mask so I
 
01:47:06.250 --> 01:47:06.260 align:start position:0%
don't get sick
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
that you know you make a decision at
 
01:47:10.729 --> 01:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
that time it should be able to be made
 
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
at that moment without it being a power
 
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
of attorney or something at that level
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I'll yield to the floor thank you
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
so under a strict reading of it one
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
talks about a supported decision-making
 
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
agreement shall include
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
but it is not mandatory whereas when you
 
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
read three it says a supported decision
 
01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
making agreement is only valid if all
 
01:47:56.930 --> 01:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
and when you say only valid if all
 
01:47:59.930 --> 01:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
the item from one B is not included in
 
01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.570 align:start position:0%
the item from one B is not included in
three

01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:48:05.689 --> 01:48:05.699 align:start position:0%
so your view
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
your language
 
01:48:11.930 --> 01:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
um in one that says the agreement shall
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
include it's not mandatory but it's
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
permissive the judge I can defer to
 
01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
shall can be must you know in in in
 
01:48:21.169 --> 01:48:21.179 align:start position:0%
courts but you know again these are
 
01:48:22.850 --> 01:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
going to be parents that are
 
01:48:24.770 --> 01:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
self-directed doing this to assist their
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
children all I'm looking for is that in
 
01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
the controlling paragraph number three
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
is that it enumerates that when you say
 
01:48:34.729 --> 01:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
that you're doing a supported decision
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
making it's not an all-inclusive that's
 
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
not the point the point is is that this
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
adult child is saying I can make my own
 
01:48:44.450 --> 01:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
decision on which classes I pick but I
 
01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:46.739 align:start position:0%
need help with my banking or I need help
 
01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
deciding on my health care kind of
 
01:48:51.229 --> 01:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
things and it is the adult child
 
01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
who we are empowering here to do that
 
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
and that's all I'm trying to do is to
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that in the controlling
 
01:48:58.810 --> 01:48:58.820 align:start position:0%
paragraph of three the language of one
 
01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh one B is there if the committee feels
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
that it's sufficient as is that's fine
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
but this was the concern we had as I was
 
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
helping draft the parents guide and we
 
01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:11.219 align:start position:0%
were including the new sections about
 
01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
supported decision making because that
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
came up we're there for talking about
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
education but in some of these kids
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
situations from the age of 16 to 22
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
we're also looking for vocational
 
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
support and work support and that came
 
01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
up as is a supported decision maker in
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
education also authorized to speak on
 
01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:31.729 align:start position:0%
education also authorized to speak on
work

01:49:31.729 --> 01:49:31.739 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's where that came from thank you
 
01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
any other questions for this witness so
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
I do have a question thank you and it
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
really it follows up on on what
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Manis says because I
 
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.930 align:start position:0%
representative Manis says because I
think

01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
I think she raises a very valid point is
 
01:49:47.699 --> 01:49:49.250 align:start position:0%
I think she raises a very valid point is
it

01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
in other words I I would think that a
 
01:49:53.689 --> 01:49:53.699 align:start position:0%
court would say shall mean shall not May
 
01:49:57.290 --> 01:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
and so one is kind of mandatory and I
 
01:49:58.850 --> 01:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
and I guess one one of the things that
 
01:50:00.649 --> 01:50:00.659 align:start position:0%
concerns me is
 
01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
if that's true if if section one is
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory and it says that the agreement
 
01:50:07.609 --> 01:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
has to contain a list
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the types of decisions for which
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
support is authorized and a I'm sorry
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
description of the types of decisions
 
01:50:15.590 --> 01:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
for which support is authorized and a
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
description of the types of decisions
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
for which support is not authorized
 
01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
then I'm wondering if in in this piece
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
we should in order to make section one
 
01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:32.699 align:start position:0%
consistent with section three
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
be here
 
01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
ought to say the agreement contains a
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
description of the types of decisions
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
for which the supporter is authorized to
 
01:50:44.810 --> 01:50:44.820 align:start position:0%
assist as well as a description of the
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
types of assistance for which the
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
supporter is not authorized to assist
 
01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
because if I'd be concerned that if you
 
01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
only put you know if you have a conflict
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
between one and three which I assume you
 
01:50:58.850 --> 01:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
don't want to have absolutely I agree
 
01:50:58.860 --> 01:50:59.870 align:start position:0%
don't want to have absolutely I agree
sir

01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
sir
 
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
um I wish I had provided copies of when
 
01:51:06.490 --> 01:51:06.500 align:start position:0%
you get down to 464 D16 it offers a form
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
which is a very good form and you can
 
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
basically say yes or no on the form but
 
01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
what's missing on there is like for on
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
the example it has like supporter one
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
can do this versus supporter two can do
 
01:51:18.239 --> 01:51:20.090 align:start position:0%
can do this versus supporter two can do
that

01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:22.729 --> 01:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
it feels like the form is controlling us
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
there may be decisions that the adult
 
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.659 align:start position:0%
child would like assistance to that are
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
not included here so it feels like they
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
are trapped with what's on that form all
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say is we want to empower
 
01:51:35.450 --> 01:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
this young adult
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
who is making decisions that you and I
 
01:51:40.250 --> 01:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
we just do but we want to give them the
 
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
strength to know that we're going to
 
01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
assist them without it being a power of
 
01:51:46.189 --> 01:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
attorney or controlling them so again if
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
they if I forgot that one of the in one
 
01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
of our meetings somebody included
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
something else that was not in the list
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
of food clothing shelter physical health
 
01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
Mental Health financial public benefits
 
01:51:58.490 --> 01:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
education and employment there was one
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
more and it's so well is that not there
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
it would be something you know where
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
that you could put another one in
 
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh below that that would say
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
I grant so and so the right for x and it
 
01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
would have a yes no where that supporter
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
one could in support of two could I know
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of doing this on the fly but
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
that was the concern is that what
 
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
authorizations do they have this is
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
again being driven by the Department of
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
Education parents guide as to what
 
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
decisions can a supported decision maker
 
01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
make in the moment when they're at an
 
01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
IEP is it only education or Does it
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
include work product or vocation
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
that's where that came from thank you
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
other questions yes uh representative
 
01:52:40.729 --> 01:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
Tripp thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question so are you suggesting
 
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
that we also take a look at the the form
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
and maybe modify that yes sir again I
 
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
literally got this called
 
01:52:53.209 --> 01:52:53.219 align:start position:0%
what time was it like 11 o'clock before
 
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
the deadline of filing it at noon and we
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
we literally filed it at 11 45 because I
 
01:52:59.689 --> 01:52:59.699 align:start position:0%
wasn't even aware and so I did not have
 
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
time to ask to look at D16 but yes
 
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:10.260 align:start position:0%

01:53:47.689 --> 01:53:47.699 align:start position:0%

01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
for the last witness well no not
 
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
specifically the lat witness it was a
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
comment about the bill I was uh oh when
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
we got the
 
01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:01.790 align:start position:0%
we got the
um

01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
when we got this bill we very handily
 
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
we're showing the chapter law which was
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
the bill that created this well which is
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
passed in 20. 2021 and it was part of an
 
01:54:14.209 --> 01:54:14.219 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill and then
 
01:54:16.609 --> 01:54:16.619 align:start position:0%
um there's a house Amendment and it just
 
01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
skipped straight from a to c for no
 
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
apparent reason and it should have been
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
caught during the enrolled build process
 
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
or during the committee of conference or
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
whatever but it wasn't so that's uh and
 
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
so the original Bill the ominous bill in
 
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
the Senate said pretty much exactly what
 
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh represent Moody and the others have
 
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh have suggested so that's not really a
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
question for the previous witness
 
01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
because he was talking about other
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
issues I think but that's
 
01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
just thought I'd it's okay to State it
 
01:54:45.649 --> 01:54:45.659 align:start position:0%
now instead of waiting for the executive
 
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
all right we do have another witness on
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm the
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
policy director at the disability rights
 
01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:01.430 align:start position:0%
policy director at the disability rights
Center

01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
Center
 
01:55:03.169 --> 01:55:03.179 align:start position:0%
um and I wasn't planning on testifying
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
and really I just want to provide some
 
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
information for the committee on this
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
bill this is um the law is something
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
that my predecessor worked on
 
01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
um quite a lot in the 2021 session and
 
01:55:16.330 --> 01:55:16.340 align:start position:0%
the idea was not for someone to delegate
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
decision-making Authority but for there
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
to be an alternative to guardianship
 
01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
which is an opportunity for someone with
 
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
a disability to choose people who they
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
trust to assist them in making their own
 
01:55:31.199 --> 01:55:32.390 align:start position:0%
trust to assist them in making their own
decisions

01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
so it's really not it's not substituted
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
decision making it's to enable someone
 
01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
with a disability to
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
come and have a formal agreement with
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
someone they trust who's knowledgeable
 
01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
to assist them in making decisions so
 
01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
with a student if they want to keep
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
their parents included in their in
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
making decisions about their education
 
01:55:55.970 --> 01:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
they might enter into a supported
 
01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
decision-making agreement which would
 
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
basically say I want my parent to assist
 
01:56:04.010 --> 01:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
me in making my own decisions for how
 
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
what classes I'm going to take you know
 
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
what my IEP is going to look like those
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
kinds of decisions but the decision
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
making Authority rests with the
 
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
individual not with their supporter the
 
01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
supporter provides assistance and what
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
this bill does as written it just
 
01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
basically you know it carries it carries
 
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
over the requirement that these
 
01:56:29.209 --> 01:56:29.219 align:start position:0%
supported decision making agreement just
 
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
State sort of what the what kind of what
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
kind of issues I'm going to be relying
 
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
on my supporter for what kind of
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
decisions I'm going to be relying on my
 
01:56:39.649 --> 01:56:39.659 align:start position:0%
supporter to assist me with
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that this amendment is
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
really necessary I think that section
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
one actually does
 
01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
have the shell and say what needs to be
 
01:56:52.189 --> 01:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
there I think you start getting into the
 
01:56:54.649 --> 01:56:54.659 align:start position:0%
if if we start adding additional
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
Provisions like also having to enumerate
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
all the things that a supporter might
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
not be able to assist with we it might
 
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
end up being very onerous because
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of decisions that we all
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
make every day of our lives right and
 
01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
that we might rely on people to assist
 
01:57:11.209 --> 01:57:11.219 align:start position:0%
us with and I don't know that we want to
 
01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
make completing this form onerous
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
there's a check but there are there's an
 
01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say what you're not going
 
01:57:19.370 --> 01:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
to have a supporter make decisions or
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
help you with decisions about right in
 
01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
the form that's in the statute it's also
 
01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
in the Shell provision
 
01:57:29.089 --> 01:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure it's necessary to amend
 
01:57:31.790 --> 01:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
it at all and I also think we need to be
 
01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
careful That We're Not Gonna
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
Force someone who has a disability who's
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
already engaging supporters to put in
 
01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
more time that's necessary
 
01:57:43.970 --> 01:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
um to enumerate all the things that
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
this person you've asked to support you
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
with may not assist you with because so
 
01:57:52.370 --> 01:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
as an example like if I wanted my if I
 
01:57:56.689 --> 01:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
was a a an 18 year old I wish and I was
 
01:57:58.729 --> 01:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
asking my parents to continue assisting
 
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
me with my education I might not want to
 
01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
list all the things I don't want them to
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
assist me with like decisions around who
 
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
I hang out with or decisions around you
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
know where I live or just you know there
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
could be a huge list there so it could
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
get very onerous for someone in
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
completing one of these forms
 
01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.530 align:start position:0%
completing one of these forms
so

01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:58:19.729 --> 01:58:19.739 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
so you know what I I'm sorry yes
 
01:58:23.570 --> 01:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative page thank you thanks
 
01:58:25.070 --> 01:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
my question the Bill's been in effect
 
01:58:28.970 --> 01:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
for a little bit of time now do you know
 
01:58:30.609 --> 01:58:30.619 align:start position:0%
of any instances where the current
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
statutory Arrangement has caused
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
problems for children or parents I I am
 
01:58:37.129 --> 01:58:37.139 align:start position:0%
not aware of any but that doesn't mean
 
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
that they don't exist I've just not
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
heard of any
 
01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
so can I may I just ask uh the um it
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
seems like the the
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
The Proposal
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
um would would simply be I mean would
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
all it would do is really make section
 
01:58:57.960 --> 01:58:59.570 align:start position:0%
all it would do is really make section
three

01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
it would eliminate the omitted which
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
does seem a little bit untoward and just
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
put in
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
basically the same language that's in
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
subsection one I mean I don't I don't
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
see this as making any
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
substantive change to the law but uh so
 
01:59:20.689 --> 01:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
I'm I mean if I it I mean do you do you
 
01:59:22.129 --> 01:59:22.139 align:start position:0%
think that that would make a substantive
 
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
change to the law if we just sort of put
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
put the same language that's in section
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
one in section three
 
01:59:32.689 --> 01:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
well I I see your point
 
01:59:32.699 --> 01:59:37.850 align:start position:0%
well I I see your point
I

01:59:37.850 --> 01:59:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
like I said my only kids there I I see
 
01:59:42.649 --> 01:59:42.659 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and that it would be
 
01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
perfectly consistent to have the same
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions in both sections of the law
 
01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be really important
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that
 
01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:53.930 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that
um

01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
it's just you know add the if any Clause
 
01:59:59.330 --> 01:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
so that it's exactly the same because we
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to create a situation where
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
someone would really need to think about
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
all the things you know ahead of time
 
02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we might not want someone to assist
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
with and there is an opportunity for in
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
the form to check off some of those
 
02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
things that they might know up front
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative Smith
 
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
um and nature aboards a vacuum could it
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
not be that we could very simply
 
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
um uh call for a re-ordering of uh
 
02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
section three so that c becomes b e n d
 
02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:45.179 align:start position:0%
becomes c and e becomes D and there is
 
02:00:48.169 --> 02:00:48.179 align:start position:0%
no longer anything that says omitted and
 
02:00:52.250 --> 02:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
we can just go on about our business
 
02:00:54.169 --> 02:00:54.179 align:start position:0%
that seems like a lovely eloquent
 
02:00:54.179 --> 02:00:56.270 align:start position:0%
that seems like a lovely eloquent
solution

02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
solution
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
the form includes the provisions that
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
are required in Roman one
 
02:01:06.050 --> 02:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
and you would not have the vacuum that
 
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
we apparently abhor
 
02:01:12.290 --> 02:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you anyone else who
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
desires to testify this and I wonder if
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I I don't see anyone I wonder Miss
 
02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
Moody could I just ask you do you do you
 
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
have a view on on what representative
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
Smith suggested I mean could we just do
 
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
just you know renumber that leave just
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
take the omitted out and just remember
 
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I sort of
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
predicted what the committee options
 
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
would be with regards to this bill with
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
my constituent and that was one so you
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
hit it very good uh so long as it is
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
Crystal Clear oh that's the description
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the types of where the
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
decision-making uh agreement are clear
 
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
in the law I'm good with it
 
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
all right great any other questions for
 
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:02:17.149 --> 02:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm no one else indicating they wish
 
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
to testify I'm going to close the
 
02:02:21.649 --> 02:02:21.659 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 162.
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
and open the hearing on HB 164.
 
02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:28.370 align:start position:0%
and open the hearing on HB 164.
and

02:02:28.370 --> 02:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:30.649 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:02:30.649 --> 02:02:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:33.050 --> 02:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
Let's see we have uh representative
 
02:02:35.330 --> 02:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
Heinz representative
 
02:02:39.229 --> 02:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.209 --> 02:02:47.219 align:start position:0%
these are the ones we've done already
 
02:02:50.450 --> 02:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you to go with her okay
 
02:02:52.810 --> 02:02:52.820 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:57.050 align:start position:0%
all right
fine

02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:02:59.570 --> 02:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative Hines
 
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um your honor and chair and
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh good to be back in front of
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
Judiciary uh so this bill
 
02:03:08.089 --> 02:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
um there's a slight inaccuracy in the uh
 
02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
title uh but it doesn't affect the text
 
02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
of the uh proposal which is correct
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
um so this bill is relative to
 
02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
prohibiting and title says towns but it
 
02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
would also apply to cities and any other
 
02:03:20.209 --> 02:03:20.219 align:start position:0%
unincorporated or otherwise Municipal
 
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
ordinances from criminalizing the right
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
to peacefully and orderly assemble now
 
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
some people might say why do we need
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
this it is in the state constitution I
 
02:03:30.649 --> 02:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
agree I am tracking the language of the
 
02:03:33.169 --> 02:03:33.179 align:start position:0%
State Constitution uh specifically uh
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
part one article 32 that provides people
 
02:03:37.609 --> 02:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
the constitutional right in New
 
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to assemble in a peaceful and
 
02:03:42.770 --> 02:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
orderly uh manner so the reason this is
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
needed is my interpretation of that law
 
02:03:48.649 --> 02:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
um and I guess judge's interpretation of
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
when that applies or slightly at odds uh
 
02:03:54.410 --> 02:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
so by way of background this bill is
 
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
primarily in response to the town of New
 
02:03:59.089 --> 02:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
Field that uh did not like people
 
02:04:02.089 --> 02:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
petitioning and protesting outside of
 
02:04:04.750 --> 02:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's house in the case
 
02:04:07.370 --> 02:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
numerous people were arrested
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
um at least two of those people I
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
believe are here at least one testifying
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about both of them but in
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
that case where people were arrested
 
02:04:16.729 --> 02:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
they were engaged in a peaceful and
 
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
orally protest it was a silent vigil
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
people were walking outside
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
um in public on the sidewalks no traffic
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
was inhibited um they weren't loud
 
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
making noises or otherwise just
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
disrupting things
 
02:04:32.530 --> 02:04:32.540 align:start position:0%
um and the I filed a motion to dismiss
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
arguing various constitutional
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
protections including like I said
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
article 32 but also in that case when it
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
applied to a government official
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
arguably the highest government official
 
02:04:45.770 --> 02:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
in the state I think it's uh further
 
02:04:47.810 --> 02:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
protection under uh the right petition
 
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
petition ultimately the court denied our
 
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss
 
02:04:54.770 --> 02:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
um the everyone who is charged with that
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
ornus was found not guilty
 
02:04:59.089 --> 02:04:59.099 align:start position:0%
um in our particular case we didn't
 
02:05:01.010 --> 02:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
really even present defense at trial
 
02:05:02.810 --> 02:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
hopefully hoping that it would go up to
 
02:05:04.189 --> 02:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
appeal to New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
and validating the statute
 
02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
um so trying to I guess cut this off
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
um by legislative means so this statute
 
02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
um I do Define an orderly manner and the
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
way uh
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
I'm open to any type of redefining
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
orderly manner but I picked various
 
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:23.219 align:start position:0%
parts of the disorderly conduct statute
 
02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
that already defines things that I would
 
02:05:27.410 --> 02:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
consider orderly
 
02:05:31.550 --> 02:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
um or disorderly so if this were passed
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
um people still can't obstruct traffic
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
um they can't obstruct entrances they
 
02:05:38.570 --> 02:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
can't breach the piece they can't be
 
02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
inconvenient annoying make loud noises
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
um disrupting conduct or assemblies
 
02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
those types of things Isis so when
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
applied to things like riots
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
um that certainly would still be
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
prohibited I didn't actually Define
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
peaceful um in this and there's a couple
 
02:05:55.490 --> 02:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
of reasons for that so I think it's
 
02:05:58.010 --> 02:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
difficult to imagine every type of
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
instance that could in fact be peaceful
 
02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
or not so certainly things that would be
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited would be what courts consider
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
true threats so true threats are outside
 
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional protection
 
02:06:11.810 --> 02:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I guess the easiest example of a true
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
threat is if I say I'm going to kill
 
02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
someone so clearly someone cannot go
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
outside anywhere and just have a sign
 
02:06:20.330 --> 02:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
saying I'm going to kill or kill or
 
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
attack or someone's name I think any
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
Court would certainly find that outside
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
of any type of constitutional protection
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
it would be criminal threatening in fact
 
02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
um this wouldn't actually legalize that
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
but like I said the reason I Define
 
02:06:35.089 --> 02:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
peaceful specifically is it's just I
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
think hard to imagine every type of
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
thing dealing with that also the courts
 
02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
um regularly or at least as far as the
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court regularly addresses what
 
02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
constitutes a true threat so in some
 
02:06:49.010 --> 02:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
circumstances it's kind of a gray area
 
02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
whether it's a constitutional and
 
02:06:53.810 --> 02:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
protected right so on this term even the
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of the us is going to deal
 
02:06:57.770 --> 02:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
with the truth right
 
02:06:57.780 --> 02:06:58.910 align:start position:0%
with the truth right
um

02:06:58.910 --> 02:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
so I just didn't want to get into it I
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear my intent behind
 
02:07:05.930 --> 02:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
this is to expand and clarify our
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional right it's not in any way
 
02:07:09.649 --> 02:07:09.659 align:start position:0%
to limit it
 
02:07:09.659 --> 02:07:10.970 align:start position:0%
to limit it
um so

02:07:10.970 --> 02:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
um certainly I think disorderly conduct
 
02:07:15.530 --> 02:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
when it's involving speech
 
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
um can be problematic for the court um
 
02:07:18.770 --> 02:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire Supreme Court in the
 
02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:19.609 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire Supreme Court in the
past

02:07:19.609 --> 02:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:07:22.070 --> 02:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
um in a certain version of the statute I
 
02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
believe in validated part of it and
 
02:07:26.450 --> 02:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
certainly made it clear that like any
 
02:07:28.850 --> 02:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
law cannot actually violate
 
02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:40.070 --> 02:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
and uh I can submit to this um committee
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh the motion to dismissed I filed in
 
02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
that case as well as the judge's order
 
02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
um so that we can get a look at that um
 
02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
and just uh just further addressing uh
 
02:07:49.609 --> 02:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
for those who might not know so New
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is um not a home real estate
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
um so in states that are not a home real
 
02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:57.179 align:start position:0%
estate towns and cities can only do what
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature allows so I did argue
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
that the town was prohibited from doing
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
this in the first place
 
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
um the court disagree with me with that
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
I essentially found Town had Authority
 
02:08:11.209 --> 02:08:11.219 align:start position:0%
um to enact this so he attended this is
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
to prohibitedly
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
make it clear and preempt any town or
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
city from doing anything that would
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
violate the statute it also would
 
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
provide an affirmative defense if
 
02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
someone were to be tried with the
 
02:08:26.089 --> 02:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
a state
 
02:08:26.099 --> 02:08:26.870 align:start position:0%
a state
um

02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
law that violates it um but the primary
 
02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
intent is to prevent towns from doing
 
02:08:31.380 --> 02:08:32.750 align:start position:0%
intent is to prevent towns from doing
this

02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I think this make it very clear to
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
the time that they could not actually do
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
that and in the new field case
 
02:08:41.450 --> 02:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
specifically the town had so originally
 
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
the reason it was adopted is in the past
 
02:08:46.490 --> 02:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
and I didn't represent anyone or I was
 
02:08:48.290 --> 02:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
involved in any of those things but a
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
lot of people I guess I would say were
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
disorderly protesting in front of the
 
02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
governor's house so if people are
 
02:08:57.169 --> 02:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
showing up and
 
02:08:59.330 --> 02:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
I mean the easiest example I think is
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
certain loud noises that would be
 
02:09:03.290 --> 02:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
outside constitutional protection
 
02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I think that was already the town had
 
02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
ample Avenues to already address that so
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's the disorderly comic
 
02:09:12.530 --> 02:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
statute as it was written or various
 
02:09:14.450 --> 02:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
other things so like I said this this
 
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
early conic statue of this build
 
02:09:19.370 --> 02:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
um well or else I were to pass it still
 
02:09:21.550 --> 02:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
prohibits the
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
non the disruptive kind so
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
um 2C would still be in effect
 
02:09:28.129 --> 02:09:28.139 align:start position:0%
um and three would still be in a fact
 
02:09:30.290 --> 02:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
three dealing with loud noises so is
 
02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
again limited to peaceful and orderly
 
02:09:36.169 --> 02:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
assembling and protesting
 
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
um and that is explicitly what our state
 
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
constitution provides yeah I'd be happy
 
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
02:09:46.370 --> 02:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:48.589 --> 02:09:48.599 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I'm sorry representative Morgan
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
yes you kind of alluded to it but uh
 
02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
many of the same individuals involved in
 
02:09:58.129 --> 02:09:58.139 align:start position:0%
the new Fields protest I guess we're
 
02:09:59.689 --> 02:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
also uh
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
arrested in uh I'm not sure whether it
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
would have been Goffstown or Manchester
 
02:10:05.209 --> 02:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
whatever decided the Town Line the New
 
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Institute of politics is when
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
they had the executive Council uh
 
02:10:12.290 --> 02:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
Chambers so it's your bill apply to uh
 
02:10:15.530 --> 02:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
meetings such as the things
 
02:10:17.450 --> 02:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
things such as executive Council
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
meetings or is this or where's the uh
 
02:10:22.250 --> 02:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
where's the uh the line between what
 
02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
this bill covers and what it doesn't yes
 
02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd have to have to see what the
 
02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:26.570 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd have to have to see what the
complaint

02:10:26.570 --> 02:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
um alleges so if the complaints alleging
 
02:10:30.770 --> 02:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
that people are acting in a disorderly
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
fashion so if you were inner if a bunch
 
02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
of people came in and started
 
02:10:37.250 --> 02:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
interrupting this proceeding I don't
 
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
think that would count as an orderly
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
manner in under our present statute
 
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
specifically three already deals with
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
breach piece inconvenience annoyance
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
including loud noises and specifically
 
02:10:48.719 --> 02:10:50.209 align:start position:0%
including loud noises and specifically
disrupting

02:10:50.209 --> 02:10:50.219 align:start position:0%
disrupting
 
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
um so in those particular facts I would
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
say no it would not prohibit that but if
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
people were outside of that place with
 
02:10:59.930 --> 02:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
some signs picketing I would suggest yes
 
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
those people should not be charged with
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
a crime
 
02:11:02.639 --> 02:11:03.950 align:start position:0%
a crime
thanks

02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
what was the basis for the motion to
 
02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
dismiss for the allowance of the motion
 
02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
to dismiss
 
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court has a law that on
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
its face
 
02:11:19.679 --> 02:11:20.629 align:start position:0%
its face
um

02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
that this law in space would be
 
02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:23.629 align:start position:0%
that this law in space would be
constitutional

02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:11:25.129 --> 02:11:25.139 align:start position:0%
um I think it's distinguishable I did
 
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
try to distinguish it so the case that
 
02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:28.310 align:start position:0%
try to distinguish it so the case that
um

02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court relying on
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
basically allowed under limited
 
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances people to be criminalized
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
for potentially protesting in a
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood I think this
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
statute as applied was different because
 
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
it was directed at the governor so the
 
02:11:48.169 --> 02:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
basis of the dismissal was that specific
 
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court case and I would add
 
02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:51.109 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court case and I would add
that

02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
um the U.S Supreme Court basically sets
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards New Hampshire we
 
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
have our own Constitution specifically
 
02:12:00.169 --> 02:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
article 32 addresses this and cert more
 
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
so I I just want to make sure I'm uh so
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
did the did the what court was this that
 
02:12:16.609 --> 02:12:16.619 align:start position:0%
denied the motion to dismiss it was a
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
superior court a circuit court it was
 
02:12:22.729 --> 02:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
District Court uh Brent and was there an
 
02:12:24.890 --> 02:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
opinion written by the court uh yes
 
02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
there was and I will submit that to you
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
saying that saying that what this that
 
02:12:31.609 --> 02:12:31.619 align:start position:0%
it was not unconstitutional
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay yes at the motion to dismiss stage
 
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
and a lot of my arguments
 
02:12:40.729 --> 02:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
um applied to the essentially
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
I think the main thing the core was
 
02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
Finding was that it was constitutional
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
science based but um the court in my
 
02:12:50.089 --> 02:12:50.099 align:start position:0%
opinion deferred on the as applied and
 
02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to wait to the point of trial to
 
02:12:53.689 --> 02:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
address that issue so ultimately it
 
02:12:55.490 --> 02:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
wasn't well it was addressing trial with
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
a not guilty verdict
 
02:12:59.930 --> 02:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
um but there wasn't any specific binding
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
after trial or after testimony as to
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether it was constitutional as applied
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
to the case
 
02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
so I just I guess I have one of the
 
02:13:12.649 --> 02:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
questions under if under under this if
 
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
we were to enact this as a law suppose
 
02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:16.910 align:start position:0%
we were to enact this as a law suppose
that

02:13:16.910 --> 02:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
um whether it's in new fields or
 
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
wherever uh you know any anywhere
 
02:13:24.169 --> 02:13:24.179 align:start position:0%
suppose that a people are unhappy with
 
02:13:24.179 --> 02:13:25.189 align:start position:0%
suppose that a people are unhappy with
some

02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:13:26.810 --> 02:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
person who lives at a particular address
 
02:13:29.050 --> 02:13:29.060 align:start position:0%
and they decide that they're going to
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
walk a picket line peacefully and
 
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
quietly at two o'clock in the morning
 
02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
can they do that
 
02:13:38.209 --> 02:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
I think if it's peacefully and quietly
 
02:13:38.219 --> 02:13:38.990 align:start position:0%
I think if it's peacefully and quietly
yes

02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:13:41.569 --> 02:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
um if it's disrupting people
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
um either with it doesn't have to be
 
02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
noise I guess if it were
 
02:13:46.970 --> 02:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
um even sounds I would suggest that
 
02:13:49.129 --> 02:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
that's still inconvenience um and the
 
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
court could take into consideration the
 
02:13:52.609 --> 02:13:52.619 align:start position:0%
time of night people don't want light
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
shined into their house or if you're
 
02:13:56.510 --> 02:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
somehow Awakening people
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
um I would suggest that that would still
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
be some type of breach of peace or
 
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
inconvenience or annoyance so I think
 
02:14:05.930 --> 02:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
um it would depend on any specific facts
 
02:14:07.609 --> 02:14:07.619 align:start position:0%
but I think if someone's just walking
 
02:14:10.250 --> 02:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
quietly outside of someone's house while
 
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
they're sleeping I don't think that's
 
02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:12.890 align:start position:0%
they're sleeping I don't think that's
really

02:14:12.890 --> 02:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:14:14.569 --> 02:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
I think that person's the least likely
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
to even know about it and be impacted by
 
02:14:19.129 --> 02:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
itself I think that would be a poor way
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
to go about that speech but
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
um I guess under certain circumstances
 
02:14:25.609 --> 02:14:25.619 align:start position:0%
it would protect that speech all right
 
02:14:29.209 --> 02:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:31.370 --> 02:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
so in this case that you're mentioning
 
02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
was the reason were they on the street
 
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
or were they actually on his property
 
02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:37.430 align:start position:0%
or were they actually on his property
because

02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
that's his private residence so not a
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
government property correct correct so
 
02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.290 align:start position:0%
government property correct correct so
yes

02:14:44.290 --> 02:14:44.300 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:14:46.609 --> 02:14:46.619 align:start position:0%
wait a minute I'll help you if somebody
 
02:14:48.109 --> 02:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
else wants to testify you'll have
 
02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:49.619 align:start position:0%
perfect opportunity to do that sir but
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
not right now yep so the ordinance has
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
written a plot and I argued also the
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
ordinance was block has included things
 
02:14:57.530 --> 02:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
that they also can include but for the
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
facts of the matter um no it was on
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
public property a sidewalk
 
02:15:05.330 --> 02:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
um very s factually specific to the
 
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
governor's house is there is a private
 
02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
right-of-way that goes along his prop
 
02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:11.209 align:start position:0%
right-of-way that goes along his prop
basically

02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:15:13.129 --> 02:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
among sort of dividing his property
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
between things
 
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:20.569 --> 02:15:20.579 align:start position:0%
that there was no trespassing I guess so
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't prevent trespassing that's
 
02:15:24.169 --> 02:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
a way to answer your question so it
 
02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
would only apply to public you can't go
 
02:15:28.750 --> 02:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
on someone's front yard and start
 
02:15:31.250 --> 02:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
protesting okay thank you that was the
 
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
question is this this seems like it only
 
02:15:35.930 --> 02:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
applies to public land and I wanted to
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that that was the case thank
 
02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this witness yes
 
02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative Turner
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and and this made me my lack of
 
02:15:47.330 --> 02:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
understanding of of the law um
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding that the the
 
02:15:51.229 --> 02:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution essentially encompasses
 
02:15:54.050 --> 02:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
what the law that you're proposing is
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
also trying to Encompass and I would
 
02:15:58.850 --> 02:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
assume that the a constitutional
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
provision would supersede
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so is this just related to the way
 
02:16:07.609 --> 02:16:07.619 align:start position:0%
that if the court applied the law or and
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
is there any other instance where we
 
02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
sort of have a law that sort of codifies
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I am
 
02:16:19.970 --> 02:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
yes used to it being the other way
 
02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:24.119 align:start position:0%
around but in this case the town passed
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
an ordinance knowing about the
 
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution many people at least I
 
02:16:30.050 --> 02:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
think was like seven or eight people on
 
02:16:31.970 --> 02:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
that specific night were arrested for
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
violating an orange so police didn't
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
think if I lay the Constitution
 
02:16:37.969 --> 02:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
ultimately an attorney filed a motion to
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
dismiss argument violation a judge
 
02:16:42.349 --> 02:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
disagreed with me um so maybe I'm the
 
02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
outlier but numerous people are just
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
finding that the specific at least the
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
statute itself did not violate the
 
02:16:51.049 --> 02:16:51.059 align:start position:0%
constitution so I can't I don't think I
 
02:16:52.610 --> 02:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
can further amend the Constitution to
 
02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
make it clear so but we can
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
um make it clear specifically when it's
 
02:16:59.629 --> 02:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
being applied to a town the state is
 
02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
well within its authority to preempt
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
towns town you cannot do that
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
I hope I answer your question
 
02:17:09.709 --> 02:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you may have said
 
02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:17.450 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you may have said
what

02:17:17.450 --> 02:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
the people that were protesting were
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
charged with but uh I may not have been
 
02:17:25.790 --> 02:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
listening or I didn't write it down
 
02:17:28.730 --> 02:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that please yes I will
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
submit the actual complaint and text of
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
newfields town ordinance but basically
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
it was prohibiting
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
I forget to use the word prototype I
 
02:17:39.169 --> 02:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
believe it's protest my business
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
template but essentially protesting
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
outside of a residential area that's
 
02:17:45.889 --> 02:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
essentially their broad statute didn't
 
02:17:47.929 --> 02:17:47.939 align:start position:0%
include any limitations
 
02:17:50.450 --> 02:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
um obviously every law Town ordinance or
 
02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise is limited by the Constitution
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh but it was a very broad statue
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
um basically said on protest in any
 
02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
manner outside of a resonance
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
yes so you have written testimony that
 
02:18:07.250 --> 02:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
you're going to be giving us uh yes I
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
will submit that and the reason I didn't
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
do it ahead of time is I try to listen
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
to everyone else's comments and so I can
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
add further too
 
02:18:15.650 --> 02:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
testimony that obvious to me but I will
 
02:18:17.450 --> 02:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
submit the town ordinance a question uh
 
02:18:18.889 --> 02:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
my motion is dismissed I filed as well
 
02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
as the Court's order in that case thank
 
02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:22.610 align:start position:0%
as the Court's order in that case thank
you

02:18:22.610 --> 02:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:18:25.009 --> 02:18:25.019 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
does that ordinance appear to be in
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
direct violation of the constitution in
 
02:18:35.570 --> 02:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
my opinion yes okay is anything being
 
02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
done about that ordinance
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
it can't be at this point because it's
 
02:18:42.290 --> 02:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
moot because everyone was found not
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
guilty so this is my response to making
 
02:18:46.730 --> 02:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
something being done about it
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
may I yes so in other words the
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
ordinance still stands in that
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
particular town so if that ordinance was
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
in my town
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I went and peacefully assembled
 
02:19:02.450 --> 02:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
outside of
 
02:19:04.370 --> 02:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
um my next door neighbor's house which
 
02:19:07.849 --> 02:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
is a residence I could be arrested if I
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
stepped off the sidewalk
 
02:19:14.290 --> 02:19:14.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.810 --> 02:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh so if first your town would have to
 
02:19:19.969 --> 02:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
pass an order it's assuming they did yes
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
assuming they used the language that the
 
02:19:23.690 --> 02:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court allowed
 
02:19:23.700 --> 02:19:24.889 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court allowed
um

02:19:24.889 --> 02:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
I think yes I I would agree there's a
 
02:19:30.110 --> 02:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
difference between a sidewalk and a
 
02:19:32.089 --> 02:19:32.099 align:start position:0%
street um obviously you also can't step
 
02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
on a person's property
 
02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
um so yeah any other town or city even
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
um could adopt a similar ordinance
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I would expect the attorney would
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
challenge it on constitutional grounds
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
and um so district court cases aren't
 
02:19:46.490 --> 02:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
binding on other judges um I think
 
02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
judges certainly would give it deference
 
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
and look at the decision taken into
 
02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:51.469 align:start position:0%
and look at the decision taken into
consideration

02:19:51.469 --> 02:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:19:52.969 --> 02:19:52.979 align:start position:0%
um I would hope there would be a split
 
02:19:55.370 --> 02:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
and a judge would find that particular
 
02:19:57.889 --> 02:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
statue unconstitutional But ultimately
 
02:19:59.810 --> 02:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
without the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
addressing this specific issue the next
 
02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
best remedy in my opinion is having
 
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislature essentially overriding the
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
towns thank you
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Patel
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
so if that
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
um ordinance is still taking place and
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's a constitutional
 
02:20:22.969 --> 02:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
right to be able to do it didn't stop
 
02:20:25.310 --> 02:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
them from putting in that town ordinance
 
02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
how would this RSA stop them from having
 
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
that ordinance what is different here
 
02:20:33.050 --> 02:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
yep uh two ways I think it just broadly
 
02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
clarifies an affirmative defense but
 
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
second so towns can only do what the
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
state allows them to and one thing's
 
02:20:41.570 --> 02:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
what's called preemption
 
02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
um so we have various statutes that do
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
that off top of my hand Firearms being
 
02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
one of them we specifically tell us the
 
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
towns you cannot address any law dealing
 
02:20:52.490 --> 02:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
with this so if the legislature comes in
 
02:20:53.929 --> 02:20:53.939 align:start position:0%
and specifically tells the town or city
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
you cannot do this
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
um of course I don't think there's any
 
02:20:59.570 --> 02:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
question I don't even think a town would
 
02:20:59.580 --> 02:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
question I don't even think a town would
try

02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
try
 
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
02:21:03.060 --> 02:21:04.070 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
Witness

02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative De Lorenzo thank you
 
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just one quick one uh
 
02:21:11.809 --> 02:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
representative Heinz um who defines
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
peacefully and or orderly assemblance
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean ultimately I had to make
 
02:21:20.090 --> 02:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
a judgment call of that if the uh and
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
like I said I didn't want to limit it so
 
02:21:24.889 --> 02:21:24.899 align:start position:0%
um if courts were to like I said you
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
still have constitutional right to do
 
02:21:28.610 --> 02:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
that so I'm happy with any um changes
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
that the committee might feel is a
 
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
better way to do it so I just didn't
 
02:21:33.050 --> 02:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
Define peacefully because I think it's
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
hard to Encompass everything that might
 
02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
include that
 
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
um and orderly I just this is in the
 
02:21:41.210 --> 02:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
disorderly comic statue so I tried to
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
pick things in the statute that I
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
thought were disorderly and we might not
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise want to allow so
 
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
um it was just
 
02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
me guessing it what I feel includes
 
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
those things but the committee wants to
 
02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
make any uh changes to those language I
 
02:21:57.650 --> 02:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
would certainly support that
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative Heinz
 
02:22:06.290 --> 02:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm next gonna call on
 
02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:06.950 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm next gonna call on
um

02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh Frank negus State I hope I'm
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
pronouncing this correctly negative
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
Staples legal Staples yes sir yes
 
02:22:18.590 --> 02:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
Staples apologize for uh
 
02:22:21.770 --> 02:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
my comments there I would like to put
 
02:22:23.690 --> 02:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
the board on notice or the people that I
 
02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
do have had trauma and I get loud
 
02:22:27.479 --> 02:22:28.670 align:start position:0%
do have had trauma and I get loud
sometimes

02:22:28.670 --> 02:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
and distracted so I may need a little
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
bit more time there's a lot of things
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
here that you guys were asking uh
 
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
attorney Hines that he's not aware of I
 
02:22:40.929 --> 02:22:40.939 align:start position:0%
am the organizer of the original
 
02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
protests in front of the governor's
 
02:22:46.370 --> 02:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
house no one ever stepped foot on his
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
property there was a public cul-de-sac
 
02:22:51.530 --> 02:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
in the cul-de-sac where he lives there's
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
a small park right there in that
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
cul-de-sac and that's where all of the
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
protests were held and that's where the
 
02:23:01.969 --> 02:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
candlelight vigil was held where Skyler
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
Bennett was arrested for trespassing
 
02:23:07.370 --> 02:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
into disorderly conduct the governor
 
02:23:10.849 --> 02:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
used that arrest that he was found not
 
02:23:14.450 --> 02:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
guilty of to cancel his inauguration and
 
02:23:17.450 --> 02:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
publicly state that there were armed
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
protesters in his backyard
 
02:23:23.710 --> 02:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
which was a lie a bold-faced lie
 
02:23:26.809 --> 02:23:26.819 align:start position:0%
additionally his brother Michael sununu
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
is the one who passed this town
 
02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
ordinance the town ordinance itself
 
02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
derives its power from a motorboat
 
02:23:36.650 --> 02:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
Muffler statue
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay it's right there in the town
 
02:23:41.290 --> 02:23:41.300 align:start position:0%
ordinance and the town ordinance itself
 
02:23:44.929 --> 02:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
does not define what is picketing it's
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
picketing in a residential neighborhood
 
02:23:49.969 --> 02:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
is the town ordinance okay I've been to
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
the police station the newfields town
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
hall to ask them what is picketing the
 
02:23:57.889 --> 02:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
officer directed me to come back I went
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
back and I actually bumped into Michael
 
02:24:02.469 --> 02:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
sununu I have a video of the entire
 
02:24:06.770 --> 02:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
encounter and he was unable to explain
 
02:24:09.170 --> 02:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
what is picketing where I could and
 
02:24:11.450 --> 02:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
couldn't pick it in new fields and he
 
02:24:13.849 --> 02:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
said we were allowed to pick it but we
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
should talk to the chief of police I
 
02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
tried to talk to the police chief of
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
police I got part of the conversation he
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
called me I have part of that on video
 
02:24:24.889 --> 02:24:24.899 align:start position:0%
he's unable to Define he keeps referring
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
to this uh denial of the motion to
 
02:24:32.170 --> 02:24:32.180 align:start position:0%
dismiss from attorney Hines to justify
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
this town ordinance even though Schuyler
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
Bennett was ultimately found not guilty
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
they're referring to the the denial of
 
02:24:43.730 --> 02:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
this on the Constitutional grounds of
 
02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
that case so and another thing if it
 
02:24:51.290 --> 02:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
isn't disorderly conduct which is pretty
 
02:24:54.050 --> 02:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
much a catch-all for anything if it's
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
not disorderly then it has to be orderly
 
02:25:00.889 --> 02:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
by Nature okay so if you can't be
 
02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
arrested for disorderly
 
02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
then they they shouldn't this I mean
 
02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
this ordinance is absolutely ridiculous
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
and when I represented myself at trial I
 
02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
have this on video as well Trooper state
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
trooper dots testified that AG at the
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
time McDonald
 
02:25:23.570 --> 02:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
gave them instructions on how to enforce
 
02:25:25.010 --> 02:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
the ordinance
 
02:25:28.429 --> 02:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
okay what were those instructions we
 
02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
don't know I've been trying to find
 
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
Clarity on this the last person to get a
 
02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
ticket stood in the cul-de-sac by
 
02:25:37.550 --> 02:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
himself while there was a train of
 
02:25:40.130 --> 02:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
vehicles with Dawn Baldock honking
 
02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
around the cul-de-sac making noise Flags
 
02:25:45.050 --> 02:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
waving driving back and forth back and
 
02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
forth none of them got in trouble none
 
02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
of them got ticketed my friend Brian got
 
02:25:52.490 --> 02:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
ticketed for picketing in front of the
 
02:25:54.410 --> 02:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
governor's house and then that case was
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
eventually dismissed and he was never
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
even received notice of it and that's
 
02:26:00.410 --> 02:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
when we went to New fields to try to get
 
02:26:04.270 --> 02:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
clarity so I also have a supreme court
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
appeal that McDonald had to recuse
 
02:26:10.130 --> 02:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
himself of because I was arrested for
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
disorderly conduct after the fact I went
 
02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
back after the vigil it's fine I killed
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
I told you I'm disabled so I'm asking
 
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
for a reasonable accommodation thank you
 
02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:21.650 align:start position:0%
for a reasonable accommodation thank you
um

02:26:21.650 --> 02:26:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:26.090 --> 02:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
so we went back and I was arrested
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
after I was ticketed there was at least
 
02:26:31.730 --> 02:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 of us singing Christmas carols
 
02:26:34.969 --> 02:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the day and
 
02:26:37.550 --> 02:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
they said we're all going to get tickets
 
02:26:40.370 --> 02:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
and then there's State Police and the
 
02:26:42.290 --> 02:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
Town Police talking to each other I got
 
02:26:44.690 --> 02:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
it all on video and I S and we're
 
02:26:46.250 --> 02:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
waiting and waiting we go back we say
 
02:26:48.349 --> 02:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hey where's these tickets they give me a
 
02:26:51.530 --> 02:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
ticket only me a ticket I say okay and
 
02:26:53.210 --> 02:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
then I try to get this state trooper
 
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
next to him who's playing clothes with a
 
02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
mask on to identify himself because he
 
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
was the one that this guy was talking to
 
02:27:01.570 --> 02:27:01.580 align:start position:0%
I said who are you sir identify yourself
 
02:27:04.610 --> 02:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
and then this new Fields town hall guy
 
02:27:07.309 --> 02:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
arrest me for disorderly conduct doesn't
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
tell me any lawful order to stop what
 
02:27:12.650 --> 02:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
I'm doing sure you know I I I we want to
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
hear what you have to say but you seem
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
it it needs to be related to this to
 
02:27:19.990 --> 02:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
this bill it is related to this bill
 
02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
hang on hang on you have to listen to me
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
when I'm talking sure okay all right it
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
seems like you're going into you know
 
02:27:31.010 --> 02:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
sort of the the particulars of your case
 
02:27:34.670 --> 02:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
that kind of go beyond what's no this is
 
02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
why you were asking about the previous
 
02:27:39.889 --> 02:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
protests never were there any arrests
 
02:27:41.330 --> 02:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
for disorderly at any of the previous
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
protests which were supposedly so loud
 
02:27:45.050 --> 02:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
and boisterous
 
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
never once okay instead they decided to
 
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
create this town ordinance off of a
 
02:27:53.690 --> 02:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
motorboat Muffler law built for the
 
02:27:56.450 --> 02:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
waterways to Target picketing in a
 
02:28:00.410 --> 02:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood okay so this
 
02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
law is nullified it is unconstitutional
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
and it cannot be enforced that's why the
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
judge keeps finding everyone not guilty
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why they had to arrest me for
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
disorderly conduct for nothing for
 
02:28:15.889 --> 02:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
peacefully protesting and then asking
 
02:28:19.130 --> 02:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
why this this guy who this guy is who's
 
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
who's giving the Town Police
 
02:28:22.849 --> 02:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
instructions on how to enforce this law
 
02:28:25.849 --> 02:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
so this is a criminal conspiracy and
 
02:28:28.849 --> 02:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
there should be in 100 investigation on
 
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
this I will email the video of the the
 
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
encounter that I had with Michael sununu
 
02:28:37.309 --> 02:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
where he just unable he's the one who
 
02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
signed off on this town ordinance if
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
anyone could explain it he can but he
 
02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:44.690 align:start position:0%
anyone could explain it he can but he
couldn't

02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
okay all right so if you have any
 
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions oh and I would like to hark
 
02:28:52.010 --> 02:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
back to Governor Wentworth this is
 
02:28:54.530 --> 02:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
historical facts of New Hampshire look
 
02:28:56.690 --> 02:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
up Governor Wentworth the first governor
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do you know what happened
 
02:28:58.730 --> 02:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
to him
 
02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
protesters came outside his house with a
 
02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:03.590 align:start position:0%
protesters came outside his house with a
cannon

02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
cannon
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
and he took off out the back door and he
 
02:29:09.290 --> 02:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
went to Canada and never came back
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
okay so protesting in front of our
 
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
political uh Representatives our public
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
servants houses to hold them accountable
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
is what it's all about if we're out in
 
02:29:21.170 --> 02:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
front of your house because we know
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
where you live and that's not a threat
 
02:29:26.510 --> 02:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's a matter of public record okay we
 
02:29:28.370 --> 02:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
know where you live if we're outside
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
your house pissed off there's a reason
 
02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:33.660 align:start position:0%
for it and maybe you should listen to
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
the people who you're supposed to
 
02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:36.770 align:start position:0%
the people who you're supposed to
represent

02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
right questions for this Witness
 
02:29:40.849 --> 02:29:40.859 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions yes
 
02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:47.809 --> 02:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
you've referred several times to Michael
 
02:29:51.770 --> 02:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
sununu so what what was what office and
 
02:29:53.809 --> 02:29:53.819 align:start position:0%
what position of authority did he hold
 
02:29:55.849 --> 02:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
in the town of new fields or effort he's
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
the Town Administrator
 
02:29:59.929 --> 02:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you he should
 
02:30:02.330 --> 02:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
have recused himself as being the
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
brother of Michael sununu and the
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
administrator the sununa administration
 
02:30:09.469 --> 02:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
at the time reached out to the town we
 
02:30:11.210 --> 02:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
have that proven New Hampshire Journal
 
02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
proved that and there was a reporter
 
02:30:15.530 --> 02:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
who's here a reporter who was covering
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
the vigil he was arrested and charged as
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
well and that is unacceptable absolutely
 
02:30:23.090 --> 02:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
unacceptable other questions for this
 
02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:24.230 align:start position:0%
unacceptable other questions for this
Witness

02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
so may I simplify this and tell me if
 
02:30:34.010 --> 02:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong it's my understanding that
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
is being put forth because you and
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
others feel that your constitutional
 
02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
rights were violated by an ordinance
 
02:30:49.130 --> 02:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
that was put into place
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
that perhaps prohibited your
 
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights from being
 
02:30:58.429 --> 02:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
allowed is that simple I as far as I
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
understand it I'm not Dan Hines he's the
 
02:31:03.770 --> 02:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
one who put the bill forward this bill
 
02:31:06.530 --> 02:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
um is put forward to
 
02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's re it's rewriting the
 
02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution this is the problem we
 
02:31:13.070 --> 02:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
already have the Constitution that's not
 
02:31:15.530 --> 02:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
being followed and we are whittling it
 
02:31:17.450 --> 02:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
away with all these statutes we need
 
02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
less and less and less of these statutes
 
02:31:22.969 --> 02:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
to have more freedom laws create crime
 
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
simple math zero laws equals zero crime
 
02:31:29.690 --> 02:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not advocating for zero laws but
 
02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's how it works so you can't
 
02:31:34.969 --> 02:31:34.979 align:start position:0%
criminalize everything that you don't
 
02:31:36.889 --> 02:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
like especially if there's a disorderly
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
conduct statute that's there that can be
 
02:31:41.750 --> 02:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
used they could have arrested anybody
 
02:31:44.570 --> 02:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
for disorderly conduct at any time other
 
02:31:46.969 --> 02:31:46.979 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
02:31:48.770 --> 02:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much sir thank
 
02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:49.730 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much sir thank
you

02:31:49.730 --> 02:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:51.230 align:start position:0%
you
uh

02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
I hope I'm pronouncing this correctly
 
02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:54.530 align:start position:0%
I hope I'm pronouncing this correctly
notch

02:31:54.530 --> 02:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
notch
 
02:31:54.540 --> 02:31:57.790 align:start position:0%
notch
graze

02:31:57.790 --> 02:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:01.570 --> 02:32:01.580 align:start position:0%
craze for the municipal Association I uh
 
02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
can't remember if I've introduced myself
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
before this year it's been a little busy
 
02:32:07.670 --> 02:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
um we are a voluntary membership
 
02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
organization comprised of the 234 cities
 
02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
and towns of New Hampshire we provide
 
02:32:16.250 --> 02:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
legal advice uh to cities and towns we
 
02:32:17.929 --> 02:32:17.939 align:start position:0%
provide training we did about 80
 
02:32:20.090 --> 02:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
training and education events last year
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
we also come here and Advocate on behalf
 
02:32:24.889 --> 02:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
of cities and towns we are opposed to
 
02:32:26.809 --> 02:32:26.819 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:32:29.330 --> 02:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
um it appears to be a limit on the
 
02:32:30.770 --> 02:32:30.780 align:start position:0%
ability of municipalities to regulate
 
02:32:33.889 --> 02:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
the time place and are put into place uh
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
time place and manner restrictions on
 
02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:38.090 align:start position:0%
time place and manner restrictions on
um

02:32:38.090 --> 02:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:40.730 --> 02:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
I guess public Gatherings
 
02:32:44.330 --> 02:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
um these these type of restrictions have
 
02:32:47.450 --> 02:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
been litigated extensively over many
 
02:32:50.450 --> 02:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
many decades our New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:32:52.730 --> 02:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
Court has addressed this multiple times
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
we have very clear case law about that
 
02:32:58.910 --> 02:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and we believe that those judicial
 
02:33:02.090 --> 02:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
decisions are correct we don't believe
 
02:33:05.330 --> 02:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
that it is appropriate to upend the
 
02:33:07.370 --> 02:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
apple cart and
 
02:33:11.690 --> 02:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
um change what the existing law is
 
02:33:14.690 --> 02:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
um it as I understand from the
 
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
discussion today uh this bill was filed
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
um as a consequence of
 
02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
some enforcement actions taking place in
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
New Fields I'm not familiar with those
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't want to speak to those
 
02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:32.510 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't want to speak to those
specifically

02:33:32.510 --> 02:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm unclear at this point in time
 
02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
whether the bill sponsor indicated that
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
he had
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
asked the court for an as applied
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
challenge to that ordinance and as
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
applied challenge is one where
 
02:33:50.389 --> 02:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh essentially the defense and please
 
02:33:52.130 --> 02:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong on describing
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
this uh uh representative Lynn
 
02:33:57.650 --> 02:33:57.660 align:start position:0%
um but an as applied challenge is one
 
02:33:57.660 --> 02:33:58.490 align:start position:0%
um but an as applied challenge is one
where

02:33:58.490 --> 02:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:34:00.770 --> 02:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
um the defense asked the court to find
 
02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
that the law
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
is written is unconstitutional as
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
applied to the specific facts in that
 
02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:07.809 align:start position:0%
applied to the specific facts in that
case

02:34:07.809 --> 02:34:07.819 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:34:10.990 --> 02:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
generally speaking that's a little bit
 
02:34:15.170 --> 02:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
uh of a lesser standard than an overall
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
challenge to an ordinance which is a
 
02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
facial challenge which means that
 
02:34:21.530 --> 02:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
essentially you're saying that this law
 
02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
would never be constitutional in any
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
circumstance I wasn't exactly clear on
 
02:34:28.130 --> 02:34:28.140 align:start position:0%
the testimony whether that was asked for
 
02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
or not but I would assume that whatever
 
02:34:33.650 --> 02:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
court documents he files with the
 
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
committee would clarify that I'm happy
 
02:34:37.370 --> 02:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
to take any questions that you may have
 
02:34:40.490 --> 02:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
02:34:43.010 --> 02:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative breeson
 
02:34:44.570 --> 02:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you sir for
 
02:34:47.809 --> 02:34:47.819 align:start position:0%
your taking our questions uh line three
 
02:34:52.010 --> 02:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
of the bill paragraph two excuse me uh
 
02:34:53.929 --> 02:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral seven
 
02:34:55.610 --> 02:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
it says notwithstanding any other
 
02:34:57.889 --> 02:34:57.899 align:start position:0%
provision of law
 
02:34:59.929 --> 02:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
it shall not be a crime or violation to
 
02:35:01.550 --> 02:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
peacefully Assemble
 
02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
so that Clause notwithstanding any other
 
02:35:06.290 --> 02:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
provision of law
 
02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
says that municipalities can still enact
 
02:35:12.410 --> 02:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
laws your concern is you represent these
 
02:35:14.450 --> 02:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities is that they would this
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
would infringe upon their ability to
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
enact laws that govern times and places
 
02:35:21.250 --> 02:35:21.260 align:start position:0%
of protests
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other provision of
 
02:35:25.849 --> 02:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
law says that these Municipal
 
02:35:28.910 --> 02:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities can still enact such laws
 
02:35:31.130 --> 02:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
so how
 
02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
is this bill then
 
02:35:36.110 --> 02:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
and additionally
 
02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
have determined that the law the the
 
02:35:45.170 --> 02:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
ordinance that was put into place they
 
02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
were all found not guilty so there's
 
02:35:49.309 --> 02:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
clearly a problem with that law
 
02:35:53.270 --> 02:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
so how would this then infringe upon a
 
02:35:55.330 --> 02:35:55.340 align:start position:0%
municipality's ability to
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
regulate times and places of
 
02:36:00.650 --> 02:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
assembly so as I mentioned I'm not
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with the cases oh irrespective
 
02:36:05.210 --> 02:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
of that how would this if because it
 
02:36:06.710 --> 02:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
says notwithstanding any other provision
 
02:36:09.530 --> 02:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
of laws so that's what might also create
 
02:36:11.929 --> 02:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
some additional confusion because there
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
is uh for instance RSA 3139 which allows
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities to put in place Municipal
 
02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:20.970 align:start position:0%
ordinances on very specific things
 
02:36:20.970 --> 02:36:21.530 align:start position:0%
ordinances on very specific things
[Music]

02:36:21.530 --> 02:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:36:21.540 --> 02:36:22.130 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:36:22.130 --> 02:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:22.140 --> 02:36:23.690 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:36:23.690 --> 02:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:25.969 --> 02:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
you know if they're and that would be
 
02:36:28.130 --> 02:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
enacted at town meeting since the town
 
02:36:30.650 --> 02:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
can do it generally proposed by the
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
select board and it's possible there
 
02:36:36.530 --> 02:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
would be some sort of overlap there
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
where there's some sort of authority
 
02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
granted by that law for municipalities
 
02:36:42.590 --> 02:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
to put in ordinances that may
 
02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:43.969 align:start position:0%
to put in ordinances that may
run

02:36:43.969 --> 02:36:43.979 align:start position:0%
run
 
02:36:47.870 --> 02:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
differently from how this law reads and
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
I am slightly confused with a lack of
 
02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
definitions for the term peaceful for
 
02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:55.610 align:start position:0%
definitions for the term peaceful for
instance

02:36:55.610 --> 02:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
instance
 
02:36:58.190 --> 02:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
um as well as line six and seven that
 
02:36:58.200 --> 02:36:59.990 align:start position:0%
um as well as line six and seven that
say

02:36:59.990 --> 02:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
um orderly manner means not engaging in
 
02:37:05.389 --> 02:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
conduct prohibited under paragraph
 
02:37:09.889 --> 02:37:09.899 align:start position:0%
2C or or 3 what exactly that encompasses
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's a follow-up Mr chair yes so where
 
02:37:17.330 --> 02:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
in law is peaceful defined and if
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
there's a reference for this section
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
orderly manner refers to other portions
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the law I'm assuming that refers back
 
02:37:29.210 --> 02:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
to disorderly conduct I don't know the
 
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
law specifically in this case but it's
 
02:37:32.270 --> 02:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
at least referring to something that's
 
02:37:35.210 --> 02:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
been codified how is then peaceful
 
02:37:37.490 --> 02:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
defined so that any judge would then
 
02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:38.570 align:start position:0%
defined so that any judge would then
know

02:37:38.570 --> 02:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
this is how this is the standard for
 
02:37:43.010 --> 02:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
peaceful I'm not aware of any statutory
 
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
definition of the term peaceful but
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're asking them to define it
 
02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:48.230 align:start position:0%
you're asking them to define it
there

02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not the one proposing the law sir
 
02:37:51.889 --> 02:37:51.899 align:start position:0%
but you just said you don't know what
 
02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
peaceful is
 
02:37:56.210 --> 02:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
well I'm that's why I'm pointing that
 
02:37:58.010 --> 02:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
out because it's not defined in the bill
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
in front of you so I I don't exactly
 
02:38:02.570 --> 02:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
know how that would be
 
02:38:05.090 --> 02:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
understood by the courts it appears
 
02:38:07.969 --> 02:38:07.979 align:start position:0%
don't they understand it let's not let's
 
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
not turn this into a debate that I think
 
02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry questions are okay no I'm I'm
 
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
directing it to both both to both
 
02:38:16.250 --> 02:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
parties here
 
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
all right other questions
 
02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
so I guess I do have one question I'm
 
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
let's assume that
 
02:38:27.770 --> 02:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
you're correct that the
 
02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
the con the New Hampshire Constitution
 
02:38:31.849 --> 02:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
02:38:31.859 --> 02:38:34.130 align:start position:0%
would allow
municipalities

02:38:34.130 --> 02:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:38:36.770 --> 02:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
to regulate the time you know at the
 
02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
time place and manner of of protests in
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
a way
 
02:38:45.650 --> 02:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
would not be allowed under this statute
 
02:38:51.230 --> 02:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
I guess my question though so so this
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
statute then would provide more
 
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
protection than the Constitution
 
02:38:58.429 --> 02:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
provides and I and I guess my question
 
02:39:01.010 --> 02:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
is let's assume that all that's true
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
that that this a municipality could
 
02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit could now prohibit some types
 
02:39:11.090 --> 02:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
of protests or demonstrations whatever
 
02:39:13.370 --> 02:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
that they would not be able to provide
 
02:39:15.889 --> 02:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
if this statute was enacted
 
02:39:19.309 --> 02:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question though is so what
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
I mean why why isn't this statute still
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
a good idea if it's limited as it's
 
02:39:27.770 --> 02:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
worded to say it to being peaceful
 
02:39:30.349 --> 02:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
protest well we do advocate for
 
02:39:31.969 --> 02:39:31.979 align:start position:0%
municipalities to maintain their
 
02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
existing Authority and we believe that
 
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
given the volume of case Law related to
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
what municipalities May and may not do
 
02:39:43.610 --> 02:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
in this area that currently exists that
 
02:39:46.370 --> 02:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
that was an appropriate decision by our
 
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
02:39:50.270 --> 02:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
um over the course of many decades
 
02:39:54.170 --> 02:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
refining that as well as the U.S Supreme
 
02:39:56.570 --> 02:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
Court and
 
02:39:58.670 --> 02:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's our position as we think that's
 
02:40:01.610 --> 02:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
the appropriate appropriate answer is
 
02:40:03.770 --> 02:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
the courts have decided and their
 
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
decision was correct okay no that's fine
 
02:40:07.730 --> 02:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh question yes representative Perez
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
I apologize we have a lot of people who
 
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
are very knowledgeable on the law I was
 
02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
a nurse for 42 years so
 
02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:17.150 align:start position:0%
a nurse for 42 years so
um

02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
are you saying that towns
 
02:40:24.290 --> 02:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
can override the New Hampshire
 
02:40:27.770 --> 02:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
Constitution so if okay so if the New
 
02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution allows for
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:38.210 --> 02:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
if a town says yeah but you can only do
 
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
it this this and this
 
02:40:43.070 --> 02:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
the town's allowed to do that
 
02:40:44.809 --> 02:40:44.819 align:start position:0%
so maybe it's easier if I give you an
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
example sure
 
02:40:48.530 --> 02:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
if you the town level were to say hey
 
02:40:52.429 --> 02:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
something's a good idea
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't know you're gonna
 
02:40:55.790 --> 02:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
ban let's say you're going to ban
 
02:40:57.410 --> 02:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
nuclear weapons from your town right
 
02:40:59.690 --> 02:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
some Town actually did this
 
02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
you could you could pass a town
 
02:41:03.290 --> 02:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
ordinance that does that now whether
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
that prevents the US government from
 
02:41:07.309 --> 02:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
setting up a missile silo in your town
 
02:41:10.130 --> 02:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
with a nuclear weapon in it is totally
 
02:41:14.450 --> 02:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:16.849 --> 02:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
um law because towns are subdivisions of
 
02:41:18.770 --> 02:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
the state and they can't override state
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
laws they can't override the federal
 
02:41:23.389 --> 02:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
laws that would be applied through the
 
02:41:25.309 --> 02:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause and they certainly
 
02:41:26.809 --> 02:41:26.819 align:start position:0%
can't override either the New Hampshire
 
02:41:29.270 --> 02:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
or the U.S constitutions
 
02:41:32.929 --> 02:41:32.939 align:start position:0%
so in understanding what the
 
02:41:36.670 --> 02:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
U.S and New Hampshire constitutions mean
 
02:41:39.770 --> 02:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
they the attorneys assisting the towns
 
02:41:42.530 --> 02:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
have to rely on
 
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
Court decisions Supreme Court decisions
 
02:41:48.530 --> 02:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
mainly to understand that the words used
 
02:41:50.570 --> 02:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
in those because they have very specific
 
02:41:52.370 --> 02:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
meanings which
 
02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
have developed have been clarified
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
um over centuries at this point
 
02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
it may be possible for a town to do
 
02:42:05.210 --> 02:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
something which is unconstitutional and
 
02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying nuclear weapons is is a
 
02:42:10.429 --> 02:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
is a great example for this but they
 
02:42:13.250 --> 02:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
could do something like that and that
 
02:42:14.809 --> 02:42:14.819 align:start position:0%
would violate
 
02:42:17.389 --> 02:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh some sort of state or federal law
 
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
someone with standing meaning they have
 
02:42:22.130 --> 02:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
the ability to challenge that law could
 
02:42:25.370 --> 02:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
come in sue and say hey this this can't
 
02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
you can't enforce this this isn't a this
 
02:42:30.349 --> 02:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
isn't a lawful ordinance and then the
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
court would look at that and they would
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
make a determination about whether it
 
02:42:37.490 --> 02:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
was law or not and based on
 
02:42:39.530 --> 02:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
both the existing state and federal
 
02:42:41.450 --> 02:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
statutes as well as the appropriate
 
02:42:43.969 --> 02:42:43.979 align:start position:0%
constitutions and if it if the court
 
02:42:46.370 --> 02:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
found that it was not
 
02:42:48.290 --> 02:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
um lawful and
 
02:42:50.510 --> 02:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
some in this case constitutional uh
 
02:42:53.090 --> 02:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
would be the question then that
 
02:42:54.889 --> 02:42:54.899 align:start position:0%
ordinance would not would not be allowed
 
02:42:56.690 --> 02:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
to be enforced it may still technically
 
02:42:59.929 --> 02:42:59.939 align:start position:0%
be on the books but it's not enforceable
 
02:43:01.130 --> 02:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
um and there there would be a clear
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
judicial decision on that I hope that's
 
02:43:06.349 --> 02:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
helpful yes thank you uh representative
 
02:43:08.210 --> 02:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
Wallace thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
02:43:10.670 --> 02:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question isn't any uh Laura
 
02:43:12.050 --> 02:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
statute that's repugnant to the
 
02:43:13.730 --> 02:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
Constitution Ellen void pursuant to
 
02:43:16.730 --> 02:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.809 --> 02:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:24.650 --> 02:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:26.450 --> 02:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I'm not unique in this but I've
 
02:43:29.090 --> 02:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
had a couple occasions where people have
 
02:43:31.070 --> 02:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
been threatening or leash harassing me
 
02:43:32.330 --> 02:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
because they take exception with
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
something I said to Truth for their
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
special attention because I was a State
 
02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
Rep but do
 
02:43:40.849 --> 02:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
what power do municipalities have to uh
 
02:43:43.309 --> 02:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
just protect anybody who's a target of
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
a target of harassment or threatening um
 
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're a public
 
02:43:50.929 --> 02:43:50.939 align:start position:0%
officials so they have any
 
02:43:53.630 --> 02:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
because I know when I by these incidents
 
02:43:55.490 --> 02:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
I did contact the police department they
 
02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
just said they well while they well we
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
agreed to is that you know they keep an
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
extra eye on my house and send the
 
02:44:02.210 --> 02:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
patrol cars more and if anybody was
 
02:44:03.889 --> 02:44:03.899 align:start position:0%
presumably if anybody's loiting around
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
they would try to stop them from
 
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
loitering so is that something into
 
02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities actually have uh you know
 
02:44:12.770 --> 02:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
authority authority to do under some
 
02:44:15.290 --> 02:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
laws and are we talking about this bill
 
02:44:18.770 --> 02:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
I mean yes yes oh well yes I am yeah I
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
mean right I mean that
 
02:44:22.490 --> 02:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
I mean that is part of it is that like
 
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh Governor it's a new new had
 
02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
displeased a number of people in the
 
02:44:29.570 --> 02:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
community and they were uh expressing
 
02:44:30.889 --> 02:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
their displeasure in that particular
 
02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
spot which apparently is allegedly
 
02:44:36.349 --> 02:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
public property and probably was but to
 
02:44:36.359 --> 02:44:37.190 align:start position:0%
public property and probably was but to
see

02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
does even disability of any specific
 
02:44:40.429 --> 02:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
02:44:42.889 --> 02:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
sort of like prevent people from uh
 
02:44:45.770 --> 02:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
congregating or loitering or harassing
 
02:44:47.570 --> 02:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
somebody who for whatever reason has
 
02:44:51.469 --> 02:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
attracted the ire of of a group of group
 
02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
of individuals I'm not sure if this
 
02:44:55.969 --> 02:44:55.979 align:start position:0%
makes any sense
 
02:44:55.979 --> 02:44:58.790 align:start position:0%
makes any sense
so

02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:00.349 --> 02:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think about how to frame
 
02:45:02.270 --> 02:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
this yeah so
 
02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:03.770 align:start position:0%
this yeah so
um

02:45:03.770 --> 02:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
the government can't control
 
02:45:09.650 --> 02:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
what you say except in very very
 
02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
specific manner so for instance you
 
02:45:12.770 --> 02:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
can't go in a crowded theater and shout
 
02:45:15.050 --> 02:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
fire when there's no fire because that's
 
02:45:17.929 --> 02:45:17.939 align:start position:0%
that that creates a hazard
 
02:45:19.490 --> 02:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:45:22.130 --> 02:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
they can regulate the time place and
 
02:45:24.650 --> 02:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
manner for a public gathering so for
 
02:45:24.660 --> 02:45:26.450 align:start position:0%
manner for a public gathering so for
example

02:45:26.450 --> 02:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:45:29.630 --> 02:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
the government could prevent people from
 
02:45:31.849 --> 02:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
you know closing down Main Street or the
 
02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
highway to have a protest because that's
 
02:45:37.730 --> 02:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
going to be dangerous they're you know
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
because people are not going to know
 
02:45:40.969 --> 02:45:40.979 align:start position:0%
driver's not going to know if somebody's
 
02:45:42.530 --> 02:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
going to hit by a car that's not a good
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
02:45:45.469 --> 02:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
um so generally speaking that's pretty
 
02:45:47.809 --> 02:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
widely accepted and understood
 
02:45:50.210 --> 02:45:50.220 align:start position:0%
when you get into specific facts as
 
02:45:52.870 --> 02:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
appear to be the motivation behind this
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh this particular legislation
 
02:45:59.450 --> 02:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
um that's going to depend on the exact
 
02:46:01.969 --> 02:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
facts and Circumstance of the case as
 
02:46:04.370 --> 02:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
they relate to the law it exists now and
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
the best
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
entity to decide what that how that
 
02:46:14.090 --> 02:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
applies is the judicial branch they have
 
02:46:16.190 --> 02:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
expertise in that
 
02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:16.849 align:start position:0%
expertise in that
um

02:46:16.849 --> 02:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:19.429 --> 02:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
and they can apply to law and and make
 
02:46:20.809 --> 02:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
those judgments that's what they're
 
02:46:26.090 --> 02:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:36.010 --> 02:46:36.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:38.750 --> 02:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Mr chair members
 
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:40.680 align:start position:0%

02:46:42.830 --> 02:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
testify here today I know we're over
 
02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
time so I'll try to be as brief as
 
02:46:46.969 --> 02:46:46.979 align:start position:0%
possible for the record my name is Chris
 
02:46:48.770 --> 02:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
madement I am here in my personal

capacity today as a resident of
 
02:46:52.730 --> 02:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
Peterborough and a citizen of New
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh in December of 2020 I was
 
02:46:59.090 --> 02:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
employed as a reporter for New Hampshire
 
02:47:02.809 --> 02:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
Journal uh in online news source here in
 
02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
we had broken the story of the ordinance
 
02:47:09.650 --> 02:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
in new fields that had passed the select
 
02:47:12.650 --> 02:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
board there uh after three readings
 
02:47:16.130 --> 02:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
um and following us breaking that story
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
The the night in question that several
 
02:47:20.570 --> 02:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
other speakers mentioned
 
02:47:22.969 --> 02:47:22.979 align:start position:0%
um that Candlelight vigil was organized
 
02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
and we had spoken with the the state
 
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
police and the newfields police ahead of
 
02:47:30.889 --> 02:47:30.899 align:start position:0%
time and they had promised uh aggressive
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement of this new ordinance which
 
02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
turned out to be absolutely true
 
02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:36.950 align:start position:0%
turned out to be absolutely true
um

02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:38.929 --> 02:47:38.939 align:start position:0%
I was cited
 
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
that evening as as well as the the
 
02:47:43.610 --> 02:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
protesters were
 
02:47:45.530 --> 02:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
um with the violation of that town
 
02:47:45.540 --> 02:47:46.670 align:start position:0%
um with the violation of that town
ordinance

02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
02:47:48.290 --> 02:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
um and I have the the text of that
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
ordinance I know somebody asked about
 
02:47:52.010 --> 02:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
that the ordinance read it is unlawful
 
02:47:54.889 --> 02:47:54.899 align:start position:0%
for any person to engage in picketing
 
02:47:57.290 --> 02:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
before or about the residence or
 
02:47:59.570 --> 02:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
dwelling of any individual in the town
 
02:48:02.090 --> 02:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
of new Fields uh simple one one-line
 
02:48:04.550 --> 02:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
statement uh the Attorney General's
 
02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
office helped newfields draft this
 
02:48:08.929 --> 02:48:08.939 align:start position:0%
ordinance they determined that it would
 
02:48:11.870 --> 02:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
be constitutional uh the courts clearly
 
02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
agreed with that
 
02:48:16.370 --> 02:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
um as there was an as applied challenge
 
02:48:18.770 --> 02:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
as the the previous speaker was
 
02:48:18.780 --> 02:48:20.270 align:start position:0%
as the the previous speaker was
wondering

02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
02:48:22.250 --> 02:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
um the courts basically ignored the as
 
02:48:24.830 --> 02:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
applied challenge in this case at least
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
in my case
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh so they did not render a decision on
 
02:48:30.590 --> 02:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
whether it was uh constitutional as
 
02:48:32.330 --> 02:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
applied or not
 
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
um but but clearly the motion to dismiss
 
02:48:37.250 --> 02:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
was was uh
 
02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
denied in all of the cases and all cases
 
02:48:42.770 --> 02:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
did proceed to trial except mine after
 
02:48:46.309 --> 02:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
18 months my case was Noel Prost uh in
 
02:48:50.090 --> 02:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
May of 2021 uh 2022 rather
 
02:48:50.100 --> 02:48:51.290 align:start position:0%
May of 2021 uh 2022 rather
um

02:48:51.290 --> 02:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:51.300 --> 02:48:52.690 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:48:52.690 --> 02:48:52.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:55.849 --> 02:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
whereas the courts have found that this
 
02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
is a constitutional ordinance this
 
02:49:01.309 --> 02:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
statute is would be necessary in order
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
to prevent these prevent towns or cities
 
02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
from passing similar ordinances that
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
criminalize Granite Staters right to to
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
protest now it keep in mind in uh
 
02:49:18.530 --> 02:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
2020 we were in the midst of covid the
 
02:49:20.690 --> 02:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
State House was largely closed to the
 
02:49:20.700 --> 02:49:22.150 align:start position:0%
State House was largely closed to the
public

02:49:22.150 --> 02:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:49:24.050 --> 02:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
Representatives that were serving at the
 
02:49:25.969 --> 02:49:25.979 align:start position:0%
time were serving from from home mostly
 
02:49:28.750 --> 02:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
the lob was largely closed to the public
 
02:49:32.030 --> 02:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
so the government normally where where
 
02:49:34.010 --> 02:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
people would go to redress their
 
02:49:37.250 --> 02:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
grievances or to protest certain certain
 
02:49:38.570 --> 02:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
happenings by the government those
 
02:49:40.450 --> 02:49:40.460 align:start position:0%
buildings were closed
 
02:49:44.270 --> 02:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm not condoning protesting in
 
02:49:46.490 --> 02:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
front of somebody's home but when I
 
02:49:48.290 --> 02:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
spoke to the protesters at the time as
 
02:49:50.510 --> 02:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
as a reporter they had indicated that
 
02:49:53.410 --> 02:49:53.420 align:start position:0%
they had no other place to protest
 
02:49:56.929 --> 02:49:56.939 align:start position:0%
except for the home where the where the
 
02:49:59.270 --> 02:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
the governor was working from he wasn't
 
02:50:00.650 --> 02:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
working from the state house at the time
 
02:50:02.889 --> 02:50:02.899 align:start position:0%
and that their position was that
 
02:50:05.389 --> 02:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
they were trying to protest his actions
 
02:50:07.010 --> 02:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
he wasn't in the state house so they
 
02:50:09.530 --> 02:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
couldn't protest at the state house so
 
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
they brought the protest to his quiet
 
02:50:14.570 --> 02:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood uh in another
 
02:50:17.090 --> 02:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
question that I heard
 
02:50:19.809 --> 02:50:19.819 align:start position:0%
a couple times is what defines peaceful
 
02:50:22.670 --> 02:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
I would posit that the the right
 
02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
question is what defines uh disorderly
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
I think if we were to try to Define
 
02:50:30.170 --> 02:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
peaceful it would be a very long list of
 
02:50:32.809 --> 02:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
what constitutes peaceful activity but
 
02:50:37.130 --> 02:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
chapter 644 2 which is where this
 
02:50:39.550 --> 02:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
statute would be placed if it passes
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
defines disorderly conduct all of those
 
02:50:44.570 --> 02:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
statues would still be in place the
 
02:50:46.330 --> 02:50:46.340 align:start position:0%
police would still be able to enforce
 
02:50:49.389 --> 02:50:49.399 align:start position:0%
those statutes they would be able to
 
02:50:52.190 --> 02:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
arrest or remove people that were acting
 
02:50:55.070 --> 02:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
disorderly specifically this bill
 
02:50:58.969 --> 02:50:58.979 align:start position:0%
mentions paragraph 2C which uh
 
02:51:01.309 --> 02:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
refers to obstructing vehicular or
 
02:51:03.290 --> 02:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
pedestrian traffic on any public Street
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
or sidewalk or the entrance to any
 
02:51:07.250 --> 02:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
public building and it also references
 
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph three which talks about
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
breaches of the piece loud and
 
02:51:15.410 --> 02:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
unreasonable noises annoyances threats
 
02:51:18.889 --> 02:51:18.899 align:start position:0%
or disrupting the lawful assembly or
 
02:51:20.830 --> 02:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
meeting of persons with lawful Authority
 
02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
so if somebody were to come in here and
 
02:51:25.610 --> 02:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
make loud noises and disrupt the
 
02:51:27.590 --> 02:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
business of this committee that is
 
02:51:31.250 --> 02:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
defined in chapter 6442 as disorderly
 
02:51:33.830 --> 02:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
conduct and that would also apply to
 
02:51:35.889 --> 02:51:35.899 align:start position:0%
Executive Council meetings for example
 
02:51:39.469 --> 02:51:39.479 align:start position:0%
or any other government meeting select
 
02:51:43.570 --> 02:51:43.580 align:start position:0%
board what have you so this really only
 
02:51:47.690 --> 02:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh prevents towns from criminalizing the
 
02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
peaceful and lawful assembly of people
 
02:51:52.429 --> 02:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
uh as defined in in the United States
 
02:51:55.010 --> 02:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
Constitution First Amendment and as well
 
02:51:57.710 --> 02:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
as the New Hampshire Constitution uh and
 
02:51:59.809 --> 02:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
whereas the courts have agreed that the
 
02:52:01.309 --> 02:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
organ is passed by new Fields is
 
02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh this statute would be
 
02:52:06.889 --> 02:52:06.899 align:start position:0%
necessary if the legislature saw fit to
 
02:52:09.290 --> 02:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
prevent more ordinances like that or to
 
02:52:11.870 --> 02:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
nullify the new Fields ordinance
 
02:52:13.849 --> 02:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
um I like I said I know we're over so
 
02:52:15.830 --> 02:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap it up there but I'd be happy
 
02:52:18.889 --> 02:52:18.899 align:start position:0%
to take any questions for this Witness
 
02:52:21.050 --> 02:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative Turner
 
02:52:23.150 --> 02:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
yeah um hopefully this question is
 
02:52:24.410 --> 02:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate for you it probably could
 
02:52:26.330 --> 02:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
have been directed at anyone I guess
 
02:52:28.130 --> 02:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
what I'm struggling with is
 
02:52:31.250 --> 02:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
um does this really hinge on the
 
02:52:33.290 --> 02:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not the court
 
02:52:36.349 --> 02:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
case challenging this
 
02:52:39.410 --> 02:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
um was rightly or wrongly decided by the
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
courts and essentially if I'm getting it
 
02:52:43.010 --> 02:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
right it could have worked its way up
 
02:52:44.750 --> 02:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
through the system but it was sort of
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
nullified by the fact that everyone was
 
02:52:48.889 --> 02:52:48.899 align:start position:0%
was acquitted in other words that versus
 
02:52:51.889 --> 02:52:51.899 align:start position:0%
needing a new law versus the the
 
02:52:54.710 --> 02:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
application of the the constitute excuse
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
me the Constitutional provision uh thank
 
02:52:58.849 --> 02:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question
 
02:52:58.859 --> 02:53:00.290 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question
um

02:53:00.290 --> 02:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:03.950 --> 02:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
so because uh all the defendants were
 
02:53:05.929 --> 02:53:05.939 align:start position:0%
found not guilty uh my case was Noel
 
02:53:09.050 --> 02:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
Prost but that did stop the appeals
 
02:53:10.490 --> 02:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
process you can't appeal a not guilty
 
02:53:12.290 --> 02:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
verdict I mean you could but that would
 
02:53:13.730 --> 02:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
be kind of weird right
 
02:53:16.370 --> 02:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
um so it did not it's not able to go up
 
02:53:18.910 --> 02:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
to the state supreme court to to
 
02:53:20.389 --> 02:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
definitively decide the
 
02:53:20.399 --> 02:53:22.130 align:start position:0%
definitively decide the
constitutionality

02:53:22.130 --> 02:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
constitutionality
 
02:53:24.769 --> 02:53:24.779 align:start position:0%
um but the courts the district court in
 
02:53:26.769 --> 02:53:26.779 align:start position:0%
this case did
 
02:53:30.590 --> 02:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh deny the motion to dismiss which had
 
02:53:33.950 --> 02:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
the as applied uh challenge in it
 
02:53:35.929 --> 02:53:35.939 align:start position:0%
um and they ignored that provision so
 
02:53:38.510 --> 02:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't necessarily say that this
 
02:53:40.429 --> 02:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
was constitutional but their the
 
02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
interpretation of their order uh could
 
02:53:44.450 --> 02:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
be construed that they had decided that
 
02:53:47.210 --> 02:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
this was constitutional even as applied
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
um so this law would just clarify uh for
 
02:53:54.170 --> 02:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
for any future cases any possible future
 
02:53:57.349 --> 02:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
cases that towns do not have the right
 
02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
to criminalize uh peaceful and lawful
 
02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
assembly yeah it's one quick follow-up
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
sure so what would be your thought about
 
02:54:07.730 --> 02:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
you you talked about if if something
 
02:54:09.950 --> 02:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
like this were to come up again you know
 
02:54:12.650 --> 02:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
would would this uh situation be
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
essentially processed by a case that did
 
02:54:17.750 --> 02:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
make its way up the system and was
 
02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately decided versus passing a new
 
02:54:22.670 --> 02:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
law uh thank you for the question I I I
 
02:54:25.610 --> 02:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
am not a lawyer so I can't speak
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
definitively to what you're saying
 
02:54:31.610 --> 02:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure perhaps chairman Lin could
 
02:54:33.950 --> 02:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
answer that for you um as a former
 
02:54:36.290 --> 02:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Justice and I I I'd defer
 
02:54:39.410 --> 02:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
to him on that matter you know can can I
 
02:54:42.710 --> 02:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
ask can I ask this question what um did
 
02:54:44.030 --> 02:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:54:48.050 --> 02:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
in either in the in in the Court's
 
02:54:51.889 --> 02:54:51.899 align:start position:0%
opinion in that case or in the or if you
 
02:54:56.269 --> 02:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
know in this in the prosecutions you
 
02:54:58.929 --> 02:54:58.939 align:start position:0%
know brief or memorandum to the court
 
02:55:03.170 --> 02:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
was there any reference made to
 
02:55:05.929 --> 02:55:05.939 align:start position:0%
in the decision to the fact that there
 
02:55:08.889 --> 02:55:08.899 align:start position:0%
was uh you know that this that that
 
02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
covid played a role in the Court's
 
02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
decision the fact that there was uh I
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
mean was there anything for example like
 
02:55:18.050 --> 02:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
saying you know people people who are
 
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
protesting peacefully in front of the
 
02:55:22.190 --> 02:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
governor's house at a time of covert
 
02:55:23.450 --> 02:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
they're going to be too close to each
 
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
other there might be some health issues
 
02:55:27.769 --> 02:55:27.779 align:start position:0%
was there anything in the Court's
 
02:55:27.779 --> 02:55:28.790 align:start position:0%
was there anything in the Court's
decision

02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%

02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
definitively I don't recall off the top
 
02:55:40.130 --> 02:55:40.140 align:start position:0%

02:55:43.130 --> 02:55:43.140 align:start position:0%

um now I'm going to call on Jason gearh
 
02:56:26.990 --> 02:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:28.969 --> 02:56:28.979 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you welcome thank you
 
02:56:31.010 --> 02:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
committee I
 
02:56:33.469 --> 02:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
was actually one of the participants in
 
02:56:35.389 --> 02:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
well that was there that night that the
 
02:56:36.830 --> 02:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
tickets were issued so eight people were
 
02:56:38.990 --> 02:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
issued tickets one was arrested
 
02:56:42.530 --> 02:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
and the importance of this legislation
 
02:56:46.610 --> 02:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:49.010 --> 02:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
we have to stick to the Constitution we
 
02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
have to make it very clear that no
 
02:56:53.570 --> 02:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
matter what office you possess in this
 
02:56:56.389 --> 02:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
government state country
 
02:56:59.210 --> 02:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
people can still Express themselves and
 
02:57:00.889 --> 02:57:00.899 align:start position:0%
their concerns to you
 
02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
because let's go back in time to when
 
02:57:05.150 --> 02:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
this all was going down the governor
 
02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
cancels the inauguration
 
02:57:08.870 --> 02:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I believe it was that night actually
 
02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
the candlelight vigil was planned
 
02:57:13.490 --> 02:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
the vigil was for the victims of the
 
02:57:15.170 --> 02:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
lockdown so people that were suffering
 
02:57:18.349 --> 02:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
from drug overdoses suicides this really
 
02:57:20.090 --> 02:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
messed a lot of people up people already
 
02:57:21.950 --> 02:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
on the edge the whole covet thing kind
 
02:57:23.570 --> 02:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
of pushed them off now we could argue
 
02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
that it was necessary and all that and I
 
02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
think events have proven that to be not
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
true but point being I all know we were
 
02:57:30.950 --> 02:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
away over time so I just want to make
 
02:57:32.030 --> 02:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
this quick and if anybody has questions
 
02:57:35.030 --> 02:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
about the actual night's events but the
 
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
just the heavy-handed nature of the
 
02:57:38.809 --> 02:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
whole situation was just insane I mean
 
02:57:40.130 --> 02:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
you had to be there there's some videos
 
02:57:42.290 --> 02:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
and Frank's a little bit out there but
 
02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
he means well
 
02:57:46.429 --> 02:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
um we it was just
 
02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
it was surreal I mean we're just there
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're walking down that
 
02:57:51.950 --> 02:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
the walkway that does abut his property
 
02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
but it was all it's on public property
 
02:57:54.710 --> 02:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's a right-of-way to this country
 
02:57:58.490 --> 02:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
store down the street and next thing you
 
02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
know all these state troopers show up
 
02:58:01.730 --> 02:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
with the riot gear on it felt like
 
02:58:03.889 --> 02:58:03.899 align:start position:0%
Hunger Games you don't have the shields
 
02:58:06.830 --> 02:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
the I mean it was so unnecessary and I
 
02:58:08.690 --> 02:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
understand it's to make a point to send
 
02:58:11.450 --> 02:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
a message and all that but where are we
 
02:58:12.889 --> 02:58:12.899 align:start position:0%
going to go from here if you can't
 
02:58:15.050 --> 02:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
protest and it was not it was a
 
02:58:16.490 --> 02:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
candlelight vigil there was no signs
 
02:58:17.510 --> 02:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
there was nothing because we didn't want
 
02:58:18.830 --> 02:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
the picketing issue
 
02:58:20.690 --> 02:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
it was really for the victims of the
 
02:58:23.570 --> 02:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
lockdown so if any questions I don't
 
02:58:25.010 --> 02:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
want to Ramble On and On I know you got
 
02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
to be on time but quick questions for
 
02:58:30.110 --> 02:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
02:58:32.269 --> 02:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
can I do can I just ask right well I
 
02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
know I have one question do you know
 
02:58:37.670 --> 02:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
have has there been any effort within
 
02:58:39.889 --> 02:58:39.899 align:start position:0%
the town of new fields to repeal the
 
02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
ordinance no I think doing so would then
 
02:58:44.210 --> 02:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
put them at liability of lawsuits well
 
02:58:45.889 --> 02:58:45.899 align:start position:0%
there's already on lawsuits but if they
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
say that okay this is bad this is a bad
 
02:58:49.670 --> 02:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
idea now it's okay now you're admitting
 
02:58:52.250 --> 02:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
such it's all right are there any other
 
02:58:54.230 --> 02:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much sir thank
 
02:58:56.510 --> 02:58:56.520 align:start position:0%

I'm here to introduce HB 169 on behalf
 
03:00:00.349 --> 03:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
of a constituent Linda Morgan who will
 
03:00:02.389 --> 03:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
be testifying in Greater detail than
 
03:00:06.170 --> 03:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
myself after I'm uh completed here this
 
03:00:08.269 --> 03:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
comes about where
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
a one-year-old child
 
03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:11.450 align:start position:0%
a one-year-old child
um

03:00:11.450 --> 03:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:13.370 --> 03:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
03:00:15.410 --> 03:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
was given over to the grandparents at
 
03:00:16.990 --> 03:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
the age of approximately one year old
 
03:00:19.849 --> 03:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
due to habitual drug use on behalf of
 
03:00:22.610 --> 03:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
both parents uh the child was subject to
 
03:00:26.210 --> 03:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
mental trauma physical trauma uh this
 
03:00:28.730 --> 03:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
child has autism
 
03:00:31.429 --> 03:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
um the grandparent Linda Morgan received
 
03:00:33.050 --> 03:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
custody of this child for a period of
 
03:00:34.429 --> 03:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
almost six years
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh the parents then
 
03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
supposedly were clean and wanted to
 
03:00:42.769 --> 03:00:42.779 align:start position:0%
return custody of that child back to
 
03:00:46.010 --> 03:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
themselves there was a long drawn-out
 
03:00:49.309 --> 03:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
Court battle and unfortunately Linda
 
03:00:51.290 --> 03:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
Morgan lost custody after raising this
 
03:00:52.610 --> 03:00:52.620 align:start position:0%
child for a period I should say
 
03:00:54.530 --> 03:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
guardianship I'm sorry after a period of
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
six years that's all this child knew
 
03:01:00.170 --> 03:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
um even in the court hearing which I
 
03:01:02.570 --> 03:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
think Linda's going to testify to
 
03:01:02.580 --> 03:01:03.410 align:start position:0%
think Linda's going to testify to
um

03:01:03.410 --> 03:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:05.150 --> 03:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
the level was preponderance of the
 
03:01:06.830 --> 03:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
evidence which I'm not a lawyer but in
 
03:01:08.990 --> 03:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
simple terms that's a 51 chance that it
 
03:01:11.330 --> 03:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
was better to go back to the parents in
 
03:01:13.070 --> 03:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
a situation like this I believe there
 
03:01:15.290 --> 03:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
needs to be a higher standard this bill
 
03:01:16.730 --> 03:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
changes at the clear and convincing
 
03:01:19.370 --> 03:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
evidence that may not be the solution I
 
03:01:20.450 --> 03:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
believe there probably needs to be
 
03:01:21.889 --> 03:01:21.899 align:start position:0%
amendments so this doesn't happen again
 
03:01:21.899 --> 03:01:24.110 align:start position:0%
amendments so this doesn't happen again
but

03:01:24.110 --> 03:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:01:26.450 --> 03:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
the mental health and well-being of the
 
03:01:28.429 --> 03:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
child needs to be taken into account the
 
03:01:30.250 --> 03:01:30.260 align:start position:0%
situation that that child is living in
 
03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
some may say this bill is an affront to
 
03:01:35.510 --> 03:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
parental rights I believe it has to be a
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
balance between yes parental rights I'm
 
03:01:39.710 --> 03:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
100 behind that but also the mental
 
03:01:40.910 --> 03:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of that child
 
03:01:43.370 --> 03:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
going forward especially at such a young
 
03:01:45.590 --> 03:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
age where all that child knew growing up
 
03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
for six years was the grandparent as
 
03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:49.969 align:start position:0%
for six years was the grandparent as
mama

03:01:49.969 --> 03:01:49.979 align:start position:0%
mama
 
03:01:51.830 --> 03:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and now she was basically ripped from
 
03:01:54.290 --> 03:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
her arms and given back to the parish so
 
03:01:56.809 --> 03:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
this is a long long process it's com
 
03:01:59.929 --> 03:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
it's complicated hopefully the great
 
03:02:01.309 --> 03:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
minds in this committee can come up with
 
03:02:03.650 --> 03:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
a solution to help alleviate this
 
03:02:06.230 --> 03:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
problem for people like Linda Morgan and
 
03:02:08.710 --> 03:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
many other people that unfortunately
 
03:02:11.269 --> 03:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't come testify tonight today
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
because they fear retaliation from
 
03:02:16.070 --> 03:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
family members if they supported a bill
 
03:02:18.110 --> 03:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
like this so I will take any questions
 
03:02:20.210 --> 03:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
but I believe Linda Morgan will provide
 
03:02:22.010 --> 03:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
a lot more detail she had provided a
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
written letter that she submitted to
 
03:02:26.750 --> 03:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
governor sununu who does support the
 
03:02:28.910 --> 03:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
idea of changing this or reminising this
 
03:02:31.969 --> 03:02:31.979 align:start position:0%
problem that that this current law as it
 
03:02:31.979 --> 03:02:33.710 align:start position:0%
problem that that this current law as it
sits

03:02:33.710 --> 03:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
sits
 
03:02:33.720 --> 03:02:34.790 align:start position:0%
sits
um

03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:36.290 --> 03:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
03:02:38.210 --> 03:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
there needs to be something done here
 
03:02:40.429 --> 03:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
put it simply
 
03:02:42.349 --> 03:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
questions for this work yes
 
03:02:43.849 --> 03:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
representative Grace
 
03:02:44.990 --> 03:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:02:48.469 --> 03:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative in the in subparagraph C
 
03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh sub paragraph B should not apply if
 
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
guardianship of the person was granted
 
03:02:54.950 --> 03:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
to a grandparent as a result of the
 
03:02:58.070 --> 03:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
parents substance abuse or dependence
 
03:03:01.550 --> 03:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
and yet in order to provide for
 
03:03:04.130 --> 03:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
essential physical safety needs of the
 
03:03:06.889 --> 03:03:06.899 align:start position:0%
minor of sub paragraph B would you not
 
03:03:09.769 --> 03:03:09.779 align:start position:0%
also need to modify this to include any
 
03:03:11.210 --> 03:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
form of abuse
 
03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
not just substance abuse or depends
 
03:03:15.170 --> 03:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why this child is not
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the custody of the parents but is in
 
03:03:19.490 --> 03:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
the custody of some Guardian
 
03:03:22.730 --> 03:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
in this case either not a grandparent or
 
03:03:24.849 --> 03:03:24.859 align:start position:0%
other relative or a grandparent
 
03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
so would we not need to amend this to
 
03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
cover any other forms of abuse or is
 
03:03:30.889 --> 03:03:30.899 align:start position:0%
that covered somewhere else in statute
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
I again I'm not a lawyer and I I
 
03:03:34.670 --> 03:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't find anything particularly
 
03:03:36.349 --> 03:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
being covered somewhere else but I think
 
03:03:38.690 --> 03:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
again that's a great idea to make this
 
03:03:41.809 --> 03:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
uh Bill stronger to take into account
 
03:03:43.550 --> 03:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
the well-being of the child in a much
 
03:03:46.010 --> 03:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
broader fashion rather than narrowly
 
03:03:46.020 --> 03:03:49.610 align:start position:0%
broader fashion rather than narrowly
focused

03:03:49.610 --> 03:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:50.990 --> 03:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
03:03:54.050 --> 03:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
Turner yeah so uh building on what
 
03:03:55.790 --> 03:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative greeson said it also
 
03:03:58.190 --> 03:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
seems like limiting it to
 
03:04:00.590 --> 03:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
um guardianship of a grandparent versus
 
03:04:02.510 --> 03:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:04:06.290 --> 03:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
Guardian relative or not I'm not sure
 
03:04:08.389 --> 03:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
why that the provision of a grandparent
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
stands out
 
03:04:12.110 --> 03:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I can't answer
 
03:04:14.690 --> 03:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
that why this was an existing this was
 
03:04:17.830 --> 03:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
this was passed I believe back in 2017
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
and this is a modification of that like
 
03:04:23.570 --> 03:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
from that time why it's subject to just
 
03:04:25.309 --> 03:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
grandparents in here
 
03:04:27.050 --> 03:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
again I'm not a lawyer unfortunately
 
03:04:29.450 --> 03:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
this is above my pay grade
 
03:04:29.460 --> 03:04:31.010 align:start position:0%
this is above my pay grade
so

03:04:31.010 --> 03:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:04:33.170 --> 03:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'd be honest with you
 
03:04:37.730 --> 03:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:41.450 --> 03:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
as um as a labor and delivery nurse I
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
have seen
 
03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
um over the years many
 
03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:45.730 align:start position:0%
um over the years many
um

03:04:45.730 --> 03:04:45.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:48.650 --> 03:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
addicted children and often the
 
03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
grandparents are the ones who end up
 
03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes taking guardianship of that
 
03:04:57.050 --> 03:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
child because the parents either have
 
03:04:59.570 --> 03:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
left the child unattended after the
 
03:04:59.580 --> 03:05:01.030 align:start position:0%
left the child unattended after the
delivery

03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
03:05:06.410 --> 03:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
and gone back to Muse again or or they
 
03:05:09.010 --> 03:05:09.020 align:start position:0%
just cannot physically
 
03:05:11.690 --> 03:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
and mentally be able to care for that
 
03:05:16.429 --> 03:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
child so um it often has been I've seen
 
03:05:19.730 --> 03:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
where that the grandparents are the ones
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:25.550 --> 03:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
03:05:25.560 --> 03:05:27.349 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
balance

03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
balance
 
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:34.080 --> 03:05:35.210 align:start position:0%
 
to

03:05:35.210 --> 03:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:05:35.220 --> 03:05:35.889 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:05:35.889 --> 03:05:35.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:38.269 --> 03:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence
 
03:05:41.630 --> 03:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
but there's a different standard in
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph 5A which would still be
 
03:05:46.910 --> 03:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
um well you want to change it to clear
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
and convincing but paragraph 5A would
 
03:05:52.610 --> 03:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
still be preponderance of the evidence
 
03:05:52.620 --> 03:05:53.450 align:start position:0%
still be preponderance of the evidence
um

03:05:53.450 --> 03:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:55.370 --> 03:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering about having two
 
03:05:57.950 --> 03:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
different standards within the same
 
03:05:57.960 --> 03:05:59.150 align:start position:0%
different standards within the same
statute

03:05:59.150 --> 03:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:06:02.929 --> 03:06:02.939 align:start position:0%
sure so under B uh preponderance of the
 
03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
evidence that's for the guardian has to
 
03:06:06.530 --> 03:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
demonstrate by a preponderance of the
 
03:06:07.670 --> 03:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
evidence that substitution or
 
03:06:08.929 --> 03:06:08.939 align:start position:0%
supplementation parental care and
 
03:06:10.250 --> 03:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
supervision is necessary to provide
 
03:06:12.110 --> 03:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
essential physical safety needs of the
 
03:06:12.120 --> 03:06:13.010 align:start position:0%
essential physical safety needs of the
minor

03:06:13.010 --> 03:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
minor
 
03:06:15.950 --> 03:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the case where
 
03:06:18.410 --> 03:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
my understanding of it is it's that's a
 
03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
51 chance preponderance of the evidence
 
03:06:22.429 --> 03:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
if I put it in layman terms that the
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
guardian has to prove that it's
 
03:06:30.050 --> 03:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
worthwhile that substitution is is
 
03:06:32.090 --> 03:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh worth going back to the guardian
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
where I think in our case so when we
 
03:06:37.010 --> 03:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
when I sent this bill to OLS they
 
03:06:39.410 --> 03:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
changed both parts of it I was primarily
 
03:06:41.710 --> 03:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
focused on C due to the drug use part
 
03:06:44.450 --> 03:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
which changed it from preponderance of
 
03:06:46.370 --> 03:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
the evidence which was 51 chance to
 
03:06:47.870 --> 03:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence which was
 
03:06:50.330 --> 03:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
a higher bar again Layman turns is at a
 
03:06:52.130 --> 03:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
70 chance I know Reasonable Doubt is
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
Criminal that's overwhelming clear 99 I
 
03:06:55.920 --> 03:06:56.750 align:start position:0%
Criminal that's overwhelming clear 99 I
guess

03:06:56.750 --> 03:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
guess
 
03:06:59.330 --> 03:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
so I think again through the amendment
 
03:07:02.210 --> 03:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
process maybe B isn't necessary but I
 
03:07:04.429 --> 03:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
definitely believe C is where the
 
03:07:07.130 --> 03:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
corrections need to happen at least at
 
03:07:11.090 --> 03:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much sir thank
 
03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:18.349 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much sir thank
you

03:07:18.349 --> 03:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:07:21.650 --> 03:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh next I'm going to call on Jonathan
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
Smith oh that was me oh I'm sorry
 
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:42.830 --> 03:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:07:44.450 --> 03:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to be here
 
03:07:44.460 --> 03:07:46.849 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to be here
today

03:07:46.849 --> 03:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
this is my granddaughter Maya
 
03:07:52.250 --> 03:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
she is with me in some form Wherever I
 
03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:57.469 align:start position:0%
she is with me in some form Wherever I
Go

03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:00.050 --> 03:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
let me first start by reiterating what
 
03:08:02.269 --> 03:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
um representative Smith had stated um
 
03:08:05.030 --> 03:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
that there are many many people that I
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
know of myself in my community in my
 
03:08:09.530 --> 03:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
realm of friends
 
03:08:11.450 --> 03:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
um and people who have reached out to me
 
03:08:13.490 --> 03:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
that I've reached out to
 
03:08:16.429 --> 03:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
um that are in this situation
 
03:08:16.439 --> 03:08:18.290 align:start position:0%
um that are in this situation
and

03:08:18.290 --> 03:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
they are afraid to speak out to stand up
 
03:08:22.080 --> 03:08:22.849 align:start position:0%
they are afraid to speak out to stand up
um

03:08:22.849 --> 03:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:22.859 --> 03:08:24.469 align:start position:0%
um
because

03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:08:27.050 --> 03:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
they will risk most likely the
 
03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
relationship that they have with that
 
03:08:28.380 --> 03:08:29.630 align:start position:0%
relationship that they have with that
child

03:08:29.630 --> 03:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:08:32.690 --> 03:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
um that they have today and that that
 
03:08:34.429 --> 03:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't
 
03:08:36.530 --> 03:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a thing
 
03:08:39.290 --> 03:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
I will share with you um as quickly as I
 
03:08:41.690 --> 03:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
can I know time is an issue beginning
 
03:08:43.370 --> 03:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
with the letter that I wrote to Governor
 
03:08:47.809 --> 03:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
sununu back on October 10 2020.
 
03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
I'm writing you today to ask that you
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
consider making changes to the
 
03:08:53.210 --> 03:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
guardianship guidelines in our state
 
03:08:55.550 --> 03:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
though each case is unique in its
 
03:08:57.530 --> 03:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
standing the guidelines are overall
 
03:08:59.929 --> 03:08:59.939 align:start position:0%
as I cannot speak for each case in the
 
03:09:02.630 --> 03:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
state and each case has its own story I
 
03:09:05.389 --> 03:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
can speak for mine
 
03:09:07.010 --> 03:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
I've had my granddaughter in my home
 
03:09:09.170 --> 03:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
under my care for then five years now
 
03:09:09.180 --> 03:09:10.670 align:start position:0%
under my care for then five years now
seven

03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
seven
 
03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
she is
 
03:09:15.050 --> 03:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
six years old now eight
 
03:09:17.269 --> 03:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
and she is autistic
 
03:09:19.370 --> 03:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
I have had permanent guardianship for
 
03:09:20.929 --> 03:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
then three and a half years
 
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
a total of five and a half to almost six
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
years I am the only caregiver she has
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
known and I have provided for her
 
03:09:29.330 --> 03:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
academic spiritual physical social
 
03:09:31.550 --> 03:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
Financial emotional and mental health
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
needs with no help from either family or
 
03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:36.230 align:start position:0%
needs with no help from either family or
parent

03:09:36.230 --> 03:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
parent
 
03:09:38.210 --> 03:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
both parents are addicts in recovery
 
03:09:40.849 --> 03:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
after several attempts by both they may
 
03:09:42.889 --> 03:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
or may not be successful
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
as you know there is always the
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
possibility of relapse and Recovery is a
 
03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
lifelong battle
 
03:09:50.090 --> 03:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
both parents still have their parental
 
03:09:52.730 --> 03:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
rights as it stands either parent could
 
03:09:53.990 --> 03:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
ask the court to reverse the
 
03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:55.309 align:start position:0%
ask the court to reverse the
guardianship

03:09:55.309 --> 03:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
guardianship
 
03:09:57.170 --> 03:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
if this were to happen my granddaughter
 
03:10:01.010 --> 03:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:04.010 --> 03:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
that she has known
 
03:10:06.050 --> 03:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
away from the only caregiver that she's
 
03:10:06.060 --> 03:10:07.130 align:start position:0%
away from the only caregiver that she's
had

03:10:07.130 --> 03:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
away from her community that has
 
03:10:10.429 --> 03:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
established that she has established
 
03:10:13.309 --> 03:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
roots in and that has enveloped her with
 
03:10:16.670 --> 03:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
the environment of both support and love
 
03:10:19.010 --> 03:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
away from her daily routines that keep
 
03:10:21.230 --> 03:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
her growing successfully away from her
 
03:10:22.910 --> 03:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
church family and church that she
 
03:10:24.230 --> 03:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
strives in
 
03:10:27.290 --> 03:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
away from her school and support network
 
03:10:29.750 --> 03:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
and service providers away from our
 
03:10:32.450 --> 03:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
friends away from her family
 
03:10:34.250 --> 03:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
and away from everything that she has
 
03:10:36.230 --> 03:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
learned to trust and love over the past
 
03:10:37.730 --> 03:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
and be placed into a very different
 
03:10:39.359 --> 03:10:40.490 align:start position:0%
and be placed into a very different
community

03:10:40.490 --> 03:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:10:42.410 --> 03:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
with people that she's not familiar with
 
03:10:44.809 --> 03:10:44.819 align:start position:0%
and who are strangers to her in a
 
03:10:46.429 --> 03:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
different home with a different
 
03:10:49.250 --> 03:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
caregiver different routines Etc
 
03:10:50.809 --> 03:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that this is the best
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
choice that could be made for her
 
03:10:52.080 --> 03:10:53.990 align:start position:0%
choice that could be made for her
well-being

03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
and after now seven years of nurturing
 
03:10:58.910 --> 03:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
providing for love and support seeing to
 
03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
services and providers encouraging her
 
03:11:03.410 --> 03:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
success each day in seeing that she has
 
03:11:05.570 --> 03:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
all that she needs to continue to grow
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
in a six into a successful young girl
 
03:11:10.790 --> 03:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
despite her autism that that be taken
 
03:11:13.250 --> 03:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
away from her it would be so unfair to
 
03:11:15.230 --> 03:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
her in such a disadvantage after she has
 
03:11:17.450 --> 03:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
come so far overcoming the effects of
 
03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
Early Childhood trauma neglect and abuse
 
03:11:21.889 --> 03:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
that she suffered in her first year and
 
03:11:23.929 --> 03:11:23.939 align:start position:0%
a half of life
 
03:11:26.090 --> 03:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
I am asking you to consider some kind of
 
03:11:28.610 --> 03:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
guidelines that if a child is in a safe
 
03:11:30.830 --> 03:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
healthy environment under guardianship
 
03:11:32.750 --> 03:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
especially in permanent guardianship
 
03:11:35.330 --> 03:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
cases for a period of time whether
 
03:11:38.690 --> 03:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
that's 12 18 24 months whatever that may
 
03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
look like that if the guardian is
 
03:11:42.349 --> 03:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
willing to keep the guardianship
 
03:11:44.389 --> 03:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
established permanently that that child
 
03:11:46.969 --> 03:11:46.979 align:start position:0%
will not risk leaving a stable loving
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
nurturing environment that they can
 
03:11:51.170 --> 03:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
thrive in and not be bounced into other
 
03:11:53.450 --> 03:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
environments or situations that could
 
03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
potentially cause them physical or
 
03:11:57.170 --> 03:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
mental harm
 
03:11:59.210 --> 03:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
the state is aware that the pandemic
 
03:12:01.070 --> 03:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
that we are in at this time has caused
 
03:12:03.230 --> 03:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
much Social and emotional turmoil for
 
03:12:05.150 --> 03:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
our children not being able to
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
consistently be at school in a safe
 
03:12:09.290 --> 03:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
environment throughout the day away from
 
03:12:10.610 --> 03:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
their family routines and services
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
without their daily education and some
 
03:12:15.950 --> 03:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
in harmful situations as there has been
 
03:12:17.929 --> 03:12:17.939 align:start position:0%
support added to our school systems on
 
03:12:19.849 --> 03:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
the return of the students into their
 
03:12:22.429 --> 03:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
schools as we open this fall
 
03:12:24.590 --> 03:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
imagine a child who cannot begin to
 
03:12:26.809 --> 03:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
comprehend the situation and having to
 
03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
change their environment altogether
 
03:12:31.070 --> 03:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's a tremendously scary thing for
 
03:12:33.050 --> 03:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
those individuals and I believe that we
 
03:12:34.429 --> 03:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
are adding to the adverse childhood
 
03:12:37.130 --> 03:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
Effects by doing so as well as the
 
03:12:39.349 --> 03:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
strain on our mental health that it
 
03:12:42.110 --> 03:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
causes and doing a disservice to those
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
young individuals
 
03:12:46.610 --> 03:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
I feel that overall though our goal and
 
03:12:48.349 --> 03:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
hope is to eliminate the strain put on
 
03:12:49.849 --> 03:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
our children in New Hampshire in any
 
03:12:52.010 --> 03:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
case that by continuing with the process
 
03:12:54.290 --> 03:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
as it is we'll only continue to build
 
03:12:54.300 --> 03:12:55.730 align:start position:0%
as it is we'll only continue to build
Ace

03:12:55.730 --> 03:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
Ace
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
mental health issues and drug abuse in
 
03:12:59.150 --> 03:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
the future
 
03:13:01.309 --> 03:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
which is an ever-growing Circle that
 
03:13:03.469 --> 03:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
needs to be broken
 
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
our children are being told in some
 
03:13:07.490 --> 03:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
cases that no matter what it is that
 
03:13:09.469 --> 03:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
they would like in life no matter what
 
03:13:11.809 --> 03:13:11.819 align:start position:0%
they believe is most comfortable in some
 
03:13:14.090 --> 03:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
cases even safe for them that that
 
03:13:16.370 --> 03:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
actually does not matter overall because
 
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
they are at risk of being removed from a
 
03:13:21.410 --> 03:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
safe loving nurturing environment and
 
03:13:23.090 --> 03:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
being placed into something that may not
 
03:13:24.830 --> 03:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
be what is best suited for their
 
03:13:27.170 --> 03:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
individual needs and well-being
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
and in doing so we are actually creating
 
03:13:31.610 --> 03:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
a horrific Circle which will continue to
 
03:13:33.170 --> 03:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
put a strain on our mental health system
 
03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
and create future turmoil and continue
 
03:13:37.550 --> 03:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
the conflict of addiction from today's
 
03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:39.110 align:start position:0%
the conflict of addiction from today's
children

03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
they are not given the choice process in
 
03:13:43.010 --> 03:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
their daily lives so how can they
 
03:13:44.929 --> 03:13:44.939 align:start position:0%
determine good choices
 
03:13:46.790 --> 03:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
or if they voice what is most
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable or fulfilling for them that
 
03:13:51.349 --> 03:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
their voice does not matter
 
03:13:53.750 --> 03:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the poor choices today
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
can lead to unlawfulness in our youth
 
03:13:59.630 --> 03:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
as well as addiction
 
03:14:01.610 --> 03:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
also in looking at the Americans
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
Disability Act a lot has happened over
 
03:14:06.950 --> 03:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
the years in our state Alone by 2010 it
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
was clear that we had a serious drug
 
03:14:11.690 --> 03:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire by 2015 it
 
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
moved from a crisis situation and was
 
03:14:15.530 --> 03:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
declared an epidemic
 
03:14:17.690 --> 03:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
now we have a pandemic that we're faced
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
with yet past revisions in the Ada do
 
03:14:23.330 --> 03:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
not seem accurate for what we and our
 
03:14:25.790 --> 03:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
children have been faced with by this I
 
03:14:27.290 --> 03:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
feel clearly that we are letting our
 
03:14:29.389 --> 03:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
disabled citizens of New Hampshire down
 
03:14:32.269 --> 03:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
the Ada is a complete umbrella but even
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
an umbrella holds multiple secure tips
 
03:14:37.070 --> 03:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
to secure its own to support its own
 
03:14:37.080 --> 03:14:38.510 align:start position:0%
to secure its own to support its own
canopy

03:14:38.510 --> 03:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
canopy
 
03:14:40.190 --> 03:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
I believe it's time for a change in
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
these areas and I believe it's now we
 
03:14:44.750 --> 03:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
deserve better for our state and its
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
people and I know that you care for each
 
03:14:48.650 --> 03:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
and every one of us I'm asking you today
 
03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
to please consider changes for the
 
03:14:51.769 --> 03:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
well-being of our children of New
 
03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and to help provide for the
 
03:14:55.610 --> 03:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
better future that each and every one of
 
03:14:56.809 --> 03:14:56.819 align:start position:0%
them deserves
 
03:15:00.349 --> 03:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
I have spoken to Governor sununu's
 
03:15:02.090 --> 03:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
office I spoke to a few different people
 
03:15:05.150 --> 03:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
down there several times one stands out
 
03:15:07.130 --> 03:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
to mind his name was Preston
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
and um he said that this is something
 
03:15:11.570 --> 03:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
that the governor would support
 
03:15:15.530 --> 03:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
um something that um he looks for to um
 
03:15:18.889 --> 03:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
to help our our state be stronger and to
 
03:15:20.990 --> 03:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
help our children so I'm in hopes of
 
03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:22.309 align:start position:0%
help our children so I'm in hopes of
that

03:15:22.309 --> 03:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:15:26.809 --> 03:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
since I wrote that letter back in 2020
 
03:15:26.819 --> 03:15:28.309 align:start position:0%
since I wrote that letter back in 2020
um

03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:31.550 --> 03:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
on August 29 2022
 
03:15:34.429 --> 03:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
my granddaughter was forced to leave the
 
03:15:36.710 --> 03:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
security and stability of her home that
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
she was raised in
 
03:15:39.650 --> 03:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
she's been forced to leave a community
 
03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
that um that supported her she's left
 
03:15:44.510 --> 03:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
her church her school her friends the
 
03:15:47.330 --> 03:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
close proximity of family she's two
 
03:15:49.250 --> 03:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
hours away it's not easy
 
03:15:52.570 --> 03:15:52.580 align:start position:0%
and this has greatly affected her
 
03:15:55.730 --> 03:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
psychologically it has greatly affected
 
03:15:55.740 --> 03:15:57.410 align:start position:0%
psychologically it has greatly affected
her

03:15:57.410 --> 03:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
her
 
03:16:00.730 --> 03:16:00.740 align:start position:0%
Maya suffers from PTSD as well as autism
 
03:16:03.650 --> 03:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
due to the neglect and abuse an early
 
03:16:05.210 --> 03:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
childhood Trauma from the environment
 
03:16:06.830 --> 03:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
that she was forced to live in day in
 
03:16:08.090 --> 03:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
and day out
 
03:16:10.309 --> 03:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
she like so many others was born into
 
03:16:12.110 --> 03:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
this you said yourself
 
03:16:15.290 --> 03:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
um these children you know it's it's it
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
happens every day they're born into this
 
03:16:19.610 --> 03:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
situation and
 
03:16:22.969 --> 03:16:22.979 align:start position:0%
they they don't know better
 
03:16:24.710 --> 03:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
um they don't know what it's like um
 
03:16:27.410 --> 03:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
they deserve that and if someone can
 
03:16:29.750 --> 03:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
03:16:32.030 --> 03:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's a wonderful thing
 
03:16:34.010 --> 03:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
we're adding to the trauma
 
03:16:36.349 --> 03:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
and as we uproot them from a safe and
 
03:16:38.809 --> 03:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
stable thriving environment
 
03:16:42.889 --> 03:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
this as I said is my granddaughter Maya
 
03:16:46.670 --> 03:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
this is her school picture from 2021 in
 
03:16:46.680 --> 03:16:47.929 align:start position:0%
this is her school picture from 2021 in
September

03:16:47.929 --> 03:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
September
 
03:16:49.730 --> 03:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
at the bottom you'll see there's a
 
03:16:52.670 --> 03:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
banner and it says
 
03:16:55.130 --> 03:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
let your smile change the world but
 
03:16:58.429 --> 03:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
don't let the world change your smile
 
03:17:00.349 --> 03:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
she has this on other of her photos as
 
03:17:00.359 --> 03:17:01.670 align:start position:0%
she has this on other of her photos as
well

03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:17:04.730 --> 03:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
but Maya is not smiling this year
 
03:17:11.450 --> 03:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:13.309 --> 03:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
you see it's hard to smile
 
03:17:15.410 --> 03:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
when some when the world around you has
 
03:17:17.090 --> 03:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
made a decision that will drastically
 
03:17:20.090 --> 03:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:21.710 --> 03:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
03:17:23.269 --> 03:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know when I'm going to see this
 
03:17:25.490 --> 03:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
little girl again
 
03:17:28.190 --> 03:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
the last time I saw her was Christmas
 
03:17:28.200 --> 03:17:31.130 align:start position:0%
the last time I saw her was Christmas
evening

03:17:31.130 --> 03:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
as in the darkness I watched her cross
 
03:17:36.769 --> 03:17:36.779 align:start position:0%
the street up in Littleton
 
03:17:39.290 --> 03:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
in her pajamas and her boots
 
03:17:42.050 --> 03:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
she clutched a new toy under her arm
 
03:17:43.370 --> 03:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
because she made her way up the
 
03:17:44.990 --> 03:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
crosswalk she realized that I was
 
03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
standing there she didn't even know she
 
03:17:47.929 --> 03:17:47.939 align:start position:0%
was going to see me and when she
 
03:17:50.090 --> 03:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
recognized me she stopped
 
03:17:52.490 --> 03:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
and she called my name
 
03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
and I said yes sweetie it's me
 
03:17:58.130 --> 03:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
she ran as fast as she could to jump in
 
03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
my arms and she just told me she loved
 
03:18:04.190 --> 03:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
me so much how much she missed me
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
and how she hasn't seen me in Forever
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
I was so thankful for that night that I
 
03:18:11.389 --> 03:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
was able to see her
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
but as I said I don't know
 
03:18:17.690 --> 03:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
but I'm gonna be able to see her again
 
03:18:19.790 --> 03:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
I told her when it was time to pack her
 
03:18:23.450 --> 03:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
up the next day and send her back home
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
that I wasn't sure when I would see her
 
03:18:30.110 --> 03:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
again but I hoped it would be soon
 
03:18:32.990 --> 03:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I had to help her understand
 
03:18:35.929 --> 03:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
and she doesn't clearly but I did
 
03:18:40.070 --> 03:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
reassure her that I would see her one
 
03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:40.849 align:start position:0%
reassure her that I would see her one
day

03:18:40.849 --> 03:18:40.859 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
and until then
 
03:18:45.349 --> 03:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
she will be in my heart
 
03:18:49.010 --> 03:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:51.050 --> 03:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
she gave me a kiss and told me she loved
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
me and she hoped it was soon
 
03:18:57.230 --> 03:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:59.570 --> 03:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
Maya and the children of this state
 
03:19:02.030 --> 03:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
deserve to receive the security that
 
03:19:04.190 --> 03:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
they can continue to thrive in an
 
03:19:06.650 --> 03:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
environment full of love support and
 
03:19:08.929 --> 03:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
compassion to be nurtured and to
 
03:19:11.090 --> 03:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
continue to be successful without
 
03:19:14.750 --> 03:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
interruption and I hope today is the day
 
03:19:17.570 --> 03:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
that we can start making a difference in
 
03:19:19.309 --> 03:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
the lives of the children
 
03:19:21.650 --> 03:19:21.660 align:start position:0%

03:19:34.800 --> 03:19:37.010 align:start position:0%

wow
 
03:19:40.370 --> 03:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with terms like
 
03:19:42.530 --> 03:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence or
 
03:19:45.290 --> 03:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence
 
03:19:48.650 --> 03:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
what was the evidence that was provided
 
03:19:52.490 --> 03:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
to a judge that enabled your
 
03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
granddaughter to be then taken from you
 
03:19:56.990 --> 03:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the stable environment and placed
 
03:19:59.809 --> 03:19:59.819 align:start position:0%
with one or both parents
 
03:20:02.990 --> 03:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
that you what what was that evidence
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
that allowed that to facilitate that
 
03:20:04.560 --> 03:20:05.630 align:start position:0%
that allowed that to facilitate that
decision

03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
it was a long it was a long drawn out a
 
03:20:11.690 --> 03:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
few years of of going back and forth but
 
03:20:13.130 --> 03:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
um pretty much
 
03:20:15.769 --> 03:20:15.779 align:start position:0%
he needed a place of residence
 
03:20:18.650 --> 03:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
which is an address
 
03:20:21.650 --> 03:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
um and some source of income
 
03:20:24.230 --> 03:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:20:27.050 --> 03:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
he is told the court that he hasn't
 
03:20:28.610 --> 03:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
worked for a few years he's been
 
03:20:28.620 --> 03:20:29.990 align:start position:0%
worked for a few years he's been
unemployed

03:20:29.990 --> 03:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
unemployed
 
03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:32.690 align:start position:0%
unemployed
so

03:20:32.690 --> 03:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:35.210 --> 03:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't understand it they
 
03:20:37.490 --> 03:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
don't understand it
 
03:20:39.050 --> 03:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
and that's basically what he needed
 
03:20:43.130 --> 03:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:46.190 --> 03:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
I had someone approach me at church two
 
03:20:49.610 --> 03:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
weeks ago in this type of situation
 
03:20:53.210 --> 03:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
um must have been looking through
 
03:20:55.490 --> 03:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
different articles this particular
 
03:20:55.500 --> 03:20:56.690 align:start position:0%
different articles this particular
person

03:20:56.690 --> 03:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:20:56.700 --> 03:20:57.830 align:start position:0%
person
um

03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:01.250 --> 03:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
took a year a grandfather to get their
 
03:21:06.290 --> 03:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
grandson out of dcyf okay and
 
03:21:09.230 --> 03:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
um he said the only way he was able to
 
03:21:12.170 --> 03:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
get around this fear of having the child
 
03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
taken away from him was he took another
 
03:21:18.889 --> 03:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
seven months and adopted this child did
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
you ever consider trying to adopt her I
 
03:21:23.150 --> 03:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
don't know the process I certainly did
 
03:21:25.969 --> 03:21:25.979 align:start position:0%
it's not an easy process I don't um you
 
03:21:28.849 --> 03:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
know I would have had to somehow
 
03:21:28.859 --> 03:21:29.870 align:start position:0%
know I would have had to somehow
um

03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:32.929 --> 03:21:32.939 align:start position:0%
terminate both parents rights
 
03:21:34.849 --> 03:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
I don't have the right to do that
 
03:21:37.010 --> 03:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
they were in rehab so it's not about
 
03:21:38.570 --> 03:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
abandonment they were In and Out Of
 
03:21:41.570 --> 03:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
Reach several rehabs over several years
 
03:21:44.210 --> 03:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
it's not abandonment even though they're
 
03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
not providing for they're not caring for
 
03:21:48.349 --> 03:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
they're not contacting
 
03:21:48.359 --> 03:21:49.730 align:start position:0%
they're not contacting
yes

03:21:49.730 --> 03:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
that explains the difference
 
03:21:56.330 --> 03:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
um his son was was in jail so okay um I
 
03:21:59.210 --> 03:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
applaud you I'm a grandparent
 
03:22:01.550 --> 03:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
I applaud you thank you other questions
 
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:07.190 --> 03:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
I I guess I just have I I just have a
 
03:22:09.530 --> 03:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
couple so am I understanding I just want
 
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm sure that I am
 
03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:14.330 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm sure that I am
your

03:22:14.330 --> 03:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:22:17.450 --> 03:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
the way that the guardianship that
 
03:22:18.889 --> 03:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
you're telling us about was terminated
 
03:22:18.899 --> 03:22:19.849 align:start position:0%
you're telling us about was terminated
was

03:22:19.849 --> 03:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:22:22.370 --> 03:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
there was a proceeding by one or both of
 
03:22:23.929 --> 03:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
03:22:27.889 --> 03:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
to have custody of of your granddaughter
 
03:22:31.250 --> 03:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
return to them and you had a
 
03:22:34.010 --> 03:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
Court proceeding in which they were
 
03:22:36.830 --> 03:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
successful yes we had a lengthy two-day
 
03:22:39.889 --> 03:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
proceeding but three years of back and
 
03:22:42.590 --> 03:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
forth right and and and I I take it you
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
think that the court made the wrong
 
03:22:46.910 --> 03:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
decision in that case I do and and did
 
03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
was there an appeal taken to the Supreme
 
03:22:51.530 --> 03:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
Court about that I can't appeal it
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
you can't I've been told I cannot appeal
 
03:22:56.630 --> 03:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
it there is nothing to appeal because of
 
03:22:58.910 --> 03:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
the language in our system okay all
 
03:23:00.889 --> 03:23:00.899 align:start position:0%

tell us who you are please hi I'm Brian
 
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
Clark in the interest of time I'd like
 
03:23:23.389 --> 03:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
to have Beth margason with dcyf speak
 
03:23:27.410 --> 03:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:30.110 --> 03:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh chair Lynn and
 
03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee we appreciate
 
03:23:33.950 --> 03:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
the time to be heard this afternoon and
 
03:23:35.510 --> 03:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
we'll be brief
 
03:23:38.330 --> 03:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
um we don't take a position on this on
 
03:23:40.429 --> 03:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
this uh piece of legislation as it does
 
03:23:43.550 --> 03:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
not really uh pertain to dcyf however
 
03:23:45.469 --> 03:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
there is one section that would affect
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
dcyf If This Were to go through the be
 
03:23:53.510 --> 03:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
the change to B to a preponderance of
 
03:23:56.090 --> 03:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
the evidence dcyf would need to have a
 
03:23:57.110 --> 03:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
carve out
 
03:23:59.330 --> 03:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
for that section to keep it at clear and
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence because we do
 
03:24:04.969 --> 03:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
guardianships as permanency plans that
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
are done with the consent of the parent
 
03:24:08.210 --> 03:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
under the adoption and safe family act
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
and that is actually referenced in your
 
03:24:13.130 --> 03:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
in this in this
 
03:24:16.929 --> 03:24:16.939 align:start position:0%
um statute as a number
 
03:24:21.170 --> 03:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
463 colon 5 3D
 
03:24:23.570 --> 03:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
whether guardianship is being sought by
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
the department as part of the permanent
 
03:24:27.110 --> 03:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
plan for a child in the Department's
 
03:24:29.389 --> 03:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
custody because pursuant to the adoption
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
and say families act and so if this were
 
03:24:35.450 --> 03:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
changed to a preponderance of the
 
03:24:37.990 --> 03:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that would not make our
 
03:24:40.130 --> 03:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
permanency plans when we do have
 
03:24:42.889 --> 03:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
guardianship which we Ms Morgan is no
 
03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
longer here unfortunately but sometimes
 
03:24:46.670 --> 03:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
we do have guardianships that are our
 
03:24:49.130 --> 03:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
permanency plan and in order for them to
 
03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
really remain permanent we would need
 
03:24:53.269 --> 03:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
that higher evidentiary standard of
 
03:24:55.670 --> 03:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence
 
03:24:57.469 --> 03:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
um so that would be the Department's
 
03:24:59.630 --> 03:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
concerns about this and asking for a
 
03:25:01.370 --> 03:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
carve out on it
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I did note just looking at this
 
03:25:05.090 --> 03:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
occasionally dcyf does have to use the
 
03:25:07.010 --> 03:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
guardianship statute
 
03:25:08.750 --> 03:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
03:25:11.330 --> 03:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
the standards for establishing
 
03:25:14.570 --> 03:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
a guardianship If This Were to change
 
03:25:17.210 --> 03:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
the standards for terminating it there
 
03:25:19.370 --> 03:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
would be some incongruence there so that
 
03:25:22.610 --> 03:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
may be something for the uh depart the
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee to look at but um those are
 
03:25:26.809 --> 03:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
our comments on this bill the first
 
03:25:29.510 --> 03:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
comments are just particular to dcif and
 
03:25:31.010 --> 03:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
the need for a carve out and just a
 
03:25:32.750 --> 03:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
general comment just looking at it as
 
03:25:34.490 --> 03:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
somebody who does deal with the statute
 
03:25:35.630 --> 03:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
from time to time the different
 
03:25:37.610 --> 03:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
standards for establishing and
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
terminating a guardianship would change
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to go through all
 
03:25:45.410 --> 03:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh questions for this
 
03:25:45.420 --> 03:25:47.809 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh questions for this
Witness

03:25:47.809 --> 03:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:50.510 --> 03:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
so I I see none I guess I do have great
 
03:25:53.210 --> 03:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure when you say
 
03:25:56.150 --> 03:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
are you saying that
 
03:25:59.870 --> 03:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
when you talk about a dcyf carve out are
 
03:26:02.929 --> 03:26:02.939 align:start position:0%
you saying that you that legally there
 
03:26:04.849 --> 03:26:04.859 align:start position:0%
would be one that would be required are
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
you just saying that it would
 
03:26:11.330 --> 03:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
that dcyf would not like to have the
 
03:26:13.130 --> 03:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
standard lowered because it might make
 
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
it it might make
 
03:26:18.290 --> 03:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
permanently planning more difficult yes
 
03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
standard makes it more difficult to to
 
03:26:33.590 --> 03:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
um to upset them to upset them okay so
 
03:26:35.630 --> 03:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
that's whether or not that's required by
 
03:26:37.130 --> 03:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
the adoption and say families act which
 
03:26:40.250 --> 03:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
is a federal law I do not know okay all
 
03:26:40.260 --> 03:26:41.269 align:start position:0%
is a federal law I do not know okay all
right

03:26:41.269 --> 03:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:26:44.210 --> 03:26:44.220 align:start position:0%

04:16:55.969 --> 04:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn members of the House
 
04:16:58.010 --> 04:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee thank you for the
 
04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce HBU 187 this is
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
the short one sentence bill and I will
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
try to keep my testimony equally short
 
04:17:08.929 --> 04:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
uh currently uh only the sheriff has the
 
04:17:10.670 --> 04:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
power and authority to serve criminal or
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
civil process and enforce civil orders
 
04:17:15.650 --> 04:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
from any Court the fee structure for the
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
service is based on mileage the farther
 
04:17:20.689 --> 04:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
away the sheriff office is from where
 
04:17:23.150 --> 04:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
processes serve the higher the fees
 
04:17:24.889 --> 04:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
in areas of New Hampshire where the
 
04:17:27.950 --> 04:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
county office Sheriff's Office is
 
04:17:30.290 --> 04:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
centrally located this works out okay
 
04:17:32.570 --> 04:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
in more rural areas such as the town of
 
04:17:32.580 --> 04:17:33.650 align:start position:0%
in more rural areas such as the town of
Grafton

04:17:33.650 --> 04:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
Grafton
 
04:17:35.330 --> 04:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
um this results in very high fees
 
04:17:39.650 --> 04:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
Grafton County Sheriff lists mileage to
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
Grafton to be 135 miles with total
 
04:17:45.070 --> 04:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
mileage fee of
 
04:17:48.229 --> 04:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
88.43 and about two and a half hours on
 
04:17:50.210 --> 04:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
the road round trip
 
04:17:52.729 --> 04:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
for comparison serving the same process
 
04:17:55.010 --> 04:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
in Haverhill where the sheriff office is
 
04:17:58.130 --> 04:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
located is only 9.83 the difference
 
04:18:00.650 --> 04:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
between 88 dollars and nine dollars when
 
04:18:03.170 --> 04:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
the service being provided is the same
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayer is painful for residents
 
04:18:06.710 --> 04:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
of Grafton
 
04:18:08.330 --> 04:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh there are many ways to solve this
 
04:18:10.130 --> 04:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
problem we can change the fee structure
 
04:18:12.530 --> 04:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
away from mileage but I believe the
 
04:18:14.210 --> 04:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
mileage is actually the most reasonable
 
04:18:16.250 --> 04:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
way to do this since the cost of the
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
service is directly passed down to the
 
04:18:20.389 --> 04:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
customer this leads to Greater
 
04:18:22.910 --> 04:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
transparency and more efficiency
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
we could also move the sheriff to a more
 
04:18:27.050 --> 04:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
central location in the county this is
 
04:18:29.210 --> 04:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
obviously not a practical solution for
 
04:18:31.550 --> 04:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
various reasons including Staffing and
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that the Sheriff's Office
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
performs many other duties which benefit
 
04:18:36.830 --> 04:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
from being close to the county
 
04:18:39.170 --> 04:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
courthouse the prison and other County
 
04:18:39.180 --> 04:18:41.269 align:start position:0%
courthouse the prison and other County
offices

04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
offices
 
04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
the solution is in this bill is to
 
04:18:45.530 --> 04:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
Simply delegate the task of serving
 
04:18:47.870 --> 04:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
process to a department closer to where
 
04:18:49.969 --> 04:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
the work needs to be done thus
 
04:18:51.889 --> 04:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
eliminating the long drive and the high
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
fees local police also have the
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of knowing their town and
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
their people and how to find somebody to
 
04:18:59.570 --> 04:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
serve process who may be trying to avoid
 
04:19:01.849 --> 04:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
being served
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
I have received many objections in
 
04:19:07.490 --> 04:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
talking to my County sheriff and and
 
04:19:09.650 --> 04:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
local police Chiefs so the three main
 
04:19:12.170 --> 04:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
objectives objections are that local
 
04:19:14.510 --> 04:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
police don't have the resources of St or
 
04:19:16.610 --> 04:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
Staffing to serve process
 
04:19:18.590 --> 04:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
my response to this objection is that
 
04:19:20.330 --> 04:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
the bill is purely enabling legislation
 
04:19:22.490 --> 04:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
it does not require the local police to
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
serve process it merely enables them to
 
04:19:26.870 --> 04:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
do so if a police chief does not think
 
04:19:28.729 --> 04:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
serving process is good policy for their
 
04:19:30.530 --> 04:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
Department then they will not be
 
04:19:31.849 --> 04:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
required to do so
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
local the other argument is the local
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
police can't afford to do this my intent
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
with the bill is for local police to be
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
able to use the same or similar fee
 
04:19:42.290 --> 04:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
structure as used by the sheriff in
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
discussing this with my local police
 
04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
chief he says he currently receives
 
04:19:47.450 --> 04:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
payment when someone updates with the
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
sex offender registry therefore
 
04:19:51.110 --> 04:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
accepting fees for service is something
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
police departments already do
 
04:19:56.689 --> 04:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
the third argument is that local police
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
should concentrate on crime I think this
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
is certainly a valid argument and the
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
prerogative of the police chief again
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
this bill does not require police
 
04:20:06.110 --> 04:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
departments to change their process it
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
merely enables them if they choose to do
 
04:20:08.279 --> 04:20:09.889 align:start position:0%
merely enables them if they choose to do
so

04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh Grafton police chief is neutral on
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
this bill but understands the reason for
 
04:20:15.170 --> 04:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
it and says he will take the extra
 
04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
training as necessary to be able to
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
provide the service to Grafton residents
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
you will note that the the language in
 
04:20:24.410 --> 04:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
the bill includes a lot more than simply
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
authorizing service of process the
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
staffer who wrote this bill explained
 
04:20:30.650 --> 04:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
that this particular statute has not
 
04:20:32.990 --> 04:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
been updated in a very long time and the
 
04:20:34.910 --> 04:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
additional language is to make sure the
 
04:20:36.290 --> 04:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
duties police departments are already
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
performing to not inadvertently get
 
04:20:38.040 --> 04:20:40.250 align:start position:0%
performing to not inadvertently get
excluded

04:20:40.250 --> 04:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
finally I have two Amendment requests if
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
you look at the fiscal note on the bill
 
04:20:48.410 --> 04:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
it uh the municipal Association found
 
04:20:49.610 --> 04:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
that the bill has written would not
 
04:20:51.170 --> 04:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
allow the local police department to
 
04:20:53.450 --> 04:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
collect fees I ask that an amendment be
 
04:20:55.130 --> 04:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
made to allow Police Department to
 
04:20:57.410 --> 04:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
collect the necessary fees and also to
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
mirror that fee structure to um there of
 
04:21:03.290 --> 04:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:06.050 --> 04:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
um and it was brought another uh
 
04:21:07.969 --> 04:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be helpful is it
 
04:21:09.410 --> 04:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
was brought to my attention that while
 
04:21:10.849 --> 04:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill has taken
 
04:21:14.210 --> 04:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
almost verbatim from RSA 1046 the
 
04:21:16.070 --> 04:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
statute authorizing Sheriff to serve
 
04:21:18.349 --> 04:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
process and enforce orders there was one
 
04:21:20.090 --> 04:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
part missing as it relates to the
 
04:21:23.570 --> 04:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement of civil orders in RSA 1046
 
04:21:25.250 --> 04:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
there is a condition on civil order
 
04:21:27.889 --> 04:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
enforcement to say quote notwithstanding
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
any law to the contrary end quote and I
 
04:21:31.790 --> 04:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
ask that the same language carry on much
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill I'm happy to assist a
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
member of this Committee in drafting the
 
04:21:37.729 --> 04:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
amendment and finally this bill was
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
requested by constituent in Grafton uh
 
04:21:41.689 --> 04:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I'll take any
 
04:21:41.699 --> 04:21:42.650 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I'll take any
questions

04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:21:45.610 --> 04:21:45.620 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
04:21:49.969 --> 04:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:21:49.979 --> 04:21:51.969 align:start position:0%
thank you
why

04:21:51.969 --> 04:21:51.979 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:21:54.830 --> 04:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
are the sheriff's departments opposed to
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they will tell you but it's
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's I guess it's one of their main
 
04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
revenue streams and it's something they
 
04:22:05.330 --> 04:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
already do
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
um it's some in
 
04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh in talking to my to my County Sheriff
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
he you know he's opposed to this bill
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
but he understands the reason you know
 
04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's kind of math right it's nine
 
04:22:19.130 --> 04:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
dollars uh for to for him to serve
 
04:22:20.809 --> 04:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
papers in Haverhill and 88 dollars
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's a large markup
 
04:22:25.849 --> 04:22:25.859 align:start position:0%
um so he understands that part of it but
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's um you know that's something the
 
04:22:29.330 --> 04:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
sheriffs do and the local police don't
 
04:22:31.490 --> 04:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
and so I think a lot of it is just kind
 
04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
of going with what's what um
 
04:22:34.439 --> 04:22:36.710 align:start position:0%
of going with what's what um
yes

04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:22:40.550 --> 04:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
I also um spoke with the sheriff in my
 
04:22:43.610 --> 04:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
area as well and he was opposed to it I
 
04:22:47.150 --> 04:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
see where it is a bigger issue for more
 
04:22:50.290 --> 04:22:50.300 align:start position:0%
remote towns in um
 
04:22:53.929 --> 04:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire is there I guess it
 
04:22:55.969 --> 04:22:55.979 align:start position:0%
has to be either one for all or all for
 
04:22:59.330 --> 04:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
one correct it couldn't be that maybe
 
04:22:59.340 --> 04:23:00.530 align:start position:0%
one correct it couldn't be that maybe
we're

04:23:00.530 --> 04:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:23:03.170 --> 04:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
um more like in Grafton County whereas
 
04:23:05.570 --> 04:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
I'm in Londonderry so
 
04:23:05.580 --> 04:23:06.170 align:start position:0%
I'm in Londonderry so
um

04:23:06.170 --> 04:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:09.650 --> 04:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
you know we're more condensed
 
04:23:12.290 --> 04:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
I can say that so I represent uh four
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
towns two of the police Chiefs said
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
they're opposed to this bill one of them
 
04:23:17.809 --> 04:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
didn't get back to me and then the
 
04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
Grafton police she said he's willing you
 
04:23:20.929 --> 04:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
know he's neutral on the bill but he's
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
willing to do it if it passes for
 
04:23:22.319 --> 04:23:23.689 align:start position:0%
willing to do it if it passes for
Grafton

04:23:23.689 --> 04:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
Grafton
 
04:23:26.750 --> 04:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's not so much a concern
 
04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
that suddenly a whole bunch of police
 
04:23:29.870 --> 04:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
departments in New Hampshire are going
 
04:23:31.130 --> 04:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
to start doing this and that will take
 
04:23:33.650 --> 04:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
money from the sheriff I think there
 
04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
will only be a small number that are
 
04:23:37.370 --> 04:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
willing to do this and it's it's
 
04:23:38.990 --> 04:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
probably going to be places where the
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
town is very far from the just like
 
04:23:42.830 --> 04:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
Grafton they're very far and it makes
 
04:23:45.110 --> 04:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
sense for them to do it
 
04:23:46.370 --> 04:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
that's right representative Smith did
 
04:23:47.809 --> 04:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
04:23:50.030 --> 04:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry no then representative uh
 
04:23:52.309 --> 04:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:23:54.050 --> 04:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
uh you said this is optional uh I I
 
04:23:59.929 --> 04:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
don't see where it is
 
04:24:02.210 --> 04:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
but uh that doesn't mean that it's not
 
04:24:04.849 --> 04:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
optional so uh but it I do have a
 
04:24:07.729 --> 04:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
question that uh I would assume that
 
04:24:10.250 --> 04:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
this is something that if it is adopted
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:18.710 --> 04:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
well I'm not sure what you mean it would
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
be the local Chief it would be up to
 
04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
them whether they offer the services it
 
04:24:24.710 --> 04:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
would be up to the local chief
 
04:24:27.710 --> 04:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
so that the the County Commissioners
 
04:24:30.110 --> 04:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any say in it
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
be in it no
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
the county would not like well like
 
04:24:36.720 --> 04:24:39.950 align:start position:0%
the county would not like well like
uh

04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:39.960 --> 04:24:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:24:41.630 --> 04:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:24:43.130 --> 04:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
that answers my question thank you
 
04:24:44.990 --> 04:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
um have there been any issues with uh
 
04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
the Grafton County sheriff or any other
 
04:24:53.330 --> 04:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
Sheriff refusing to um
 
04:24:56.530 --> 04:24:56.540 align:start position:0%
refusing to file a criminal or civil
 
04:25:00.290 --> 04:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
processes that you're that uh
 
04:25:02.450 --> 04:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
your constituents want to have filed for
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
04:25:06.170 --> 04:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
so the the reason for this bill in the
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
first place is I have a constituent that
 
04:25:11.150 --> 04:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
has had issues with the county sheriff
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason for the bill
 
04:25:16.670 --> 04:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
um you know it is it is two hours of
 
04:25:18.290 --> 04:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
driving so
 
04:25:20.330 --> 04:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
the sheriff probably has to plan this
 
04:25:21.650 --> 04:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
ahead of time that he's going to have
 
04:25:23.210 --> 04:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
somebody come out and so it's not
 
04:25:25.969 --> 04:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
something they can just do on a moment's
 
04:25:28.250 --> 04:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
notice and one of the issues that this
 
04:25:30.050 --> 04:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
constituent has had is that he knows
 
04:25:31.309 --> 04:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
where somebody is that needs to be
 
04:25:33.290 --> 04:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
served and if he calls up the sheriff
 
04:25:34.910 --> 04:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
and says hey I know where the guy is he
 
04:25:36.769 --> 04:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
might not be there for for long can you
 
04:25:38.830 --> 04:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
serve him you know the sheriff is
 
04:25:41.870 --> 04:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
physically limited by an hour and 20
 
04:25:44.929 --> 04:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
minute drive to get there and that that
 
04:25:48.910 --> 04:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
can these um
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
does this function have to be just the
 
04:25:56.689 --> 04:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
sheriff himself or herself or can they
 
04:25:59.389 --> 04:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
send a uh a deputy to do that instead
 
04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
would say yes they can send the deputy
 
04:26:04.189 --> 04:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
sure and um
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe a follow-up a second follow-up
 
04:26:06.600 --> 04:26:08.210 align:start position:0%
and maybe a follow-up a second follow-up
and

04:26:08.210 --> 04:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
um do you have any reservations about uh
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
eroding the historical role of the
 
04:26:14.330 --> 04:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
counties and the sheriffs which are
 
04:26:15.889 --> 04:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
different from that of the
 
04:26:18.110 --> 04:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the police forces of
 
04:26:21.229 --> 04:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
course that may be uh there may be a
 
04:26:22.849 --> 04:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
relic of an error when the sheriff's had
 
04:26:25.070 --> 04:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
much wider Powers than they do today but
 
04:26:27.410 --> 04:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
like is is there do you have any
 
04:26:28.969 --> 04:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
reservations about
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
allowing the municipality to take on a
 
04:26:32.450 --> 04:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
function that for you know really
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
centuries has been the uh within the
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
purview of the county
 
04:26:41.689 --> 04:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.450 --> 04:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
I I think that this bill tries to solve
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
a specific problem in the simplest way
 
04:26:46.800 --> 04:26:48.410 align:start position:0%
a specific problem in the simplest way
possible

04:26:48.410 --> 04:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:26:49.849 --> 04:26:49.859 align:start position:0%
um there there are other ways that were
 
04:26:52.130 --> 04:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
suggested for example instead of having
 
04:26:54.410 --> 04:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
the local police do it to have
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
um you can have bounty hunters I guess
 
04:27:00.050 --> 04:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
or or a Justice of the Peace sort of
 
04:27:02.929 --> 04:27:02.939 align:start position:0%
process so you know that's another way
 
04:27:04.550 --> 04:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
where you don't involve the local police
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
in in doing the Civil process but that
 
04:27:10.250 --> 04:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
that seems like that would be a much
 
04:27:12.290 --> 04:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
larger piece of legislation than simply
 
04:27:13.969 --> 04:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
enabling the local police to do it if
 
04:27:15.410 --> 04:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
they choose so
 
04:27:18.110 --> 04:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
all right representative D Lorenzo
 
04:27:20.210 --> 04:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:27:22.250 --> 04:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
know on its face this bill seems like a
 
04:27:26.750 --> 04:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
symbol built
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
um authorizing our Law Enforcement
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
Officers to serve um criminal or civil
 
04:27:33.110 --> 04:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
process and to enforce civil orders
 
04:27:35.389 --> 04:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
issued by any court but when I look on
 
04:27:38.030 --> 04:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
page two
 
04:27:43.490 --> 04:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
session 105 colon 3 line four
 
04:27:45.710 --> 04:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
all police officers are by virtue or
 
04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
their appointment constables and
 
04:27:49.130 --> 04:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
conservatives of the peace they shall
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
have the authority to serve criminal and
 
04:27:55.610 --> 04:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
or civil processes investigate crimes in
 
04:27:58.130 --> 04:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
voice civil orders issued by any court
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
and to pursue and apprehend criminals
 
04:28:01.849 --> 04:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
that have
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
that have been that that they have in
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
their respective jurisdictions
 
04:28:07.680 --> 04:28:09.710 align:start position:0%
their respective jurisdictions
um

04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:12.530 --> 04:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
as far as um the pursuant
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
but so and so bomb in apprehensible
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
criminals is that the law now that
 
04:28:19.439 --> 04:28:20.750 align:start position:0%
criminals is that the law now that
any

04:28:20.750 --> 04:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:28:22.969 --> 04:28:22.979 align:start position:0%
local PD can
 
04:28:22.979 --> 04:28:24.830 align:start position:0%
local PD can
pursue

04:28:24.830 --> 04:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
pursue
 
04:28:24.840 --> 04:28:28.010 align:start position:0%
pursue
criminals

04:28:28.010 --> 04:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
wherever they are I believe it is and
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
that was the way it was explained to me
 
04:28:38.450 --> 04:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:41.330 --> 04:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
so have you had any feedback from local
 
04:28:44.689 --> 04:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
departments on how they feel about you
 
04:28:44.699 --> 04:28:45.649 align:start position:0%
departments on how they feel about you
know

04:28:45.649 --> 04:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
people from other districts going into
 
04:28:50.269 --> 04:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
their District to pursue criminals
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this lets them do that
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
it specifically says in their
 
04:29:01.370 --> 04:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:03.469 --> 04:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
see now I guess I do have a couple I
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm wondering is have
 
04:29:09.889 --> 04:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
have you talked to any police
 
04:29:12.110 --> 04:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
departments that have said they want to
 
04:29:14.330 --> 04:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
do this in other words I realize this is
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
only a proposed authorization but
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
unless I'm missing my guess I don't
 
04:29:21.410 --> 04:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
think you're going to have a lot of
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
police departments that are going to say
 
04:29:25.610 --> 04:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we want to start doing this
 
04:29:25.620 --> 04:29:27.110 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we want to start doing this
unless

04:29:27.110 --> 04:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
unless
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know they're going to go to their
 
04:29:31.370 --> 04:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
towns and say we want we need three more
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
officers uh here's here's how much the
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
budget's going to increase
 
04:29:37.610 --> 04:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
so I spoke to three police Chiefs out of
 
04:29:39.050 --> 04:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
the four times that represent two of
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
them one of them is just against it one
 
04:29:43.550 --> 04:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
of them is very against it and one of
 
04:29:45.530 --> 04:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
them is neutral so none of them are for
 
04:29:47.330 --> 04:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
it the one who's neutral is for is
 
04:29:49.130 --> 04:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
grafton's police chief and he
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
understands the problem it's the most
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
acute and Grafton so he you know he's if
 
04:29:55.490 --> 04:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
the bill passes he's willing to to go
 
04:29:58.010 --> 04:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
through the process to help craft and do
 
04:29:58.020 --> 04:29:58.910 align:start position:0%
through the process to help craft and do
this

04:29:58.910 --> 04:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:30:01.370 --> 04:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
other question yes representative Tripp
 
04:30:03.170 --> 04:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:30:06.769 --> 04:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
I I still don't understand
 
04:30:08.889 --> 04:30:08.899 align:start position:0%
the adoption process
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
so this is something that would be done
 
04:30:15.170 --> 04:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's just it just enables the police
 
04:30:20.990 --> 04:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
chief to offer this as a service this it
 
04:30:22.429 --> 04:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
would be they either offer it or they
 
04:30:23.689 --> 04:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
don't and
 
04:30:25.729 --> 04:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
if they have the resources or they can
 
04:30:27.649 --> 04:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
hire the resources if they think there
 
04:30:29.149 --> 04:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
will be enough demand
 
04:30:29.159 --> 04:30:31.010 align:start position:0%
will be enough demand
well

04:30:31.010 --> 04:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:30:34.610 --> 04:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
if they're going to be delivering uh
 
04:30:38.149 --> 04:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
notices or whatever how would they
 
04:30:41.149 --> 04:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
obtain these notices that uh because I
 
04:30:42.889 --> 04:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
I've been served a couple times myself
 
04:30:45.170 --> 04:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
as a function of being on the town
 
04:30:47.210 --> 04:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
console not not because I did something
 
04:30:47.220 --> 04:30:48.170 align:start position:0%
console not not because I did something
wrong

04:30:48.170 --> 04:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:30:48.180 --> 04:30:48.790 align:start position:0%
wrong
yeah

04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:30:51.229 --> 04:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:30:54.889 --> 04:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
and uh you know these came from
 
04:30:54.899 --> 04:30:55.849 align:start position:0%
and uh you know these came from
uh

04:30:55.849 --> 04:30:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:58.370 --> 04:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
like the state or something so you know
 
04:31:00.050 --> 04:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
how How would how would that be
 
04:31:02.030 --> 04:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
accommodated because you know for them
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
to serve the papers they have to get the
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
papers in some manner you know and the
 
04:31:11.210 --> 04:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
people that are do
 
04:31:13.130 --> 04:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
providing the papers to be served they
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
have to know
 
04:31:17.149 --> 04:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
that the police are doing this now and
 
04:31:20.809 --> 04:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
not the county sheriffs so how is this
 
04:31:22.130 --> 04:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
going to work out
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
is it well this doesn't uh it's still up
 
04:31:27.410 --> 04:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
to the sheriff that's the last line of
 
04:31:29.689 --> 04:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
sort of it's their responsibility to do
 
04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
it this just allows the local police to
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
do and it and it could be that in
 
04:31:35.809 --> 04:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
particular case of Grafton uh if the
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
sheriff can't come out he could uh ask
 
04:31:40.429 --> 04:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
the police the local police to do it for
 
04:31:40.439 --> 04:31:41.269 align:start position:0%
the police the local police to do it for
example

04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
right so if the sheriff has the the
 
04:31:46.130 --> 04:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
paperwork and and they you know it's
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
going to be in our a 135 Mile Drive they
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
could uh send it to the local police
 
04:31:55.010 --> 04:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
chief to to perform that to drive out
 
04:31:56.830 --> 04:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
and serve the papers
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah well thank you very much other
 
04:32:01.490 --> 04:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
other questions I have just I guess I
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
have just one other question you
 
04:32:04.849 --> 04:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this was a you proposed
 
04:32:07.250 --> 04:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
to set the request of a constituent can
 
04:32:08.929 --> 04:32:08.939 align:start position:0%
I just ask other than this one
 
04:32:10.729 --> 04:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
constituent I mean
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
do we is there any evidence that there's
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
sort of a Groundswell of complaints
 
04:32:19.610 --> 04:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
among the citizens that you know my God
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is a huge issue
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
that that uh the sheriffs are the ones
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
that serve process and
 
04:32:29.689 --> 04:32:29.699 align:start position:0%
um we got to change this
 
04:32:32.990 --> 04:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
so uh I can give the example by way of
 
04:32:34.670 --> 04:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
why one of the Chiefs was very much
 
04:32:37.370 --> 04:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
against this bill is he believes that if
 
04:32:39.349 --> 04:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
the bill passes even if even if it's
 
04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
optional he believes that some business
 
04:32:43.729 --> 04:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
owners in the town will will demand that
 
04:32:45.710 --> 04:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
he provide the service
 
04:32:48.349 --> 04:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
so there is definitely there would
 
04:32:50.809 --> 04:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
definitely be a demand for this
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:01.010 --> 04:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry next we have uh William Wright
 
04:33:06.410 --> 04:33:06.420 align:start position:0%

okay for consideration and determination
 
04:33:53.929 --> 04:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
uh on the need for such legislation as
 
04:33:56.990 --> 04:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
proposed in this house bill 187 month
 
04:33:59.631 --> 04:33:59.641 align:start position:0%
one must examine the past practices in
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
the current legislation currently on
 
04:34:01.080 --> 04:34:02.390 align:start position:0%
the current legislation currently on
hand

04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
hand
 
04:34:05.631 --> 04:34:05.641 align:start position:0%
the sheriff and sheriff's deputies are
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
clearly our our roles and
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are clearly defined in
 
04:34:09.949 --> 04:34:09.959 align:start position:0%
RSA 104
 
04:34:15.650 --> 04:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
further our powers are also defined in
 
04:34:22.490 --> 04:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
RSA 1046 there's remedies for neglect of
 
04:34:25.010 --> 04:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
Duty which is found in 104 colon 10
 
04:34:27.529 --> 04:34:27.539 align:start position:0%
which if we don't serve civil process uh
 
04:34:29.209 --> 04:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
accordingly or if we refuse to do it
 
04:34:31.609 --> 04:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
there are penalties that that we have to
 
04:34:34.970 --> 04:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
face specifically as the sheriff
 
04:34:37.490 --> 04:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
various writs and precipes uh they get
 
04:34:39.410 --> 04:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
delivered to the Sheriff's Office
 
04:34:41.209 --> 04:34:41.219 align:start position:0%
in many different manners
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
some of them are emailed some of them
 
04:34:45.170 --> 04:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
are handed directly by the clerk of
 
04:34:47.150 --> 04:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
court some are done to The Postal
 
04:34:49.250 --> 04:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
Service and others are when the
 
04:34:50.510 --> 04:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
respondent actually comes to the
 
04:34:51.769 --> 04:34:51.779 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Office and delivers the
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork in hand
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
should this particular bill become law
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
the question is going to come into play
 
04:35:02.689 --> 04:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
as to where these papers are taken in
 
04:35:05.631 --> 04:35:05.641 align:start position:0%
who reports what paperwork was taken in
 
04:35:08.209 --> 04:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
who they're reporting it to who collects
 
04:35:10.250 --> 04:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
the fees how many more government
 
04:35:12.250 --> 04:35:12.260 align:start position:0%
entities are involved in this process
 
04:35:15.170 --> 04:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
how do the sheriffs if we're ultimately
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
responsible for this under the law
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
currently under 104
 
04:35:21.051 --> 04:35:21.061 align:start position:0%
how are we going to determine what local
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
departments have decided today that they
 
04:35:24.650 --> 04:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
want to serve the process and tomorrow
 
04:35:26.029 --> 04:35:26.039 align:start position:0%
they do not
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
we go before the delegation each
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
respected Sheriff goes uh before the
 
04:35:30.240 --> 04:35:31.490 align:start position:0%
respected Sheriff goes uh before the
delegations

04:35:31.490 --> 04:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
delegations
 
04:35:34.250 --> 04:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
to ask for uh monies for personnel right
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
and salary lines and we staff based on
 
04:35:39.650 --> 04:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
what we project is going to happen in
 
04:35:41.929 --> 04:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
the future we don't have the ability to
 
04:35:43.730 --> 04:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
necessarily say well one Town's going to
 
04:35:45.949 --> 04:35:45.959 align:start position:0%
ask us to or they're going to ask to
 
04:35:47.689 --> 04:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
serve the paperwork today but not
 
04:35:50.209 --> 04:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we don't we can't predict that
 
04:35:54.051 --> 04:35:54.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:56.269 --> 04:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
other things that we got to look at is
 
04:35:58.010 --> 04:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
whether or not local departments there's
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
over 240 police departments spread
 
04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire
 
04:36:04.730 --> 04:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
out of those
 
04:36:06.890 --> 04:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
some of them work some of the time some
 
04:36:09.051 --> 04:36:09.061 align:start position:0%
work all of the time you know they have
 
04:36:10.490 --> 04:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
24 hours seven day a week coverage
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
others do not this then comes into a
 
04:36:14.810 --> 04:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
complexity as to what political
 
04:36:17.090 --> 04:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
pressures are happening uh for those
 
04:36:18.529 --> 04:36:18.539 align:start position:0%
people who are asking for the Civil
 
04:36:21.051 --> 04:36:21.061 align:start position:0%
process or the writs and precepts to be
 
04:36:21.061 --> 04:36:22.670 align:start position:0%
process or the writs and precepts to be
delivered

04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
04:36:24.410 --> 04:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
if they don't have the Staffing on at
 
04:36:26.269 --> 04:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
that given time who's then responsible
 
04:36:28.250 --> 04:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
for it is it the sheriff
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
is it the the local PD
 
04:36:33.051 --> 04:36:33.061 align:start position:0%
is it controlled by the Selectmen or or
 
04:36:35.209 --> 04:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
that particular city council those are
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
all questions that are uh complex as it
 
04:36:41.449 --> 04:36:41.459 align:start position:0%
relates to just this enabling uh statute
 
04:36:43.609 --> 04:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
as it was proposed
 
04:36:45.289 --> 04:36:45.299 align:start position:0%
other things that we got to look at is
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh the sheriff's offices have been
 
04:36:49.010 --> 04:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
around since the 1800s we were the first
 
04:36:50.929 --> 04:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
former law enforcement uh here in our
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
state and we've been doing these tasks
 
04:36:55.490 --> 04:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
since that time
 
04:36:58.189 --> 04:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
we have people who are trained in civil
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
process civil laws as well as the
 
04:37:02.449 --> 04:37:02.459 align:start position:0%
service of all the documents that come
 
04:37:03.769 --> 04:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
from the courts or competent
 
04:37:03.779 --> 04:37:05.689 align:start position:0%
from the courts or competent
jurisdiction

04:37:05.689 --> 04:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
04:37:08.090 --> 04:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
we're the go-to people but when local
 
04:37:10.010 --> 04:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
departments don't know what to do with
 
04:37:10.910 --> 04:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
this stuff
 
04:37:12.890 --> 04:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
we're also the ones that report
 
04:37:14.570 --> 04:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
everything that we have to our
 
04:37:17.090 --> 04:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
commissioners and to our Representatives
 
04:37:19.970 --> 04:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
also making up the delegations
 
04:37:22.490 --> 04:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge Revenue stream we do not
 
04:37:26.090 --> 04:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh we are not a a for-profit business if
 
04:37:26.929 --> 04:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
you will
 
04:37:29.209 --> 04:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
we we operate Sheriff's offices and we
 
04:37:30.830 --> 04:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
try to offset
 
04:37:32.929 --> 04:37:32.939 align:start position:0%
um our budgets based on some of the
 
04:37:34.429 --> 04:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
revenue that comes in through civil
 
04:37:34.439 --> 04:37:35.269 align:start position:0%
revenue that comes in through civil
process

04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
this civil process is customer based
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's people who own uh properties
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
and are asking for services to be done
 
04:37:45.170 --> 04:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
that's according to law
 
04:37:47.029 --> 04:37:47.039 align:start position:0%
as a relation to that again it's
 
04:37:49.369 --> 04:37:49.379 align:start position:0%
offsetting the costs for the for the
 
04:37:50.929 --> 04:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
remainder of the taxpayers that are
 
04:37:52.849 --> 04:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
paying for the services of the sheriff's
 
04:37:54.890 --> 04:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
office which again when you look at RSA
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
104 it describes four primary functions
 
04:37:59.209 --> 04:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
that Sheriff's offices are required for
 
04:38:02.990 --> 04:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
in uh serving and executing uh written
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
precepts are one of those
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay one of the things I I first off I I
 
04:38:11.929 --> 04:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
certainly concur with what my um what my
 
04:38:16.131 --> 04:38:16.141 align:start position:0%
uh bordering Sheriff said to uh to to
 
04:38:18.529 --> 04:38:18.539 align:start position:0%
all of you one of my concerns is that
 
04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
when this bill first was uh brought I um
 
04:38:24.170 --> 04:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
had a lot of conversation with the
 
04:38:26.689 --> 04:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs within my County I haven't
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
spoken with all of them but I've spoken
 
04:38:30.529 --> 04:38:30.539 align:start position:0%
with the majority of them and I think
 
04:38:33.289 --> 04:38:33.299 align:start position:0%
you're probably all aware uh right now
 
04:38:35.810 --> 04:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
as far as law enforcement is concerned
 
04:38:38.929 --> 04:38:38.939 align:start position:0%
we're in a terrible Place one that I've
 
04:38:41.209 --> 04:38:41.219 align:start position:0%
never seen in the 40 years that I've
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
been involved in law enforcement and
 
04:38:44.689 --> 04:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
when I say that I'm talking about
 
04:38:47.689 --> 04:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
recruitment the latest numbers with our
 
04:38:49.490 --> 04:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
state police are somewhere about 80
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
Troopers down my County Jail is down
 
04:38:55.369 --> 04:38:55.379 align:start position:0%
approximately 35 correctional offices
 
04:38:58.609 --> 04:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
the numbers in our County state prisons
 
04:39:01.789 --> 04:39:01.799 align:start position:0%
are close to a hundred and this this is
 
04:39:04.250 --> 04:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
going uh right out into my local police
 
04:39:06.051 --> 04:39:06.061 align:start position:0%
departments as well
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
um I received a call from one of my
 
04:39:10.970 --> 04:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
Deputy Chiefs in my largest community in
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County last night asking if I
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
could render assistance in handling
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
calls because they are so down on
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
Personnel that they're they're very
 
04:39:25.010 --> 04:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
concerned about being able to put out a
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
whole Force so my point being is
 
04:39:31.250 --> 04:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
um when when they saw this bill coming
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
they were very concerned that if this
 
04:39:38.810 --> 04:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
was an option that was going to be
 
04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
available for a citizen to come and ask
 
04:39:44.090 --> 04:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
that this process be done by them
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
they're very concerned that they are not
 
04:39:48.050 --> 04:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
going to have the Personnel to be able
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
to do this uh and I know that the
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative presenting presenting the
 
04:39:55.010 --> 04:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
bill indicated that this isn't going to
 
04:39:57.288 --> 04:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
be a requirement but
 
04:39:59.630 --> 04:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
I I will tell you that my police Chiefs
 
04:40:02.690 --> 04:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
are very very concerned that they're not
 
04:40:04.910 --> 04:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
having enough people to handle their
 
04:40:07.130 --> 04:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
daily calls now if they were to be
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
inundated with something like this they
 
04:40:11.810 --> 04:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
don't know how they could handle it
 
04:40:14.208 --> 04:40:14.218 align:start position:0%
I too have reached out to the police
 
04:40:17.630 --> 04:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
chief of the largest or largest uh City
 
04:40:19.550 --> 04:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
in my County which happens to be Laconia
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
and chief Canfield indicated to me that
 
04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
he has zero interest in having uh
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
himself or his Personnel out serving
 
04:40:28.490 --> 04:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
civil process or doing the business of
 
04:40:32.090 --> 04:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
the sheriff uh within his uh City and he
 
04:40:34.850 --> 04:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
probably has the best staffed the most
 
04:40:37.368 --> 04:40:37.378 align:start position:0%
staffed Department in our County as well
 
04:40:38.750 --> 04:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
as they're probably one of the better
 
04:40:42.050 --> 04:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
trained so having that it builds concern
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
for me for uh even the smaller
 
04:40:45.650 --> 04:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that we predominantly
 
04:40:48.410 --> 04:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
support So in closing I ask that you
 
04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
find House Bill 187 in expedient to
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
legislature and that will conclude my
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
testimony anything further you want to
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
say sure no thank you all right
 
04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
questions for from the committee
 
04:41:02.510 --> 04:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan do you have a
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you under
 
04:41:07.070 --> 04:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
I mean this uh your history goes a long
 
04:41:08.690 --> 04:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
way back and I guess back when you
 
04:41:10.490 --> 04:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
started doing this you did many of the
 
04:41:12.110 --> 04:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
functions of the court clerks but that
 
04:41:13.970 --> 04:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
was a long time ago but my question is
 
04:41:16.010 --> 04:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
under the current system what's our
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
quality control is there on the civil
 
04:41:20.810 --> 04:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
and criminal processes do you have to
 
04:41:22.250 --> 04:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
file just any piece of paper that
 
04:41:24.650 --> 04:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
anybody thinks is a valid civil or
 
04:41:27.288 --> 04:41:27.298 align:start position:0%
criminal process or who likes or brief
 
04:41:29.810 --> 04:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
processes it for you before you take it
 
04:41:32.570 --> 04:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
out and try to serve it
 
04:41:34.970 --> 04:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
so it's vetted by the courts so we get
 
04:41:36.590 --> 04:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
predominantly the court paperwork that
 
04:41:38.030 --> 04:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
comes in and we'll take a look at that
 
04:41:41.090 --> 04:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
in my particular case I have a Civil
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
Division supervisor that will look at
 
04:41:44.990 --> 04:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
that paperwork and ensure that there's
 
04:41:47.690 --> 04:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
no uh immediate issues that we can see
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
that might violate somebody's
 
04:41:50.690 --> 04:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights as we are the only
 
04:41:55.430 --> 04:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional officers uh uh here and
 
04:41:55.440 --> 04:41:56.030 align:start position:0%
constitutional officers uh uh here and
um

04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:58.730 --> 04:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
we also if there is a problem we contact
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
the courts immediately before it goes
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
out for service to make sure that
 
04:42:04.490 --> 04:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
whatever is the problem is rectified
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
before we get there
 
04:42:09.230 --> 04:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
I also representative have that same
 
04:42:12.830 --> 04:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
type of procedure in place
 
04:42:14.690 --> 04:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
and um oh
 
04:42:17.868 --> 04:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
and we uh so you if so if we pass this
 
04:42:20.090 --> 04:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
bill then the police officers wouldn't
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
have the same relationship with the
 
04:42:24.288 --> 04:42:24.298 align:start position:0%
courts or I would
 
04:42:27.948 --> 04:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I could answer that
 
04:42:30.530 --> 04:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
and my last one which your counties are
 
04:42:32.510 --> 04:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
both much smaller than Grafton or co-osh
 
04:42:34.430 --> 04:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
but is that
 
04:42:37.250 --> 04:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
you you personally have to serve these
 
04:42:39.230 --> 04:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
Ritz or can you send a deputy who might
 
04:42:41.570 --> 04:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
be located closer to the destination of
 
04:42:42.770 --> 04:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
the because we heard a lot from the
 
04:42:45.410 --> 04:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor about the whatever the 65
 
04:42:48.050 --> 04:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
mile round trip or whatever is from
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
North Haverhill down to down to Grafton
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
but I assume the Grafton County Sheriff
 
04:42:54.470 --> 04:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
must have a hole you've got several
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
deputies who are probably anytime
 
04:42:57.770 --> 04:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
working in different parts of the county
 
04:42:59.810 --> 04:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
is that chewing your slightly smaller
 
04:43:02.570 --> 04:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
counties that is correct I have a civil
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
unit consisting of five deputies
 
04:43:08.030 --> 04:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
and in Belknap County I have several
 
04:43:09.770 --> 04:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
deputies that are out there so they have
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
the ability everything has to start at
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's office so we can log that
 
04:43:15.050 --> 04:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
paperwork and we can vet that paperwork
 
04:43:16.970 --> 04:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
to ensure that there are no problems so
 
04:43:19.250 --> 04:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh traditionally that's where the
 
04:43:21.170 --> 04:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
mileage starts is where that home base
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
is so where the paperwork comes in and
 
04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
yes they do concentrate on certain areas
 
04:43:27.770 --> 04:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
in our particular case uh and this is a
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
process just for my agency Alone
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
um deputies will pick certain towns that
 
04:43:33.410 --> 04:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
they're going to go in sort of
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
processing in any given day Barnstead is
 
04:43:37.788 --> 04:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
probably one of the furthest away
 
04:43:41.150 --> 04:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
between Barnstead and Central Harbor so
 
04:43:42.470 --> 04:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll take the paperwork for
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
them towns as well as any corresponding
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
town that might be to and from in the
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
well sort of a group of paperwork at
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
that given time great thanks thanks
 
04:43:52.670 --> 04:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
other questions from members of the
 
04:43:52.680 --> 04:43:54.050 align:start position:0%
other questions from members of the
committee

04:43:54.050 --> 04:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:43:56.690 --> 04:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:44:00.890 --> 04:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
um Anson Smith there's Anson Smith here
 
04:44:13.150 --> 04:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.310 --> 04:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.320 --> 04:44:23.930 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:44:23.930 --> 04:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:44:31.690 --> 04:44:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's no form up front if I want to go
 
04:44:36.948 --> 04:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
someplace like to a website or even make
 
04:44:39.530 --> 04:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
a telephone call to find out did this
 
04:44:41.990 --> 04:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
warrant get served and I'm talking right
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
now mostly about benchmarks so this is
 
04:44:45.890 --> 04:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
something where someone didn't show up
 
04:44:48.170 --> 04:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
in court or
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
for some reason the judge
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
wants them to show up the next time
 
04:44:56.090 --> 04:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
so uh there's no way you can go can you
 
04:44:57.530 --> 04:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
go on a website and say okay here's my
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
one what's the process where is it has
 
04:45:02.330 --> 04:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
it been served no no call up the
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
sheriff's office and they don't seem to
 
04:45:06.110 --> 04:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
know a lot about what's going on up
 
04:45:07.490 --> 04:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
there either they didn't know how many
 
04:45:09.830 --> 04:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
warrants they had out for service they
 
04:45:10.910 --> 04:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know how many had accumulated
 
04:45:12.170 --> 04:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
they didn't know how many they get per
 
04:45:16.128 --> 04:45:16.138 align:start position:0%
month or for anyway so I filed the uh I
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
think you guys call him a pretty
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
Information Act
 
04:45:23.448 --> 04:45:23.458 align:start position:0%
and found out that in the county in the
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
Grafton County Sheriff's Department he
 
04:45:28.788 --> 04:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
told the sheriff told me in writing he
 
04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
gets 13 of these things in a six month
 
04:45:33.170 --> 04:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
period in time boy there's an overload
 
04:45:34.430 --> 04:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
for you
 
04:45:37.368 --> 04:45:37.378 align:start position:0%
okay I also want to make mention of you
 
04:45:38.690 --> 04:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
people have been around a little while
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
some 10 or more years ago they started
 
04:45:43.550 --> 04:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
doing video things for the court in
 
04:45:44.990 --> 04:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
other words these sheriffs used to be
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
trotting these perps around in Crown
 
04:45:47.638 --> 04:45:48.530 align:start position:0%
trotting these perps around in Crown
Vics

04:45:48.530 --> 04:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
Vics
 
04:45:50.510 --> 04:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
taking them to their Court hearings and
 
04:45:53.090 --> 04:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
bringing them back well a lot of that
 
04:45:54.350 --> 04:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
has been done away with it I don't know
 
04:45:55.610 --> 04:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
how much
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
but I didn't hear any Sheriff's coming
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
around and said well gee we got some
 
04:46:00.288 --> 04:46:00.298 align:start position:0%
extra people now we don't have to drive
 
04:46:02.030 --> 04:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
all these people around
 
04:46:03.770 --> 04:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
but now we come up with something we
 
04:46:05.810 --> 04:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
might not ask them to do I know they
 
04:46:08.090 --> 04:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
don't have their personnel okay
 
04:46:12.170 --> 04:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
there's two sides of this coin uh
 
04:46:12.180 --> 04:46:14.030 align:start position:0%
there's two sides of this coin uh
the

04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:46:16.250 --> 04:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
business about Grafton being at the
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
other end of the county
 
04:46:20.750 --> 04:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
where is the price for Hayward was worth
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars or something and for me
 
04:46:25.490 --> 04:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's over a hundred the the
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
actual fee was structured as I think you
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
just mentioned that but then there's uh
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
some other fees that go on top of that
 
04:46:33.240 --> 04:46:34.250 align:start position:0%
some other fees that go on top of that
um

04:46:34.250 --> 04:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
and we don't know whether we got it done
 
04:46:37.850 --> 04:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
I want to take you back now too or
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
something I don't know if any of you
 
04:46:40.670 --> 04:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
people remember this this took place I
 
04:46:42.970 --> 04:46:42.980 align:start position:0%
believe in
 
04:46:46.250 --> 04:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
2017 I think there was a fellow named
 
04:46:48.170 --> 04:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
Jesse Campbell
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
who was shot to death in the car in the
 
04:46:53.208 --> 04:46:53.218 align:start position:0%
town of Grafton you know I wonder if you
 
04:46:56.090 --> 04:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
could tell sir I I what
 
04:47:00.170 --> 04:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
I guess I want to know you how is this
 
04:47:03.050 --> 04:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
relevant to the issue here of service of
 
04:47:05.868 --> 04:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
of process by someone other than the
 
04:47:05.878 --> 04:47:07.730 align:start position:0%
of process by someone other than the
sheriff

04:47:07.730 --> 04:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
sheriff
 
04:47:09.050 --> 04:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
I think what I'm trying to tell you
 
04:47:10.610 --> 04:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
these sheriffs really don't have a lot
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
to do and they're going to step up now I
 
04:47:14.270 --> 04:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
don't know about this Europe but that
 
04:47:18.050 --> 04:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
sheriff so so but I guess I'm I'm not
 
04:47:19.128 --> 04:47:19.138 align:start position:0%
clear I mean
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you want the sheriffs to do more it's
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
not clear to me how allowing the local
 
04:47:29.690 --> 04:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
police to take away some of the
 
04:47:31.610 --> 04:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
sheriff's work is going to have the
 
04:47:33.708 --> 04:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
sheriff doing more
 
04:47:35.868 --> 04:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
I want to get my job done all I want is
 
04:47:37.430 --> 04:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
my warrant served I don't really care
 
04:47:39.288 --> 04:47:39.298 align:start position:0%
who does it's going to be lawful
 
04:47:40.970 --> 04:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
so they need this will be other people
 
04:47:43.190 --> 04:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
options I don't care if we point bounty
 
04:47:43.200 --> 04:47:44.330 align:start position:0%
options I don't care if we point bounty
hunters

04:47:44.330 --> 04:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
hunters
 
04:47:46.610 --> 04:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to pay for it these people
 
04:47:48.530 --> 04:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
the sheriff does not even find people
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
they never show up in court and then
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
when they do show up in court if they
 
04:47:55.368 --> 04:47:55.378 align:start position:0%
finally get snapped and which I
 
04:47:57.050 --> 04:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
sometimes make a rumble yeah we had one
 
04:48:01.010 --> 04:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
guy come in and they they
 
04:48:03.350 --> 04:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
forced them to put a bail for his next
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
hearing right well don't you know the
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
next hearing come around he didn't show
 
04:48:08.570 --> 04:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
up before this bill
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is just the court system in this
 
04:48:13.550 --> 04:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
state is atrocious I'm talking a civil
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
cycle not talking criminal but I want to
 
04:48:18.410 --> 04:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
reference a criminal case in Grafton
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
that resulted in the death of a person
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
who did not get served
 
04:48:26.810 --> 04:48:26.820 align:start position:0%
this guy's name was Jesse Jesse um
 
04:48:26.820 --> 04:48:28.490 align:start position:0%
this guy's name was Jesse Jesse um
championing

04:48:28.490 --> 04:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
championing
 
04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
he died and grafted I think it was 2017
 
04:48:34.850 --> 04:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
or thereabouts he was pursued because he
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
was eluding the police and Nano Chase
 
04:48:42.288 --> 04:48:42.298 align:start position:0%
and alleged drug thing that person
 
04:48:45.530 --> 04:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
was put on the was a criminal warrant
 
04:48:48.288 --> 04:48:48.298 align:start position:0%
was issued him for a year before that
 
04:48:50.570 --> 04:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
event they finally caught up to him in a
 
04:48:53.230 --> 04:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
snow field and and uh
 
04:48:56.208 --> 04:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
Canaan was King yeah it was Canada New
 
04:48:56.218 --> 04:48:56.868 align:start position:0%
Canaan was King yeah it was Canada New
Hampshire

04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
and he fled and threatened or whatever
 
04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
they shot him to death he's gone
 
04:49:02.340 --> 04:49:03.530 align:start position:0%
they shot him to death he's gone
so

04:49:03.530 --> 04:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:06.288 --> 04:49:06.298 align:start position:0%
why did he why did it take a year for
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
them to serve this guy it was a million
 
04:49:10.610 --> 04:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
times along the way when they could have
 
04:49:12.590 --> 04:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
served him when he maybe wasn't high or
 
04:49:15.470 --> 04:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
he was wasn't excited or curbed or
 
04:49:18.288 --> 04:49:18.298 align:start position:0%
whatever it was this is a mess
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
and that's the criminal side I'm dealing
 
04:49:24.890 --> 04:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
with the the Civil side no one thinks
 
04:49:27.288 --> 04:49:27.298 align:start position:0%
the process is important
 
04:49:29.868 --> 04:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
it is important for this for the normal
 
04:49:32.810 --> 04:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
conduct of business now I'm a landlord
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
if I can't collect my money
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
what do I have to do I either take the
 
04:49:39.530 --> 04:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
loss or you have to bury that on into
 
04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing going forward
 
04:49:44.030 --> 04:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
because certain people are just not
 
04:49:45.410 --> 04:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
going to pay and there's some of those
 
04:49:46.490 --> 04:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
out there
 
04:49:49.128 --> 04:49:49.138 align:start position:0%
so this is something that is required
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
for the normal contact of a business in
 
04:49:52.850 --> 04:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
a society
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
and in the state
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
so there's many other reasons but
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
and again all right I may have more
 
04:50:02.570 --> 04:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
problems with Grafton County Sheriff
 
04:50:04.010 --> 04:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
than I do with those two guys with the
 
04:50:05.330 --> 04:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
guns behind me
 
04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
all right questions for this Witness
 
04:50:10.490 --> 04:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
any questions all right thank you very
 
04:50:12.170 --> 04:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
much sir appreciate your testimony okay
 
04:50:15.530 --> 04:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you all right is there anyone else
 
04:50:17.690 --> 04:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
here to testify
 
04:50:24.470 --> 04:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
here for you or any just anybody that
 
04:50:28.368 --> 04:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
might be able to is there any kind of
 
04:50:31.970 --> 04:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
tracking on these documents
 
04:50:33.530 --> 04:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
that sounded to me like the biggest
 
04:50:36.288 --> 04:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
complaint he had was that there was no
 
04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative we have a software
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
program referred to as IMC Bell map does
 
04:50:48.350 --> 04:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
as well as soon as we get the
 
04:50:50.270 --> 04:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
documentation in the office it goes into
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
the computer system and it's tracked all
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
the way up to
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
um the date served and a lot of them
 
04:50:57.288 --> 04:50:57.298 align:start position:0%
have restrictions on they need to be
 
04:50:58.490 --> 04:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
served in a certain amount of time
 
04:51:00.650 --> 04:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's our Safeguard as well to to
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that that's done
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know just just for your information
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
just based upon my experience in the
 
04:51:08.990 --> 04:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
court I mean if they're if something has
 
04:51:11.530 --> 04:51:11.540 align:start position:0%
if process has been issued by the court
 
04:51:14.208 --> 04:51:14.218 align:start position:0%
yes there is a track I mean you know if
 
04:51:17.208 --> 04:51:17.218 align:start position:0%
uh if service hasn't been made there is
 
04:51:19.730 --> 04:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
going to be inquiries made about you
 
04:51:21.050 --> 04:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
know periodically I can't tell you
 
04:51:22.490 --> 04:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
exactly how often but there will
 
04:51:24.170 --> 04:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
definitely be inquiries made about what
 
04:51:26.330 --> 04:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
why hasn't this happened what's going on
 
04:51:28.390 --> 04:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:51:33.170 --> 04:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
um all right I guess we're no no
 
04:51:34.730 --> 04:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
additional Witnesses so I'm going to
 
04:52:02.590 --> 04:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:04.730 --> 04:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you I'm going to open the
 
04:52:06.670 --> 04:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
04:52:10.128 --> 04:52:10.138 align:start position:0%
cacr-5 uh relating to fundamental rights
 
04:52:12.590 --> 04:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
providing that the constitution protects
 
04:52:14.708 --> 04:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
the right to marry
 
04:52:14.718 --> 04:52:16.310 align:start position:0%
the right to marry
and

04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:16.320 --> 04:52:19.510 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:24.890 --> 04:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:27.050 --> 04:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the record Dan Hines um
 
04:52:28.610 --> 04:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
ton of Bedford representing Hillsboro
 
04:52:31.128 --> 04:52:31.138 align:start position:0%
too uh says the Constitutional Amendment
 
04:52:34.368 --> 04:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
um pretty straightforward one line it
 
04:52:35.930 --> 04:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
says the right to marry shall be a
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
fundamental right and I think that's
 
04:52:40.128 --> 04:52:40.138 align:start position:0%
something a lot of us take for granted
 
04:52:43.010 --> 04:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
um it's something that um various Court
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
decisions have applied
 
04:52:49.128 --> 04:52:49.138 align:start position:0%
um the issue is in my opinion uh there's
 
04:52:51.770 --> 04:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
no specific constitutional right to
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
marry so while it comes by implicit
 
04:52:56.930 --> 04:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
things due process Etc
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
um we're at the will of Any Given Court
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
finding that there is no right to marry
 
04:53:05.810 --> 04:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
um so this is partly in response to the
 
04:53:07.550 --> 04:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know Supreme Court decision last
 
04:53:09.650 --> 04:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
year Dobbs B Jackson
 
04:53:12.410 --> 04:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
um where in the minority opinion
 
04:53:13.970 --> 04:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
um questioned whether some of the
 
04:53:15.650 --> 04:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
underlying cases that dealt with this
 
04:53:18.288 --> 04:53:18.298 align:start position:0%
might want to be Revisited uh I don't
 
04:53:20.270 --> 04:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
expect the current Court favorably
 
04:53:22.430 --> 04:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
revisit some of those prior cases but we
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what a future Court might do
 
04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
some of those cases include loving V
 
04:53:28.850 --> 04:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
Virginia which gives constitutional
 
04:53:30.650 --> 04:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
right to marry based on race and I know
 
04:53:32.690 --> 04:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
the next bill on this committee is going
 
04:53:34.250 --> 04:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
to address would countify that in state
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
law I would support that the other being
 
04:53:39.650 --> 04:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
of um I'm going to mispronounce it Phil
 
04:53:42.590 --> 04:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
V Hodges in 2015 which I'm codified
 
04:53:45.530 --> 04:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriage and New Hampshire even
 
04:53:47.090 --> 04:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
though those are constitutional rights
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
we we even have it in law for the
 
04:53:52.010 --> 04:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriage um again that bill
 
04:53:54.288 --> 04:53:54.298 align:start position:0%
after this um
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor is seeking to add race
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
to which I think is a good thing so the
 
04:54:01.250 --> 04:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
reason this is needed like I said is we
 
04:54:03.530 --> 04:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
just I think people should
 
04:54:05.330 --> 04:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
they have a constitutional right to
 
04:54:06.890 --> 04:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
marry they expect constitutional right
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
to marry and at the end of the day this
 
04:54:10.610 --> 04:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
does put in front of the voters um so I
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
think certainly should be up to the
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
voters to decide whether they believe
 
04:54:15.650 --> 04:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
they have a constitutional right to
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
marry uh in regards to the language of
 
04:54:20.510 --> 04:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
the bill it is uh trying to make it as
 
04:54:22.250 --> 04:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
simple as possible so it says says the
 
04:54:23.690 --> 04:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
right to marry shall be a fundamental
 
04:54:26.208 --> 04:54:26.218 align:start position:0%
right at the end of the day as we all
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
know Constitutional Amendments and
 
04:54:29.810 --> 04:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
rights are not
 
04:54:31.128 --> 04:54:31.138 align:start position:0%
um unlimited
 
04:54:32.930 --> 04:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
um speech being example
 
04:54:34.430 --> 04:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
um right self-defense being examples
 
04:54:37.128 --> 04:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
there's many limitations on those rights
 
04:54:40.490 --> 04:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
and courts will appropriately apply
 
04:54:42.890 --> 04:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
analysis to that so this doesn't cover
 
04:54:44.270 --> 04:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
every right
 
04:54:46.310 --> 04:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
um the reason I worded the bill as I did
 
04:54:48.530 --> 04:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
is the I just mind it as simple as
 
04:54:50.208 --> 04:54:50.218 align:start position:0%
possible for voters
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
um so it was my thought process that
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's implicit in the language of the
 
04:54:55.910 --> 04:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill that it would be dealing with
 
04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
consensual marriages
 
04:54:59.090 --> 04:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I didn't put in age in
 
04:55:02.448 --> 04:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
the bill I would expect the bill itself
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
to apply to people in the majority the
 
04:55:08.090 --> 04:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
reason I put a specific age is
 
04:55:10.190 --> 04:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
um I guess I felt it was inappropriate
 
04:55:13.128 --> 04:55:13.138 align:start position:0%
to do that but if it were worded as
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
majority I think then the legislature
 
04:55:17.208 --> 04:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
could change that further down the line
 
04:55:19.788 --> 04:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
if need be
 
04:55:19.798 --> 04:55:21.650 align:start position:0%
if need be
um

04:55:21.650 --> 04:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh if the committee did want to amend it
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that it doesn't apply
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
to children or otherwise Limited in some
 
04:55:29.330 --> 04:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
fashion I would still support the bill
 
04:55:31.368 --> 04:55:31.378 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any questions
 
04:55:33.470 --> 04:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
 
04:55:34.850 --> 04:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
04:55:36.050 --> 04:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
04:55:37.310 --> 04:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
um so we're talking about marriage
 
04:55:40.250 --> 04:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
between two people
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
but what I'm concerned about is you have
 
04:55:44.208 --> 04:55:44.218 align:start position:0%
a marriage between eight people right
 
04:55:45.708 --> 04:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
and and you could see the runaway
 
04:55:48.050 --> 04:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
problems when you grant a constitutional
 
04:55:49.610 --> 04:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
right and I understand that sometimes
 
04:55:51.470 --> 04:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's limited in some fashion but would
 
04:55:53.448 --> 04:55:53.458 align:start position:0%
you be amenable to amending that to a
 
04:55:54.770 --> 04:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
marriage between two people is a
 
04:55:56.090 --> 04:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
fundamental right
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess I think the voters should
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
decide whether they want that
 
04:56:03.590 --> 04:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I guess my position would be the
 
04:56:03.600 --> 04:56:06.590 align:start position:0%
um I guess my position would be the
religious

04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:08.448 --> 04:56:08.458 align:start position:0%
I guess it's not my preference but if
 
04:56:09.948 --> 04:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
that were to be limited it still would
 
04:56:11.208 --> 04:56:11.218 align:start position:0%
provide things that I think are
 
04:56:13.190 --> 04:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
important to be there so
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
um that's the best way for me answer
 
04:56:17.448 --> 04:56:17.458 align:start position:0%
that um did you see could you see like
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
somebody petitioning the court to allow
 
04:56:21.530 --> 04:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
for another marriage should this be put
 
04:56:23.150 --> 04:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution and then it could
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
just create a lot more problems than
 
04:56:28.010 --> 04:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
just like specifying it to begin with
 
04:56:29.570 --> 04:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
I guess I could foresee someone doing
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
that um and I think the court would
 
04:56:31.798 --> 04:56:33.170 align:start position:0%
that um and I think the court would
appropriately

04:56:33.170 --> 04:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
04:56:36.288 --> 04:56:36.298 align:start position:0%
apply some type of strictness scrutiny
 
04:56:37.850 --> 04:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the day
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I would leave it up to the courts
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do with that
 
04:56:43.010 --> 04:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess that
 
04:56:45.650 --> 04:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
I foresee that could happen
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
04:56:49.320 --> 04:56:50.270 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
yes

04:56:50.270 --> 04:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you I I've been looking at
 
04:56:53.040 --> 04:56:54.230 align:start position:0%
um thank you I I've been looking at
um

04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:56.690 --> 04:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
the Constitution part first
 
04:56:59.530 --> 04:56:59.540 align:start position:0%
and I was interested that you chose
 
04:57:05.570 --> 04:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
Article 5 rather than for example
 
04:57:07.610 --> 04:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
um Article 2
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
which talks about certain natural
 
04:57:13.128 --> 04:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent rights
 
04:57:13.138 --> 04:57:14.090 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent rights
um

04:57:14.090 --> 04:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:14.100 --> 04:57:15.850 align:start position:0%
um
uh

04:57:15.850 --> 04:57:15.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:57:20.810 --> 04:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:22.550 --> 04:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah I guess there's no real reason
 
04:57:24.890 --> 04:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
for me picking 5A right to marry I have
 
04:57:27.170 --> 04:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
to just made it cleaner uh but yeah if
 
04:57:30.530 --> 04:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
it were to amend article two to add the
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
word marriage after right it's like I
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
guess I would support that as well
 
04:57:37.730 --> 04:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
so it's just a I guess a drafting
 
04:57:39.530 --> 04:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
decision on my behalf that I just
 
04:57:42.170 --> 04:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
thought it was mean that way but um yeah
 
04:57:44.090 --> 04:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
I can to your point of why I should be
 
04:57:46.250 --> 04:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
into and if
 
04:57:48.410 --> 04:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
I could just follow up
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
um uh following the theory of
 
04:57:52.440 --> 04:57:55.550 align:start position:0%
um uh following the theory of
forewarned

04:57:55.550 --> 04:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:55.560 --> 04:57:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:57:57.410 --> 04:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
are you proposing this amendment because
 
04:58:04.970 --> 04:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
of the additional language in Dobbs
 
04:58:07.850 --> 04:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
where one of the justices
 
04:58:10.128 --> 04:58:10.138 align:start position:0%
perhaps a little more enthusiastically
 
04:58:13.448 --> 04:58:13.458 align:start position:0%
than one would hope from a Justice
 
04:58:16.730 --> 04:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
anticipated other areas in which the
 
04:58:19.610 --> 04:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
court might seek to live it
 
04:58:19.620 --> 04:58:20.930 align:start position:0%
court might seek to live it
um

04:58:20.930 --> 04:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
personal rights yeah I think that's the
 
04:58:25.250 --> 04:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
driving point of why it's important to
 
04:58:27.170 --> 04:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
do that now um at the end of the day I'm
 
04:58:28.610 --> 04:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
always in favor of the State
 
04:58:30.530 --> 04:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
Constitution codifying further rights
 
04:58:31.250 --> 04:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
that are also in the Federal
 
04:58:32.510 --> 04:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution so there's no reason we
 
04:58:33.708 --> 04:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
can't do that
 
04:58:35.750 --> 04:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
um because the state constitution could
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
also go beyond and provide additional
 
04:58:39.050 --> 04:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
rates so
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
um yes that is part of the premise like
 
04:58:42.650 --> 04:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
I said I don't think the current Court
 
04:58:44.390 --> 04:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
would do anything but I think it's a
 
04:58:46.490 --> 04:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
good thing to essentially codify
 
04:58:48.288 --> 04:58:48.298 align:start position:0%
something I believe people
 
04:58:50.750 --> 04:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
want and think they have
 
04:58:52.850 --> 04:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:55.310 --> 04:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you all
 
04:58:57.120 --> 04:59:03.410 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you all
right

04:59:03.410 --> 04:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:06.650 --> 04:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
the next bill uh is is we're a little
 
04:59:08.270 --> 04:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
just a couple of minutes early so I
 
04:59:11.150 --> 04:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:13.490 --> 04:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
oh I'm still I'm sorry good point anyone
 
04:59:19.010 --> 04:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:20.750 --> 04:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
therefore I'm going to close the hearing
 
04:59:23.208 --> 04:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
on cacrify thank you
 
04:59:23.218 --> 04:59:26.030 align:start position:0%
on cacrify thank you
um

04:59:26.030 --> 04:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:03.060 --> 05:04:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.610 --> 05:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Ming I know we've
 
05:04:28.270 --> 05:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
spoken on the phone that's right
 
05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
to meet you yes yes uh so my my thoughts
 
05:04:35.090 --> 05:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
are a little a little more prepared and
 
05:04:37.070 --> 05:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
um maybe a little flowery for for this
 
05:04:39.770 --> 05:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
um this situation but I'll start with um
 
05:04:42.650 --> 05:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn Vice chair Wallace and
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
members of the Judiciary Committee my
 
05:04:45.948 --> 05:04:45.958 align:start position:0%
name is Ben Ming I'm a state
 
05:04:47.510 --> 05:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative from Hollis and I am the
 
05:04:50.030 --> 05:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of HB 240 a bill with
 
05:04:52.190 --> 05:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan sponsorship I thank you for
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
the time I have I have before you to
 
05:04:55.788 --> 05:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
introduce what I will refer to as the
 
05:04:58.250 --> 05:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
marital Freedom Act in short this bill
 
05:04:59.930 --> 05:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
seeks to assert the validity of
 
05:05:02.090 --> 05:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
interracial marriage entered into within
 
05:05:03.708 --> 05:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
05:05:05.330 --> 05:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
it is likely that many of you are aware
 
05:05:06.830 --> 05:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the recently passed respect for
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
Marriage Act the federal law that
 
05:05:10.368 --> 05:05:10.378 align:start position:0%
protects same-sex and interracial
 
05:05:10.378 --> 05:05:11.330 align:start position:0%
protects same-sex and interracial
marriages

05:05:11.330 --> 05:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
marriages
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
that law protects the validity of a
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
same-sex or interracial marriage of a
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
couple that as an example is validly
 
05:05:19.850 --> 05:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
married in Maine but now lives in New
 
05:05:19.860 --> 05:05:21.050 align:start position:0%
married in Maine but now lives in New
Hampshire

05:05:21.050 --> 05:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:05:22.670 --> 05:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
the marital Freedom Act seeks to make
 
05:05:25.550 --> 05:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
race a non-factor in determining whether
 
05:05:27.410 --> 05:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
any particular New Hampshire marriage is
 
05:05:27.420 --> 05:05:28.368 align:start position:0%
any particular New Hampshire marriage is
valid

05:05:28.368 --> 05:05:28.378 align:start position:0%
valid
 
05:05:29.650 --> 05:05:29.660 align:start position:0%
on the second generation
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
chinese-american and my wife is a third
 
05:05:33.470 --> 05:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
generation irish-american
 
05:05:35.090 --> 05:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
although this bill matters to me
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
personally I'm here to make the best
 
05:05:39.530 --> 05:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
comprehensive case for this bill and how
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
it helps the state of New Hampshire its
 
05:05:43.368 --> 05:05:43.378 align:start position:0%
citizens and its future
 
05:05:45.770 --> 05:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
we have an aging State and a Workforce
 
05:05:48.288 --> 05:05:48.298 align:start position:0%
that at best is sufficient but tricking
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's no single answer to that problem
 
05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
because younger workers must consider
 
05:05:55.850 --> 05:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
income costs housing and lifestyle in
 
05:05:57.170 --> 05:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
determining where they will raise their
 
05:05:57.180 --> 05:05:58.190 align:start position:0%
determining where they will raise their
families

05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
families
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
increased income can't come with
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
increased costs
 
05:06:03.050 --> 05:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
a family-friendly lifestyle won't matter
 
05:06:05.208 --> 05:06:05.218 align:start position:0%
if there's nowhere to live
 
05:06:06.830 --> 05:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
so we should support growing families
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
and in passing the marital Freedom Act
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
we can take a step towards showing that
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the modern values that
 
05:06:15.470 --> 05:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
will attract and retain the people who
 
05:06:18.050 --> 05:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
will make up our future Workforce
 
05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
we were new englanders and don't take
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
the change easily so I should make the
 
05:06:24.170 --> 05:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
point that supporting modern values
 
05:06:26.090 --> 05:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean leaving behind spirit and
 
05:06:26.100 --> 05:06:27.170 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean leaving behind spirit and
tradition

05:06:27.170 --> 05:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
tradition
 
05:06:28.970 --> 05:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
the core of Granite State values can be
 
05:06:30.650 --> 05:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
seen and how tenaciously we fight for
 
05:06:33.470 --> 05:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
small people focus governance
 
05:06:35.150 --> 05:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
volunteers making important Community
 
05:06:37.550 --> 05:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
decisions on Town boards
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
The Advocate the advocacy for the
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
efficient use of limited funds
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
and a staunch belief that government
 
05:06:45.410 --> 05:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't get a say in what we do that
 
05:06:46.970 --> 05:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect others
 
05:06:49.550 --> 05:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
in other words our rights of privacy
 
05:06:51.650 --> 05:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
marriage and interracial marriage in
 
05:06:53.570 --> 05:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
particular is one of those rights of
 
05:06:53.580 --> 05:06:54.830 align:start position:0%
particular is one of those rights of
privacy

05:06:54.830 --> 05:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
05:06:56.090 --> 05:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
there are currently no New Hampshire
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
laws that address interracial marriage
 
05:07:01.610 --> 05:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
but absence is no indication of security
 
05:07:03.230 --> 05:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
the diminishing public respect for
 
05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
governmental institutions and traditions
 
05:07:07.128 --> 05:07:07.138 align:start position:0%
is a clear and growing problem
 
05:07:09.350 --> 05:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
therefore we must be clear about the
 
05:07:11.208 --> 05:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
values that we share
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 240 the marital Freedom Act
 
05:07:16.010 --> 05:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
asserts an important component of our
 
05:07:18.170 --> 05:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
Collective rights of privacy and I ask
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
that you support its passage into law
 
05:07:23.330 --> 05:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and um I I would like to go on
 
05:07:25.368 --> 05:07:25.378 align:start position:0%
the record that I would probably support
 
05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
um representative heinz's
 
05:07:29.750 --> 05:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
um Constitutional Amendment and um
 
05:07:31.670 --> 05:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it to you great thank you uh
 
05:07:33.890 --> 05:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
05:07:36.590 --> 05:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh Manos good
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh Ben I wanted to know
 
05:07:43.490 --> 05:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
um the um the bill says the actual take
 
05:07:46.310 --> 05:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after its passage and I'm
 
05:07:49.010 --> 05:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh wondering whether you would be
 
05:07:50.570 --> 05:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
willing to amend it so that it takes
 
05:07:52.970 --> 05:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
effect immediately after its passage I'd
 
05:07:55.490 --> 05:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
be very open to that thank you other
 
05:07:57.170 --> 05:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes representative
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Matt um Mr chair not
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
Madam chair um and thank you for taking
 
05:08:02.570 --> 05:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:08:05.390 --> 05:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
um are there like specific examples of
 
05:08:06.890 --> 05:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire infringing on the right to
 
05:08:08.448 --> 05:08:08.458 align:start position:0%
marry for anybody
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
sent like in recent memory since Supreme
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
Court of burgerfeld's decision
 
05:08:15.948 --> 05:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
um so I asked OLS to to dig into
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriages
 
05:08:19.610 --> 05:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
um it goes back almost 30 years and
 
05:08:22.010 --> 05:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of back and forth
 
05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
um many of those bills did not pass
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
um the ones that would seek to take away
 
05:08:29.930 --> 05:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriages
 
05:08:31.730 --> 05:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
um and as for interracial marriage like
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
I said before uh I haven't seen anything
 
05:08:38.448 --> 05:08:38.458 align:start position:0%
so outside of outside of that no
 
05:08:39.770 --> 05:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness so
 
05:08:44.448 --> 05:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
representative can I just can I just ask
 
05:08:46.250 --> 05:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
them if
 
05:08:46.260 --> 05:08:47.868 align:start position:0%
them if
the

05:08:47.868 --> 05:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the uh from the from
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
the bill as drafted the the language
 
05:08:56.990 --> 05:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
that this that your bill would add to
 
05:08:58.550 --> 05:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
05:09:01.910 --> 05:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
is basically adding the words or race is
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
that correct that is right all right so
 
05:09:07.490 --> 05:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
I and I guess my question is if they're
 
05:09:07.500 --> 05:09:10.628 align:start position:0%
I and I guess my question is if they're
um

05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
why is this bill necessary I guess
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
really is the question if there I mean
 
05:09:16.670 --> 05:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
it I
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
um in fact even Justice is taught
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
Justice Thomas's uh uh concurring
 
05:09:27.050 --> 05:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
opinion in the uh in in the case that oh
 
05:09:28.670 --> 05:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
what I forgot the name of the case even
 
05:09:31.850 --> 05:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
now the ones yeah Dobbs it it didn't
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
suggest that uh loving could be
 
05:09:36.890 --> 05:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
overruled because that's based on the
 
05:09:39.170 --> 05:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
14th Amendment that's based on the uh
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
racial discrimination
 
05:09:43.850 --> 05:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
um so the fourth you know the core of
 
05:09:47.708 --> 05:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
the 14th Amendment so where is the
 
05:09:51.650 --> 05:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
where is the risk of you know somebody
 
05:09:53.810 --> 05:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
saying there cannot you know interracial
 
05:09:56.628 --> 05:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
marriage is is in jeopardy
 
05:09:58.010 --> 05:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
05:10:00.650 --> 05:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
um this is definitely more of a planning
 
05:10:02.810 --> 05:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
type type law there's no there's no
 
05:10:04.550 --> 05:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
burning fire
 
05:10:07.368 --> 05:10:07.378 align:start position:0%
um and all due respect to Justice Thomas
 
05:10:11.448 --> 05:10:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:13.730 --> 05:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
other I'm I'm sorry other yes
 
05:10:16.490 --> 05:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
05:10:16.500 --> 05:10:17.590 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
um

05:10:17.590 --> 05:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:20.288 --> 05:10:20.298 align:start position:0%
representative Ming I I certainly
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
sympathize with your last comment
 
05:10:25.430 --> 05:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
although it's probably not appropriate
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
to say it publicly but there's a very
 
05:10:32.030 --> 05:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
real and personal reason why we know
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
that representative Thomas will not be
 
05:10:39.368 --> 05:10:39.378 align:start position:0%
involved in any measure to declare
 
05:10:42.650 --> 05:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional a marriage between two
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
people of different races
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
is that not so
 
05:10:49.010 --> 05:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure I understand your
 
05:10:49.020 --> 05:10:53.448 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure I understand your
question

05:10:53.448 --> 05:10:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:53.458 --> 05:10:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:55.850 --> 05:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you and you have every right to
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
say that
 
05:11:00.170 --> 05:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
um the reason I say that is because
 
05:11:02.690 --> 05:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
um Justice Thomas has been involved in a
 
05:11:04.730 --> 05:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
long and apparently very close and
 
05:11:08.030 --> 05:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
successful marriage with a woman of A
 
05:11:09.410 --> 05:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
different race
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so he would be in a very difficult
 
05:11:15.410 --> 05:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
position to lead
 
05:11:19.448 --> 05:11:19.458 align:start position:0%
the fight to eliminate interracial
 
05:11:19.458 --> 05:11:21.230 align:start position:0%
the fight to eliminate interracial
marriage

05:11:21.230 --> 05:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
05:11:26.090 --> 05:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
do you think that by adding race
 
05:11:28.910 --> 05:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
and not other
 
05:11:28.920 --> 05:11:31.128 align:start position:0%
and not other
categories

05:11:31.128 --> 05:11:31.138 align:start position:0%
categories
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
religion for example that you might be
 
05:11:37.368 --> 05:11:37.378 align:start position:0%
undermining the efforts to make sure
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
that everyone's right
 
05:11:43.610 --> 05:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
to marry the person of his or her choice
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
is guaranteed
 
05:11:48.650 --> 05:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
05:11:48.660 --> 05:11:49.250 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
um

05:11:49.250 --> 05:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:52.010 --> 05:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
we have protected classes for a reason
 
05:11:55.550 --> 05:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
those are explicit in my opinion and um
 
05:11:57.770 --> 05:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
this is one this is one area that I
 
05:12:02.570 --> 05:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:03.530 --> 05:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
let's ask one other question
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
representing and that that is this and I
 
05:12:07.788 --> 05:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
want to say this in the most respectful
 
05:12:11.448 --> 05:12:11.458 align:start position:0%
way possible but if the
 
05:12:14.448 --> 05:12:14.458 align:start position:0%
If there really isn't a one one of the
 
05:12:15.770 --> 05:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
things that concerns me frankly about
 
05:12:18.770 --> 05:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
this measures this if there really isn't
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
a realistic problem
 
05:12:24.170 --> 05:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
that needs to be solved one of the
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
things that would concern me and I'll
 
05:12:27.650 --> 05:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
frankly say it's sort of it's sort of a
 
05:12:30.470 --> 05:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
political thing is if the legislature
 
05:12:33.170 --> 05:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
were to pass this law
 
05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
would there then be you know would would
 
05:12:38.930 --> 05:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
people be saying you see we had to pass
 
05:12:41.030 --> 05:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
this law because there really was a
 
05:12:41.040 --> 05:12:42.708 align:start position:0%
this law because there really was a
threat

05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
threat
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
um and that's why and you know that sort
 
05:12:48.288 --> 05:12:48.298 align:start position:0%
of shows that uh you know one political
 
05:12:51.050 --> 05:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
party or the other was really uh there
 
05:12:53.090 --> 05:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
you know we really can't trust them that
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
would be one of the things that would
 
05:12:58.490 --> 05:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
concern me frankly uh where there really
 
05:13:00.890 --> 05:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
isn't at least as I sort of see it I
 
05:13:03.230 --> 05:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't see a problem of you know any
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
Potential Threat uh that that uh
 
05:13:09.230 --> 05:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
interracial marriage is likely in any
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
kind of Jeopardy
 
05:13:13.368 --> 05:13:13.378 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question could you
 
05:13:16.430 --> 05:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
maybe clarify what you mean by threat um
 
05:13:18.590 --> 05:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:13:20.750 --> 05:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
the part where you said we were forced
 
05:13:23.930 --> 05:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill because
 
05:13:25.910 --> 05:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
right now in other words what I would be
 
05:13:28.430 --> 05:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about if we were to pass this
 
05:13:31.010 --> 05:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
bill is that
 
05:13:34.490 --> 05:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
it it could it could generate an
 
05:13:38.690 --> 05:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
argument or a claim by which I I tend to
 
05:13:40.970 --> 05:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
think would would not be would not sort
 
05:13:41.948 --> 05:13:41.958 align:start position:0%
of help
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
uh bipartisanship by one side against
 
05:13:48.050 --> 05:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
the other that you see we really needed
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
we needed to pass this bill because
 
05:13:54.050 --> 05:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
there really is a threat
 
05:13:56.930 --> 05:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
to interracial marriage
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
when you know it doesn't seem to me that
 
05:14:02.208 --> 05:14:02.218 align:start position:0%
there really is a threat to interracial
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
marriage that that would be my part of
 
05:14:06.590 --> 05:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
my concern I mean being very candid with
 
05:14:09.170 --> 05:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
you about it thank you um
 
05:14:09.180 --> 05:14:10.970 align:start position:0%
you about it thank you um
um

05:14:10.970 --> 05:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:12.410 --> 05:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
like I said at the top that says
 
05:14:15.350 --> 05:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
bipartisan sponsorship and
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
uh from my side of the aisle I don't see
 
05:14:22.128 --> 05:14:22.138 align:start position:0%
this being a political party
 
05:14:24.830 --> 05:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see this being a partisan issue
 
05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay there are like like was mentioned
 
05:14:27.360 --> 05:14:28.190 align:start position:0%
okay there are like like was mentioned
earlier

05:14:28.190 --> 05:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
05:14:30.110 --> 05:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of people on both sides
 
05:14:32.570 --> 05:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
of the aisle both locally here and at
 
05:14:34.128 --> 05:14:34.138 align:start position:0%
the federal government that are in
 
05:14:35.930 --> 05:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
interracial marriages
 
05:14:35.940 --> 05:14:38.270 align:start position:0%
interracial marriages
and

05:14:38.270 --> 05:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:38.280 --> 05:14:39.410 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:14:39.410 --> 05:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
I don't see this as a political thing
 
05:14:45.050 --> 05:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
but I I do feel it's important
 
05:14:45.060 --> 05:14:47.150 align:start position:0%
but I I do feel it's important
um

05:14:47.150 --> 05:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:49.208 --> 05:14:49.218 align:start position:0%
in my remarks earlier
 
05:14:52.490 --> 05:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
that this is a signal to show that New
 
05:14:55.490 --> 05:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire isn't completely backwards
 
05:14:59.208 --> 05:14:59.218 align:start position:0%
this is important to show people that
 
05:15:02.270 --> 05:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
are growing up in a more
 
05:15:06.530 --> 05:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:06.540 --> 05:15:07.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:15:07.788 --> 05:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
we're diversifying in the United States
 
05:15:11.690 --> 05:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
and I don't want New Hampshire to fall
 
05:15:11.700 --> 05:15:12.830 align:start position:0%
and I don't want New Hampshire to fall
back

05:15:12.830 --> 05:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:15:16.788 --> 05:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:19.128 --> 05:15:19.138 align:start position:0%
okay but you know just your answer that
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
you just gave to you see my concern when
 
05:15:22.550 --> 05:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
you say that New Hampshire we want to
 
05:15:24.288 --> 05:15:24.298 align:start position:0%
show that New Hampshire is not a
 
05:15:25.788 --> 05:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
completely backward
 
05:15:25.798 --> 05:15:27.288 align:start position:0%
completely backward
Society

05:15:27.288 --> 05:15:27.298 align:start position:0%
Society
 
05:15:28.550 --> 05:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
05:15:30.650 --> 05:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
that sort of makes my point I think the
 
05:15:33.530 --> 05:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
suggestion was we needed this because
 
05:15:35.868 --> 05:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire really is a a totally
 
05:15:38.448 --> 05:15:38.458 align:start position:0%
backward society and this will correct
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
it and you know for I think for those of
 
05:15:43.730 --> 05:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
us including myself who don't think New
 
05:15:45.470 --> 05:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a particularly backward
 
05:15:45.480 --> 05:15:47.150 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a particularly backward
Society

05:15:47.150 --> 05:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
Society
 
05:15:47.160 --> 05:15:48.288 align:start position:0%
Society
um

05:15:48.288 --> 05:15:48.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:51.250 --> 05:15:51.260 align:start position:0%
your answer sort of makes my point
 
05:15:53.090 --> 05:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
respectfully thank you for the question
 
05:15:56.810 --> 05:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
and respectfully I we we obviously did
 
05:15:59.930 --> 05:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
not grow up in similar situations right
 
05:16:02.690 --> 05:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
we're we're of different races and we
 
05:16:02.700 --> 05:16:03.410 align:start position:0%
we're we're of different races and we
have

05:16:03.410 --> 05:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:16:06.050 --> 05:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
um different different backgrounds
 
05:16:08.030 --> 05:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I grew up in the Greater Boston area
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
so I was very close to New Hampshire and
 
05:16:10.920 --> 05:16:12.288 align:start position:0%
so I was very close to New Hampshire and
um

05:16:12.288 --> 05:16:12.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:15.170 --> 05:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
for someone that is not white race is
 
05:16:18.830 --> 05:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:21.170 --> 05:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
other yes representative representative
 
05:16:21.180 --> 05:16:22.070 align:start position:0%
other yes representative representative
Perez

05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
Perez
 
05:16:24.110 --> 05:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:16:25.730 --> 05:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
you know there's two ways to look at
 
05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
this one way to look at it if it's not
 
05:16:27.958 --> 05:16:29.690 align:start position:0%
this one way to look at it if it's not
broken

05:16:29.690 --> 05:16:29.700 align:start position:0%
broken
 
05:16:31.368 --> 05:16:31.378 align:start position:0%
don't fix it
 
05:16:33.410 --> 05:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
the other way to look at it is being
 
05:16:33.420 --> 05:16:35.750 align:start position:0%
the other way to look at it is being
proactive

05:16:35.750 --> 05:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
proactive
 
05:16:38.330 --> 05:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm very new at this but I have
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
become very aware of what people think
 
05:16:46.190 --> 05:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
of what goes on in here outside of here
 
05:16:49.010 --> 05:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example A couple of
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
years ago when the freedom fetal Act was
 
05:16:55.850 --> 05:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
passed people said why are they wasting
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
their time with that people people don't
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
have abortions in New Hampshire over 24
 
05:17:03.050 --> 05:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:06.890 --> 05:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid that people if if we
 
05:17:08.990 --> 05:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
I understand being proactive and I'm
 
05:17:09.000 --> 05:17:10.010 align:start position:0%
I understand being proactive and I'm
older

05:17:10.010 --> 05:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
older
 
05:17:13.730 --> 05:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
but at the same token I don't want and I
 
05:17:16.190 --> 05:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
think perception is huge
 
05:17:18.948 --> 05:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
I don't want people to think that
 
05:17:20.750 --> 05:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
is this what they think is important
 
05:17:22.810 --> 05:17:22.820 align:start position:0%
there's not a problem here
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
why are we making this a priority and
 
05:17:28.368 --> 05:17:28.378 align:start position:0%
it's not to undermine your feelings at
 
05:17:30.110 --> 05:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
all you know
 
05:17:30.120 --> 05:17:30.650 align:start position:0%
all you know
um

05:17:30.650 --> 05:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:32.570 --> 05:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
my parents when they came from Italy
 
05:17:34.250 --> 05:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
were in New York where the signs all
 
05:17:36.948 --> 05:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
said if Italian do not apply
 
05:17:40.670 --> 05:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
so I understand that but we don't have
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
that a problem we don't have a sign that
 
05:17:46.730 --> 05:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
says if you're you can't have a biracial
 
05:17:46.740 --> 05:17:47.690 align:start position:0%
says if you're you can't have a biracial
marriage

05:17:47.690 --> 05:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
05:17:50.448 --> 05:17:50.458 align:start position:0%
okay does that make sense
 
05:17:53.750 --> 05:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense thank you
 
05:18:01.610 --> 05:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:04.850 --> 05:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
I sort of take offense at this I have a
 
05:18:04.860 --> 05:18:06.470 align:start position:0%
I sort of take offense at this I have a
wife

05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
wife
 
05:18:08.750 --> 05:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
who is Japanese
 
05:18:08.760 --> 05:18:10.368 align:start position:0%
who is Japanese
uh

05:18:10.368 --> 05:18:10.378 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:12.708 --> 05:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
I don't think about it
 
05:18:15.170 --> 05:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
until I hear something like this law
 
05:18:16.990 --> 05:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
being proposed
 
05:18:20.448 --> 05:18:20.458 align:start position:0%
and my wife to my knowledge doesn't
 
05:18:22.010 --> 05:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
think about it either
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
I sort of take offense at this kind of a
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:31.680 --> 05:18:33.050 align:start position:0%
 
other

05:18:33.050 --> 05:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tripp

thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:18:40.190 --> 05:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
I really don't have much to say about
 
05:18:45.770 --> 05:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
the the raised part of this bill but uh
 
05:18:45.780 --> 05:18:47.030 align:start position:0%
the the raised part of this bill but uh
uh

05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:49.490 --> 05:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
there was uh there's some other wording
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
in the bill that caught my eye
 
05:18:54.350 --> 05:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
and it said that uh
 
05:18:56.750 --> 05:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
any person who otherwise meets the
 
05:18:59.330 --> 05:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements
 
05:19:01.850 --> 05:19:01.860 align:start position:0%

requirements that uh might we might want
 
05:19:15.170 --> 05:19:15.180 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is is add it adds
 
05:19:29.270 --> 05:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
race to the component of the RSA that
 
05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%

and if there's other issues that uh need
 
05:19:53.150 --> 05:19:53.160 align:start position:0%

foreign
 
05:20:04.430 --> 05:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
thanks uh for taking the questions
 
05:20:07.490 --> 05:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
um going to the point of whether or not
 
05:20:10.128 --> 05:20:10.138 align:start position:0%
this is needed preemptively whether this
 
05:20:11.750 --> 05:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
is addressed as a current problem or not
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
are you aware of other states that
 
05:20:17.628 --> 05:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
include uh the term race in their
 
05:20:19.970 --> 05:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
um in their marriage statutes or or
 
05:20:22.128 --> 05:20:22.138 align:start position:0%
Constitution all right thank you thank
 
05:20:23.448 --> 05:20:23.458 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
05:20:25.430 --> 05:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of that
 
05:20:25.440 --> 05:20:26.270 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of that
um

05:20:26.270 --> 05:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:28.788 --> 05:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of what
 
05:20:31.010 --> 05:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
instigated this bill was
 
05:20:33.830 --> 05:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
there was the fall of Roe versus Wade
 
05:20:35.570 --> 05:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
and I I believe that to be its own
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
separate issue um in terms of Rights of
 
05:20:40.430 --> 05:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
privacy and
 
05:20:40.440 --> 05:20:42.530 align:start position:0%
privacy and
um

05:20:42.530 --> 05:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:45.770 --> 05:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
but it it did wake wake me up and wake
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
other people up in terms of
 
05:20:53.628 --> 05:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:53.638 --> 05:20:56.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:20:56.330 --> 05:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:59.628 --> 05:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
again it is I I do appreciate this is
 
05:20:59.638 --> 05:21:00.410 align:start position:0%
again it is I I do appreciate this is
not

05:21:00.410 --> 05:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
directly at you
 
05:21:04.368 --> 05:21:04.378 align:start position:0%
um but I do appreciate that it is
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to understand
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
what it's like to grow up non-white and
 
05:21:11.628 --> 05:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
the types of protections that we feel
 
05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
that we need
 
05:21:15.470 --> 05:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
now just one quick follow-up yes
 
05:21:18.410 --> 05:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
um I I I totally respect that and I I I
 
05:21:22.128 --> 05:21:22.138 align:start position:0%
I I can see the value with this but um I
 
05:21:23.330 --> 05:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
guess what I was just trying to draw out
 
05:21:26.810 --> 05:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
was whether or not we would be unique in
 
05:21:29.208 --> 05:21:29.218 align:start position:0%
that regard and I guess also since you
 
05:21:32.570 --> 05:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the point of privacy uh
 
05:21:34.850 --> 05:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
the other Provisions that were in the
 
05:21:36.890 --> 05:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
Dobbs uh
 
05:21:41.030 --> 05:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
um language from the uh the Justice
 
05:21:43.850 --> 05:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
um they is it correct that they all did
 
05:21:46.730 --> 05:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
sort of focus on the right to privacy
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
provisions and the decisions based on
 
05:21:51.910 --> 05:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
privacy even though they didn't
 
05:21:54.708 --> 05:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
explicitly mentioned interracial
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
marriage but several others that that my
 
05:21:58.670 --> 05:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
understanding was are based on the right
 
05:22:01.250 --> 05:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
to privacy is that right
 
05:22:03.288 --> 05:22:03.298 align:start position:0%
um I I don't recall
 
05:22:05.390 --> 05:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
um if that if that is the case but it
 
05:22:07.550 --> 05:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
was things like um Family Planning I
 
05:22:07.560 --> 05:22:08.628 align:start position:0%
was things like um Family Planning I
believe

05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:22:08.638 --> 05:22:10.368 align:start position:0%
believe
um

05:22:10.368 --> 05:22:10.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:10.378 --> 05:22:12.470 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:14.570 --> 05:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what what was the what was
 
05:22:15.948 --> 05:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
the um connection that you were trying
 
05:22:17.628 --> 05:22:17.638 align:start position:0%
to make
 
05:22:19.670 --> 05:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
with with your question
 
05:22:22.368 --> 05:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
just whether any
 
05:22:25.190 --> 05:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
um marriage provision tied to the right
 
05:22:27.948 --> 05:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
to privacy is more or less under some
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
form of threat because of the way that
 
05:22:32.628 --> 05:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
that was worded
 
05:22:37.010 --> 05:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:39.530 --> 05:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
05:22:39.540 --> 05:22:40.250 align:start position:0%
I believe
um

05:22:40.250 --> 05:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:43.910 --> 05:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:46.368 --> 05:22:46.378 align:start position:0%
yeah other questions for this witness
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative great
 
05:22:54.288 --> 05:22:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:56.930 --> 05:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hines
 
05:23:00.050 --> 05:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
or damn Mr hi Jess thank you I think
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'll be quick I was trying to address a
 
05:23:04.250 --> 05:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
couple questions uh I guess I agree at
 
05:23:06.170 --> 05:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
the Lee at the moment there's no legal
 
05:23:08.868 --> 05:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
need for this but I think it is symbolic
 
05:23:11.570 --> 05:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
um legislature does do symbolic things
 
05:23:14.208 --> 05:23:14.218 align:start position:0%
um so when we vote to send a message to
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government about whether we
 
05:23:18.170 --> 05:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
disapprove of something or whether we
 
05:23:20.150 --> 05:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
name a bridge after someone in some
 
05:23:22.310 --> 05:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
honorific manner um those don't really
 
05:23:24.410 --> 05:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
have legal consequences but I think
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
there's a benefit to gain from that I
 
05:23:28.128 --> 05:23:28.138 align:start position:0%
just don't I guess I don't personally
 
05:23:30.050 --> 05:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
see the harm in doing this
 
05:23:33.050 --> 05:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and I think we do enact laws that
 
05:23:35.208 --> 05:23:35.218 align:start position:0%
um might not be needed just to clarify
 
05:23:37.128 --> 05:23:37.138 align:start position:0%
so while we have a constitutional right
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
to privacy we often adopt laws that's
 
05:23:42.650 --> 05:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
incorporate from legislative standpoint
 
05:23:44.090 --> 05:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
what that means
 
05:23:45.410 --> 05:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
um so I'm happy to take any questions
 
05:23:47.150 --> 05:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to address some
 
05:23:49.128 --> 05:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander thank you
 
05:23:53.390 --> 05:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative so
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
um with following on that um thought
 
05:23:57.288 --> 05:23:57.298 align:start position:0%
process would you be amenable with
 
05:23:59.330 --> 05:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
amending to add every single protected
 
05:24:02.208 --> 05:24:02.218 align:start position:0%
class in here so that next session we
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody coming in asking to
 
05:24:06.590 --> 05:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
add ethnicity or religion or something
 
05:24:08.030 --> 05:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
else for instance
 
05:24:09.350 --> 05:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's not my bill so I want to speak for
 
05:24:12.770 --> 05:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
the sponsor I think uh classes that this
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
committee feels are important to protect
 
05:24:16.368 --> 05:24:16.378 align:start position:0%
to one ad I personally don't have any
 
05:24:19.690 --> 05:24:19.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
other questions for uh yes uh
 
05:24:25.010 --> 05:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo
 
05:24:26.270 --> 05:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:24:28.430 --> 05:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative Heinz so we're talking
 
05:24:30.830 --> 05:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
about a cacr you know and we talked
 
05:24:34.690 --> 05:24:34.700 align:start position:0%
about ceremonial or whatever
 
05:24:39.650 --> 05:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
this is the bill oh yeah yeah
 
05:24:39.660 --> 05:24:40.250 align:start position:0%
this is the bill oh yeah yeah
um

05:24:40.250 --> 05:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
makes sense to just have a house
 
05:24:44.510 --> 05:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
continue a resolution about
 
05:24:47.690 --> 05:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
um you know the right to marry and
 
05:24:49.730 --> 05:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
including all the little you know all
 
05:24:53.330 --> 05:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
the different categories of people uh I
 
05:24:54.650 --> 05:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
think in the immediate time frame they
 
05:24:56.750 --> 05:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
would essentially serve the same purpose
 
05:24:58.788 --> 05:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
um if we are trying to to I guess
 
05:25:01.368 --> 05:25:01.378 align:start position:0%
prevent or somehow influence future
 
05:25:03.470 --> 05:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
conduct and suggest amending the law it
 
05:25:05.090 --> 05:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
does go further than that but I would
 
05:25:07.788 --> 05:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
also support what you're suggesting
 
05:25:10.010 --> 05:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
05:25:12.948 --> 05:25:12.958 align:start position:0%

05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
Windham
 
05:33:27.650 --> 05:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
um and I'm uh
 
05:33:30.830 --> 05:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
I've I've like to testify in support of
 
05:33:32.930 --> 05:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
this bill which proposes a
 
05:33:34.550 --> 05:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
05:33:37.368 --> 05:33:37.378 align:start position:0%
to raise the retirement age for all
 
05:33:42.050 --> 05:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
judges in the state from 70 to 75.
 
05:33:46.550 --> 05:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
um the the age 70 limit has been in the
 
05:33:48.230 --> 05:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
constitution of New Hampshire from the
 
05:33:51.288 --> 05:33:51.298 align:start position:0%
beginning from 1784 when the
 
05:33:54.830 --> 05:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution was first adopted
 
05:33:58.128 --> 05:33:58.138 align:start position:0%
um at that time the average longevity
 
05:34:00.708 --> 05:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
was in the early 60s I believe maybe
 
05:34:02.090 --> 05:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
even a little less than that but the
 
05:34:05.090 --> 05:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
early but at the early 60s at the latest
 
05:34:07.850 --> 05:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
so a constitutional provision that says
 
05:34:12.050 --> 05:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
judges can't serve uh Beyond 70 didn't
 
05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
have much practical effect but now it it
 
05:34:17.448 --> 05:34:17.458 align:start position:0%
really does
 
05:34:17.458 --> 05:34:19.208 align:start position:0%
really does
um

05:34:19.208 --> 05:34:19.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:23.090 --> 05:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
there are a number of states around the
 
05:34:26.330 --> 05:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
country that do have age limits and 70
 
05:34:29.330 --> 05:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
is often the age that uh you know that
 
05:34:30.590 --> 05:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:34:32.930 --> 05:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh that applies I mean I know you know I
 
05:34:34.070 --> 05:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
come from Connecticut originally
 
05:34:39.288 --> 05:34:39.298 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has a an age 70 uh limit
 
05:34:39.298 --> 05:34:39.948 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has a an age 70 uh limit
um

05:34:39.948 --> 05:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh I believe Ohio which uh Connecticut
 
05:34:45.708 --> 05:34:45.718 align:start position:0%
does not elect judges similar to New
 
05:34:45.718 --> 05:34:46.970 align:start position:0%
does not elect judges similar to New
Hampshire

05:34:46.970 --> 05:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:34:46.980 --> 05:34:47.770 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

05:34:47.770 --> 05:34:47.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:51.050 --> 05:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh I believe Ohio as another example
 
05:34:53.410 --> 05:34:53.420 align:start position:0%
which does elect judges they also have
 
05:34:57.948 --> 05:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
uh an age 70 limit although I as I
 
05:34:59.628 --> 05:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
understand as an example the way Ohio
 
05:35:03.288 --> 05:35:03.298 align:start position:0%
law works is if you are you can stand
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
for election and I think Ohio Judges are
 
05:35:08.810 --> 05:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
elected for six-year terms I believe if
 
05:35:10.910 --> 05:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
you can stand for election if you're
 
05:35:13.430 --> 05:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
under 70 and serve out your term even if
 
05:35:15.770 --> 05:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
you go over 70 but you can't re you
 
05:35:18.230 --> 05:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
can't run again if you're if you're over
 
05:35:20.170 --> 05:35:20.180 align:start position:0%
70. and different states have different
 
05:35:23.628 --> 05:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh different laws uh Rhode Island as an
 
05:35:26.948 --> 05:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
example does not have any uh age limit
 
05:35:30.610 --> 05:35:30.620 align:start position:0%
Vermont has an age limit of 90.
 
05:35:33.830 --> 05:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
and as you probably all know the the uh
 
05:35:35.628 --> 05:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
the Federal Government Federal Judges
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
are not subject to any age limit I I
 
05:35:40.490 --> 05:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
have to say that
 
05:35:43.970 --> 05:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
um I I think that there should be an age
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
limit so I'm I wouldn't be one I would
 
05:35:48.650 --> 05:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
not be here advocating to not have any
 
05:35:50.868 --> 05:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
age limit at all I think there should be
 
05:35:52.368 --> 05:35:52.378 align:start position:0%
an age limit
 
05:35:55.010 --> 05:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
um and I also kind of believe in you
 
05:35:57.470 --> 05:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
know trying to do what what seems to be
 
05:35:57.480 --> 05:35:59.030 align:start position:0%
know trying to do what what seems to be
realistic

05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
realistic
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
um it might be I I think I you know if I
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
had my druthers I I might say that maybe
 
05:36:05.570 --> 05:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
the age limit should be 80 or as opposed
 
05:36:07.910 --> 05:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
to 75 but
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm I I want to try to do
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
what I what I hope this committee and
 
05:36:14.990 --> 05:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
the full legislature and the people uh
 
05:36:17.208 --> 05:36:17.218 align:start position:0%
will think is is a is reasonable and I'm
 
05:36:19.490 --> 05:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
sort of an incrementalist if it you know
 
05:36:23.330 --> 05:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
if if we were if we'd were to pass a uh
 
05:36:24.770 --> 05:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment that raise the
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
age to 75 and if we had it in effect for
 
05:36:30.110 --> 05:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know 10 or 15 years and it seemed to
 
05:36:31.550 --> 05:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
be working well then maybe it would be
 
05:36:33.410 --> 05:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
time to consider raising the age limit
 
05:36:35.570 --> 05:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
to 80. on the other hand if it turned
 
05:36:37.670 --> 05:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
out we had a you know a bunch of people
 
05:36:40.910 --> 05:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
that were uh dribbling on the bench uh
 
05:36:45.288 --> 05:36:45.298 align:start position:0%
you know at uh at 74.75 uh then we maybe
 
05:36:47.448 --> 05:36:47.458 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to rethink it and go the
 
05:36:50.868 --> 05:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
other way I I feel very confident that
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
that scenario would not happen but
 
05:36:55.670 --> 05:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
um I do you know I think it it makes
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
sense to kind of go uh step by step
 
05:37:03.530 --> 05:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would say we I bear in mind
 
05:37:03.540 --> 05:37:04.970 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would say we I bear in mind
that

05:37:04.970 --> 05:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:37:09.310 --> 05:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
judges are generally
 
05:37:11.750 --> 05:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
judging is generally something that is
 
05:37:13.090 --> 05:37:13.100 align:start position:0%
done by
 
05:37:16.010 --> 05:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking mature mature people
 
05:37:19.010 --> 05:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
in other words I I would say that the
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
average age of a job when a judge is
 
05:37:24.110 --> 05:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
first appointed is probably runs from
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
the mid 40s to early 50s uh generally
 
05:37:30.650 --> 05:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
that you know you don't you don't people
 
05:37:33.650 --> 05:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
don't generally become judges at 25 or
 
05:37:35.150 --> 05:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
30 years old
 
05:37:36.708 --> 05:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
um it just it just really doesn't happen
 
05:37:38.868 --> 05:37:38.878 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:37:43.850 --> 05:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
um they often judges want to serve uh
 
05:37:46.128 --> 05:37:46.138 align:start position:0%
Beyond 70. I know I mean I Frank Frankly
 
05:37:48.590 --> 05:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
if you know if I if if I didn't have to
 
05:37:50.628 --> 05:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
retire that's where I'd still be I'd
 
05:37:52.550 --> 05:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
still be over at the over at the Supreme
 
05:37:55.850 --> 05:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
Court and I know some you know deer a
 
05:37:57.948 --> 05:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
very dear colleague of mine judge Convoy
 
05:38:00.110 --> 05:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
felt this feels the same felt the same
 
05:38:02.868 --> 05:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
way I mean she she absolutely and there
 
05:38:04.270 --> 05:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
was absolutely
 
05:38:07.850 --> 05:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh no reason for her to retire she's and
 
05:38:09.770 --> 05:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
she's as sharp now as she ever was and
 
05:38:12.350 --> 05:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
she was always very very sharp I hope
 
05:38:14.570 --> 05:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
that I haven't you know I know I've lost
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
a step or two physically that that's for
 
05:38:19.970 --> 05:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
sure I mentioned that my uh I think I do
 
05:38:22.128 --> 05:38:22.138 align:start position:0%
in our introductory section session I
 
05:38:23.330 --> 05:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned that my hobby was target
 
05:38:26.510 --> 05:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
shooting I used to be really good a
 
05:38:28.250 --> 05:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
really good Target shooter
 
05:38:31.250 --> 05:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
um I can still do all right but uh you
 
05:38:34.010 --> 05:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
know age has definitely uh I can't hold
 
05:38:35.690 --> 05:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
the ten ring like I used to be able to
 
05:38:38.208 --> 05:38:38.218 align:start position:0%
hold a 10 Ring that's for sure but but
 
05:38:40.490 --> 05:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
mentally I think I've still got
 
05:38:43.128 --> 05:38:43.138 align:start position:0%
um got my faculties and and would still
 
05:38:45.288 --> 05:38:45.298 align:start position:0%
be able to do a good job
 
05:38:47.448 --> 05:38:47.458 align:start position:0%
um as a judge
 
05:38:49.970 --> 05:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
um Beyond you know at beyond the age of
 
05:38:52.850 --> 05:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
70. I I should know just to so that the
 
05:38:54.770 --> 05:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
because I know that I've heard some
 
05:38:56.690 --> 05:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
comments from this committee but just in
 
05:38:59.830 --> 05:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
common I should note so it's very clear
 
05:39:03.230 --> 05:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
this proposed Constitutional Amendment
 
05:39:05.448 --> 05:39:05.458 align:start position:0%
even if it were enacted would have
 
05:39:08.390 --> 05:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely no retroactive effect so that
 
05:39:11.810 --> 05:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm already retired and you know
 
05:39:13.850 --> 05:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
that would not apply to me judge Conboy
 
05:39:15.708 --> 05:39:15.718 align:start position:0%
actually I'm I mean it would not apply
 
05:39:17.868 --> 05:39:17.878 align:start position:0%
to her either in fact she's she turned
 
05:39:20.150 --> 05:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
75 this summer so it wouldn't apply to
 
05:39:22.788 --> 05:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
her either but it would apply to judges
 
05:39:24.230 --> 05:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
that are still on the bench and are
 
05:39:26.930 --> 05:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
still and are still active and I I have
 
05:39:28.310 --> 05:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
to say
 
05:39:33.050 --> 05:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
we have I think an extraordinarily good
 
05:39:35.448 --> 05:39:35.458 align:start position:0%
Judiciary in the state particularly now
 
05:39:37.490 --> 05:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
and that includes people that have been
 
05:39:39.230 --> 05:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
appointed to the bench by both
 
05:39:42.110 --> 05:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
Republican and Democratic Governors um I
 
05:39:45.050 --> 05:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
think we really can be very proud of the
 
05:39:47.330 --> 05:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
judges we have in New Hampshire that are
 
05:39:49.850 --> 05:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
currently on the bench and you know I I
 
05:39:52.730 --> 05:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
think it would I think that we the state
 
05:39:54.650 --> 05:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
would greatly benefit from from
 
05:39:56.930 --> 05:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
permitting those judges that want to
 
05:39:59.810 --> 05:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
stay Beyond age 70 for up to another up
 
05:40:04.010 --> 05:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
to age 75 to do that uh and the last
 
05:40:06.530 --> 05:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
point I guess I would I would note uh on
 
05:40:09.890 --> 05:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
this is that you know we don't limit
 
05:40:12.050 --> 05:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
um the other persons that are limited in
 
05:40:15.110 --> 05:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
the Constitution by age are sheriffs and
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
I I think that that you know
 
05:40:20.930 --> 05:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
that is a more physical law enforcement
 
05:40:23.330 --> 05:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
kind of job where you can understand uh
 
05:40:26.030 --> 05:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
that there may be a need for
 
05:40:28.430 --> 05:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
um an age limit uh but I I would
 
05:40:30.170 --> 05:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
respectfully submit to you that there is
 
05:40:32.690 --> 05:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
no more of a need for age limit
 
05:40:35.628 --> 05:40:35.638 align:start position:0%
of 70 on judges than there is for
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
legislators or the governor or or
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
anything and I think we have some pretty
 
05:40:42.590 --> 05:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
darn good legislators uh who are over
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
70. and uh do do a very good job so that
 
05:40:48.350 --> 05:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's kind of my pitch I hope you will
 
05:40:50.448 --> 05:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
agree with me I'm really honored that
 
05:40:52.910 --> 05:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie is here
 
05:40:55.010 --> 05:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
um uh to support this this proposed
 
05:40:56.150 --> 05:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it really is
 
05:40:56.160 --> 05:40:58.070 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it really is
bipartisan

05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
05:41:00.050 --> 05:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and I hope you're I hope you'll
 
05:41:02.030 --> 05:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
support it and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:41:04.970 --> 05:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone may have
 
05:41:07.510 --> 05:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
represent representative Smith
 
05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:41:09.600 --> 05:41:10.430 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
um

05:41:10.430 --> 05:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:13.430 --> 05:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for checking my question
 
05:41:15.410 --> 05:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for permitting me to
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
serve well past 70 or 75.
 
05:41:23.090 --> 05:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
um I uh I'm curious as to whether there
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
is any procedure in place in the
 
05:41:30.350 --> 05:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
judicial branch where if it came to pass
 
05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
that a judge or Justice regardless of
 
05:41:38.810 --> 05:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
age was manifesting
 
05:41:38.820 --> 05:41:39.490 align:start position:0%
age was manifesting
um

05:41:39.490 --> 05:41:39.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
signs that they perhaps were losing
 
05:41:45.910 --> 05:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
their acute mental acuity
 
05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
is there any provision for addressing
 
05:41:51.530 --> 05:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
that either formally or informally yeah
 
05:41:54.288 --> 05:41:54.298 align:start position:0%
that's a no that's a very good question
 
05:41:57.350 --> 05:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and and the answer is formally there
 
05:41:59.208 --> 05:41:59.218 align:start position:0%
formally there is I mean it's through
 
05:42:00.650 --> 05:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
the it would be through the code of
 
05:42:02.510 --> 05:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct
 
05:42:04.550 --> 05:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
um that you know that the a complaint
 
05:42:07.490 --> 05:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
could be filed if a judge were you know
 
05:42:10.128 --> 05:42:10.138 align:start position:0%
were unfit to serve that could that
 
05:42:11.750 --> 05:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
could happen
 
05:42:15.410 --> 05:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
um you know can't I mean candidly those
 
05:42:19.010 --> 05:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
kinds of things I I've I've I
 
05:42:21.770 --> 05:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
know from experience
 
05:42:23.570 --> 05:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
um with with federal judges particularly
 
05:42:25.490 --> 05:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
when I was a law clerk as I say federal
 
05:42:28.190 --> 05:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
judges are not subject to any age limit
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
um but there are times
 
05:42:33.410 --> 05:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
um when federal judges you know are they
 
05:42:36.410 --> 05:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
really are losing a step and it can and
 
05:42:39.350 --> 05:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
they can't be forced to retire
 
05:42:42.190 --> 05:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
um but it and and it can be very
 
05:42:44.448 --> 05:42:44.458 align:start position:0%
very difficult
 
05:42:45.948 --> 05:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
um you know that that's a very hard
 
05:42:49.070 --> 05:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
conversation for one judge or an or a
 
05:42:50.750 --> 05:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
supervisory judge whatever to have with
 
05:42:53.690 --> 05:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
a judge it's sort of like you know it's
 
05:42:56.510 --> 05:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
like uh it's like taking telling your
 
05:42:59.090 --> 05:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
your uh mother or your grandmother you
 
05:43:01.788 --> 05:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
can't drive anymore it's really it's
 
05:43:03.530 --> 05:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's really like that only maybe even
 
05:43:05.330 --> 05:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
out of my I mean the implications are
 
05:43:07.550 --> 05:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
probably even more because more
 
05:43:09.170 --> 05:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
important because of the power of a
 
05:43:10.670 --> 05:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
judge but the short answer to your
 
05:43:13.010 --> 05:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
question is yes there are provisions and
 
05:43:14.570 --> 05:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:43:17.810 --> 05:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
you know I think internally
 
05:43:19.430 --> 05:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
um judges
 
05:43:22.850 --> 05:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
are I think they they do understand the
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
importance of the positions that they
 
05:43:27.410 --> 05:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
hold and I think they are
 
05:43:29.208 --> 05:43:29.218 align:start position:0%
you know they do have their sort of
 
05:43:32.990 --> 05:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
antenna antennae up so to speak
 
05:43:35.810 --> 05:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
um is you know if if if another judge is
 
05:43:37.010 --> 05:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:43:38.810 --> 05:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
doing something that seems to be
 
05:43:40.430 --> 05:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
untoward or you know whether
 
05:43:42.890 --> 05:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
intentionally or because of because of
 
05:43:46.250 --> 05:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
some you know mental acuity problem so I
 
05:43:48.890 --> 05:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
I it's a hard issue but I think it there
 
05:43:51.470 --> 05:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
are Provisions that that uh that address
 
05:43:55.368 --> 05:43:55.378 align:start position:0%
that I think if I could follow-up
 
05:43:58.430 --> 05:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
I want I want to change the the arena
 
05:44:02.030 --> 05:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
rather dramatically on this matter and
 
05:44:02.040 --> 05:44:02.930 align:start position:0%
rather dramatically on this matter and
say

05:44:02.930 --> 05:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:44:06.650 --> 05:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
ask you whether you can
 
05:44:10.610 --> 05:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
conceive of a situation in which either
 
05:44:13.810 --> 05:44:13.820 align:start position:0%
raising the age to 75 or
 
05:44:17.150 --> 05:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
eliminating any age limit
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
could be misused politically
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
for example if it appears in this state
 
05:44:27.410 --> 05:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
where we do not elect judges we appoint
 
05:44:29.750 --> 05:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
them that
 
05:44:29.760 --> 05:44:30.970 align:start position:0%
them that
um

05:44:30.970 --> 05:44:30.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:35.868 --> 05:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
the uh the incumbent Governor uh might
 
05:44:39.530 --> 05:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
not be running again and might wonder
 
05:44:41.810 --> 05:44:41.820 align:start position:0%
and there might be some question as to
 
05:44:45.048 --> 05:44:45.058 align:start position:0%
the political loyalty of his successor
 
05:44:47.930 --> 05:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
or her successor could you imagine a
 
05:44:50.690 --> 05:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
situation in which uh
 
05:44:54.590 --> 05:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
judges approaching
 
05:44:59.590 --> 05:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
70 or 75 might be encouraged to resign
 
05:45:03.190 --> 05:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
so that very young
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
judges could be named in their place and
 
05:45:11.208 --> 05:45:11.218 align:start position:0%
therefore serve even if the political
 
05:45:16.010 --> 05:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
party in control of the governorship and
 
05:45:18.890 --> 05:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
executive Council were to change sure no
 
05:45:20.390 --> 05:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a very good question I
 
05:45:22.788 --> 05:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
you know I think candidly that I think
 
05:45:24.770 --> 05:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
that could happen I haven't seen any
 
05:45:27.288 --> 05:45:27.298 align:start position:0%
evidence in the time that I you know the
 
05:45:29.628 --> 05:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
27 year almost 27 years that I was a
 
05:45:32.570 --> 05:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
judge I haven't seen any evidence of
 
05:45:35.090 --> 05:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing happening but it
 
05:45:36.890 --> 05:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
could but I guess I would say to the
 
05:45:39.288 --> 05:45:39.298 align:start position:0%
extent that you know the scenario you're
 
05:45:41.570 --> 05:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
talking about could happen I I think
 
05:45:43.910 --> 05:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
that what the age limit is wouldn't
 
05:45:45.110 --> 05:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
really make that much difference I mean
 
05:45:46.670 --> 05:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
that could happen now it could happen
 
05:45:50.448 --> 05:45:50.458 align:start position:0%
that you know a governor could say you
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
know to somebody who's coming up on
 
05:45:54.830 --> 05:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
retire you know trying to exercise some
 
05:45:57.288 --> 05:45:57.298 align:start position:0%
pressure so that that Governor could
 
05:45:59.750 --> 05:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
appoint a younger person to replace him
 
05:46:02.510 --> 05:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
so I I think I haven't as I say I
 
05:46:04.250 --> 05:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any evidence in the time
 
05:46:06.110 --> 05:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
I've been a judge of that kind of thing
 
05:46:06.120 --> 05:46:08.030 align:start position:0%
I've been a judge of that kind of thing
happening

05:46:08.030 --> 05:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
happening
 
05:46:11.390 --> 05:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
but I suppose it could and I I do think
 
05:46:14.208 --> 05:46:14.218 align:start position:0%
that on that issue what the age limit is
 
05:46:15.470 --> 05:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make all that much
 
05:46:15.480 --> 05:46:16.610 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make all that much
difference

05:46:16.610 --> 05:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:46:19.610 --> 05:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:21.470 --> 05:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
05:46:23.750 --> 05:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative Lynn
 
05:46:25.250 --> 05:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions I have two if
 
05:46:28.250 --> 05:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
that's okay my first one is
 
05:46:30.170 --> 05:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
um kind of like a passing the torch
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
question because as a young person I'm
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
28 years old
 
05:46:38.208 --> 05:46:38.218 align:start position:0%
um is there a shortage of good potential
 
05:46:41.930 --> 05:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
judges or a a very small back bench of
 
05:46:43.490 --> 05:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
Judges that could replace I'm just
 
05:46:45.890 --> 05:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
worried about you know keeping keep
 
05:46:47.570 --> 05:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
keeping judges on five extra years would
 
05:46:48.770 --> 05:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
hold back once that would be great
 
05:46:48.780 --> 05:46:49.788 align:start position:0%
hold back once that would be great
judges

05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
judges
 
05:46:51.830 --> 05:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
right moving forward so do you have any
 
05:46:55.490 --> 05:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
kind of evidence to show it no I mean I
 
05:46:56.930 --> 05:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
think I
 
05:46:59.868 --> 05:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
getting a Judicial appointment is a very
 
05:47:01.910 --> 05:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know very highly sought after
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
position if you're a lawyer I think a
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
lot there's a lot of lawyers there's a
 
05:47:07.610 --> 05:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
lot more lawyers that want to be judges
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
and there are Judges available so
 
05:47:13.128 --> 05:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
candidly I think you know I I don't
 
05:47:15.288 --> 05:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
think we have we that that I could
 
05:47:17.810 --> 05:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
honestly sit here and say to you let's
 
05:47:21.170 --> 05:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
extend the age to 75 because otherwise
 
05:47:22.970 --> 05:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna have a shortage
 
05:47:25.190 --> 05:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
of Judges that I think that would that's
 
05:47:26.868 --> 05:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
not the case
 
05:47:28.368 --> 05:47:28.378 align:start position:0%
um but I do think
 
05:47:34.368 --> 05:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
um that um we lose some very good people
 
05:47:37.510 --> 05:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
um as as you know as judges and and I
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
that because I have to leave early and I
 
05:47:41.690 --> 05:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
guess the other thing I would say is
 
05:47:41.700 --> 05:47:42.948 align:start position:0%
guess the other thing I would say is
that

05:47:42.948 --> 05:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
to some extent
 
05:47:48.288 --> 05:47:48.298 align:start position:0%
um you lose the opportunity of having
 
05:47:52.128 --> 05:47:52.138 align:start position:0%
people appointed to the bench that are
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
you know are really sort of at the prime
 
05:47:56.930 --> 05:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
of their career but are a little bit
 
05:48:00.170 --> 05:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
older in other words for example if if
 
05:48:02.330 --> 05:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
someone under the way the way the
 
05:48:04.788 --> 05:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
retirement system works for judges and
 
05:48:06.590 --> 05:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
and it's a I want to be honest it's a
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
very good retirement system I don't have
 
05:48:10.910 --> 05:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
any complaints about that at all but the
 
05:48:15.410 --> 05:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
way it works is if you are if you are
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
appointed at let's say 62 if you're
 
05:48:22.070 --> 05:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
appointed at 63 and that still can be a
 
05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
very you know people can be very very
 
05:48:27.890 --> 05:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
much sort of uh mid-career or or maybe
 
05:48:29.570 --> 05:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
maybe sort of towards the end of their
 
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
career but still a very good career to
 
05:48:34.010 --> 05:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
go you get if you were appointed at 63
 
05:48:36.170 --> 05:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
you can only you can serve seven years
 
05:48:39.110 --> 05:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
and you get no if it's if
 
05:48:41.690 --> 05:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
it's exactly seven years you do get a 50
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
retirement but if it's any if it's one
 
05:48:45.708 --> 05:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
year less than than
 
05:48:47.628 --> 05:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
um then seven years you get no
 
05:48:49.490 --> 05:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
retirement so I'll give you an example
 
05:48:52.070 --> 05:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
Judge David Garfunkel served on the
 
05:48:53.990 --> 05:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
Superior Court wonderful judge he'd been
 
05:48:56.510 --> 05:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh director of the public defenders
 
05:48:58.610 --> 05:48:58.620 align:start position:0%
program for many years then was in
 
05:49:00.590 --> 05:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
private practice just a wonderful trial
 
05:49:02.868 --> 05:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
court judge he was on he only he got
 
05:49:05.390 --> 05:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
appointed at 63 and a half let's say
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
something like that he got no retirement
 
05:49:09.708 --> 05:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
uh he served for you know six and a half
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
years I did a wonderful job got no
 
05:49:12.000 --> 05:49:13.128 align:start position:0%
years I did a wonderful job got no
retirement

05:49:13.128 --> 05:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
um so I that you know that by by
 
05:49:19.548 --> 05:49:19.558 align:start position:0%
extending the age limit you would you
 
05:49:21.530 --> 05:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
would reduce the chances of things like
 
05:49:22.670 --> 05:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
05:49:24.650 --> 05:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you and one other question if I
 
05:49:24.660 --> 05:49:25.548 align:start position:0%
thank you and one other question if I
could

05:49:25.548 --> 05:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:49:27.170 --> 05:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad that there's a state senator
 
05:49:28.970 --> 05:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
in this room because maybe we can work
 
05:49:31.368 --> 05:49:31.378 align:start position:0%
together because I'm not allowed to run
 
05:49:33.470 --> 05:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
for Senate yet because I'm under the age
 
05:49:38.030 --> 05:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
of 30. so my question to you is maybe we
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
can work together on this would you be
 
05:49:41.448 --> 05:49:41.458 align:start position:0%
amendable if we change the age to run
 
05:49:42.830 --> 05:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
for Senate it also would not apply for
 
05:49:44.810 --> 05:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
me because I'd be able to run for Senate
 
05:49:47.690 --> 05:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
next time or something but we can change
 
05:49:49.070 --> 05:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
this all together would you be okay with
 
05:49:50.390 --> 05:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
that are you asking the question today
 
05:49:53.030 --> 05:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
oh I don't have any I don't have any
 
05:49:54.770 --> 05:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
problem with that awesome thank you no
 
05:49:54.780 --> 05:49:56.750 align:start position:0%
problem with that awesome thank you no
problem

05:49:56.750 --> 05:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Terror
 
05:50:02.270 --> 05:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks and and and I'll say um I
 
05:50:03.530 --> 05:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
and hopefully everyone in the committee
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
will set aside the fact that if this
 
05:50:06.650 --> 05:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
were in place we would be deprived of
 
05:50:09.288 --> 05:50:09.298 align:start position:0%
your leadership in this committee
 
05:50:11.868 --> 05:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
um no you wouldn't I'm not going based
 
05:50:13.788 --> 05:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
on not going anywhere based on based on
 
05:50:16.128 --> 05:50:16.138 align:start position:0%
that you would still be on the bench um
 
05:50:18.170 --> 05:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
my question symbol I think the first
 
05:50:19.788 --> 05:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
half of it already got answered which is
 
05:50:22.730 --> 05:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
I got the sense there's not a Workforce
 
05:50:27.230 --> 05:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
or or shortage uh driven uh purpose
 
05:50:29.330 --> 05:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
behind behind this as there are for so
 
05:50:31.548 --> 05:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
many sort of other positions these days
 
05:50:34.128 --> 05:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
no I candidly no they're they're really
 
05:50:35.810 --> 05:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
aren't there's there's it's a very
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
sought after position and then sort of
 
05:50:39.470 --> 05:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
the related question are you do you know
 
05:50:42.650 --> 05:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
how many people have have been uh um hit
 
05:50:45.590 --> 05:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
this limit in in a year and past X
 
05:50:47.570 --> 05:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
number of years boy well
 
05:50:47.580 --> 05:50:48.650 align:start position:0%
number of years boy well
um

05:50:48.650 --> 05:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:52.610 --> 05:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:52.620 --> 05:50:53.208 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:50:53.208 --> 05:50:53.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:58.128 --> 05:50:58.138 align:start position:0%
judge uh Duggan who's now passed I mean
 
05:51:00.288 --> 05:51:00.298 align:start position:0%
but he he he hit this you know he
 
05:51:03.048 --> 05:51:03.058 align:start position:0%
retired just before he turned 70. I
 
05:51:04.910 --> 05:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
think he was a wonderful judge I think
 
05:51:06.530 --> 05:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
he probably would not have retired if
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
the if the you know 70 age limit uh
 
05:51:14.570 --> 05:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
justice Convoy as I mentioned uh myself
 
05:51:17.510 --> 05:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I know uh justice Hicks
 
05:51:19.368 --> 05:51:19.378 align:start position:0%
um who's on the bench now he will turn
 
05:51:22.970 --> 05:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
70. I believe next October and you know
 
05:51:25.610 --> 05:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
I'm uh I mean obviously he's going to go
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
but still on under the under on the
 
05:51:29.510 --> 05:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
existing law but I think he would be
 
05:51:33.410 --> 05:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
would be very likely to want to stay
 
05:51:36.230 --> 05:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
um if the uh if if the age limit wasn't
 
05:51:38.570 --> 05:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
70 and there's a number of superior I
 
05:51:38.580 --> 05:51:39.530 align:start position:0%
70 and there's a number of superior I
mean

05:51:39.530 --> 05:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
mean
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
Kenny I don't know if some of you know
 
05:51:44.930 --> 05:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
Ken McHugh was a long long time Superior
 
05:51:49.010 --> 05:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
Court judge just a wonderful judge
 
05:51:52.190 --> 05:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
um he you know he he's like 78 now or 79
 
05:51:54.890 --> 05:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
he'd still be there if he could and he's
 
05:51:57.470 --> 05:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
still going strong I see him every you
 
05:51:59.570 --> 05:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
know occasionally uh so I think there's
 
05:52:02.030 --> 05:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
a number of a number of Judges judge
 
05:52:04.070 --> 05:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
smuckler another example
 
05:52:06.170 --> 05:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a number of Judges
 
05:52:07.730 --> 05:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
who would stay who would have stayed if
 
05:52:10.250 --> 05:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:10.260 --> 05:52:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:52:12.830 --> 05:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:14.990 --> 05:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
05:52:16.850 --> 05:52:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:52:16.860 --> 05:52:19.548 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr

05:52:19.548 --> 05:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:22.548 --> 05:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
05:52:24.770 --> 05:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
the uh I guess I'm going to show my
 
05:52:28.070 --> 05:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
ignorance here but uh
 
05:52:29.580 --> 05:52:29.590 align:start position:0%
the constitutional
 
05:52:29.590 --> 05:52:31.010 align:start position:0%
the constitutional
[Music]

05:52:31.010 --> 05:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
retirement age does that apply only to
 
05:52:36.770 --> 05:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Justices or is it all
 
05:52:39.048 --> 05:52:39.058 align:start position:0%
Justice all judges all judges in the
 
05:52:42.830 --> 05:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
state no all right so this will be uh
 
05:52:44.990 --> 05:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
you'll be backing up the uh the young
 
05:52:46.490 --> 05:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
people even more
 
05:52:49.730 --> 05:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
if I uh passed in this uh Constitutional
 
05:52:51.830 --> 05:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment well you know there I mean you
 
05:52:52.850 --> 05:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I don't think you should
 
05:52:55.548 --> 05:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
assume that all judges will stay till
 
05:52:57.410 --> 05:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
70. I mean there are a number of Judges
 
05:53:00.230 --> 05:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
who who uh who you know who were good
 
05:53:01.970 --> 05:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
judges but but you know once they got
 
05:53:03.948 --> 05:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
eligible once they became eligible for
 
05:53:07.128 --> 05:53:07.138 align:start position:0%
retirement which um depending on how
 
05:53:08.628 --> 05:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
many years of service you have can be as
 
05:53:10.490 --> 05:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
young as 60 under the current retirement
 
05:53:13.190 --> 05:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
system some judges you know were very
 
05:53:15.770 --> 05:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
very good judges leave uh judge Abramson
 
05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
a good friend of mine you know she was
 
05:53:19.730 --> 05:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
she was a long time Superior Court Judge
 
05:53:23.270 --> 05:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
excellent judge she left at age 60. she
 
05:53:26.208 --> 05:53:26.218 align:start position:0%
she sits in Us in senior status from
 
05:53:28.548 --> 05:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
time to time but she's she left
 
05:53:30.590 --> 05:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
um at age 60 there's others that have
 
05:53:31.850 --> 05:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
done that
 
05:53:33.830 --> 05:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
um you know so I think it depends on who
 
05:53:35.750 --> 05:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
05:53:37.850 --> 05:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
this isn't a question that is a comment
 
05:53:41.090 --> 05:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
that I saw a uh in the newspaper a
 
05:53:43.190 --> 05:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
couple days ago there was a there's a
 
05:53:45.830 --> 05:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
quote by somebody saying that uh in New
 
05:53:48.590 --> 05:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when you retire you either go
 
05:53:52.128 --> 05:53:52.138 align:start position:0%
to uh Florida or the uh House of
 
05:53:52.138 --> 05:53:53.930 align:start position:0%
to uh Florida or the uh House of
Representatives

05:53:53.930 --> 05:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
05:53:56.628 --> 05:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
05:54:00.110 --> 05:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe thank you
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:14.150 --> 05:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
I was doing research on this bill I came
 
05:54:17.570 --> 05:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
across some states that would allow
 
05:54:20.628 --> 05:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
judges to retire
 
05:54:23.390 --> 05:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
um no to continue working after you know
 
05:54:25.490 --> 05:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
whatever the age limit is but they had
 
05:54:27.770 --> 05:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
to Forfeit getting paid had you heard
 
05:54:30.110 --> 05:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
about that or do you have any feelings
 
05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
or thoughts on that I I wasn't aware of
 
05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
that or to be honest with you I thought
 
05:54:38.868 --> 05:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
I know that some states have
 
05:54:41.690 --> 05:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
a system where you know even if you're
 
05:54:43.788 --> 05:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
even if you're over the age limit you
 
05:54:46.490 --> 05:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
can serve in some and I should say that
 
05:54:50.810 --> 05:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
that you know in in New Hampshire a a
 
05:54:54.110 --> 05:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
judge who is over 70 can
 
05:54:56.750 --> 05:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
serve as sort of a uh what's what are
 
05:54:59.150 --> 05:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
the what's the term they use uh mediator
 
05:55:01.190 --> 05:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
yeah a Judicial referee in other words
 
05:55:02.410 --> 05:55:02.420 align:start position:0%
can't can't
 
05:55:05.090 --> 05:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
there any or anything that they do it's
 
05:55:06.530 --> 05:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
limited to what they can do and their
 
05:55:08.570 --> 05:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
orders have to be countersigned by an
 
05:55:11.510 --> 05:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
active judge I think I misspoke for a
 
05:55:11.520 --> 05:55:12.470 align:start position:0%
active judge I think I misspoke for a
second there

05:55:12.470 --> 05:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
second there
 
05:55:19.070 --> 05:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:20.930 --> 05:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
I thought that's really strange oh I'm
 
05:55:23.868 --> 05:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware every time okay I'm not
 
05:55:26.690 --> 05:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
aware of I'm not aware of that I'm uh
 
05:55:27.948 --> 05:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:55:27.958 --> 05:55:30.170 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

05:55:30.170 --> 05:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative go right ahead
 
05:55:38.270 --> 05:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:41.090 --> 05:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
did I know that Smith said if in regards
 
05:55:45.530 --> 05:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
to if you had a judge that um reached
 
05:55:48.530 --> 05:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
the age of 70 or if we put it up to 60
 
05:55:48.540 --> 05:55:50.510 align:start position:0%
the age of 70 or if we put it up to 60
75

05:55:50.510 --> 05:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
75
 
05:55:53.330 --> 05:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
um what would happen if they were
 
05:55:56.208 --> 05:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
failing in their mental capacity but
 
05:55:57.850 --> 05:55:57.860 align:start position:0%
then refused
 
05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
refuse to leave what would be done at
 
05:56:03.650 --> 05:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
that point I think the judicial thank
 
05:56:04.850 --> 05:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
you that's a very good question I think
 
05:56:06.470 --> 05:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct committee would
 
05:56:08.208 --> 05:56:08.218 align:start position:0%
have the authority
 
05:56:11.030 --> 05:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
to recommend I mean the Supreme Court
 
05:56:13.548 --> 05:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court would have to make
 
05:56:15.650 --> 05:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
the ultimate to say the other the other
 
05:56:17.270 --> 05:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
if it was a Supreme Court Judge the
 
05:56:19.970 --> 05:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
other members of the Supreme Court but
 
05:56:21.650 --> 05:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
they would have the authority to say
 
05:56:24.830 --> 05:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
that the judge they can't
 
05:56:27.410 --> 05:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
they can't you know they can't impeach a
 
05:56:29.150 --> 05:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
judge but what they could say is the
 
05:56:31.910 --> 05:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
judge no longer has the authority to to
 
05:56:34.010 --> 05:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
exercise judicial power
 
05:56:37.730 --> 05:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:39.470 --> 05:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
05:56:39.480 --> 05:56:41.150 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
Lynn

05:56:41.150 --> 05:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
Lynn
 
05:56:43.310 --> 05:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
saying none great thank you thank you
 
05:56:50.690 --> 05:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:52.850 --> 05:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman members
 
05:56:54.110 --> 05:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record I'm
 
05:56:56.030 --> 05:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
Donna soucy I represent Senate District
 
05:56:58.250 --> 05:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
18 which is comprised of the town of
 
05:57:01.010 --> 05:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
Litchfield and Wards five through nine
 
05:57:03.530 --> 05:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester and I am a
 
05:57:05.690 --> 05:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
proud co-sponsor of this legislation and
 
05:57:07.490 --> 05:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
I I truly appreciate having the
 
05:57:08.990 --> 05:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sit through and hear some
 
05:57:10.190 --> 05:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
of the questions that the committee
 
05:57:11.868 --> 05:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
members ask because I really think they
 
05:57:14.030 --> 05:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
are quite Salient something that we
 
05:57:16.310 --> 05:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
should all consider before moving
 
05:57:19.010 --> 05:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
forward but it you know just to bring us
 
05:57:21.470 --> 05:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
back I think it needs to be made clear
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
70 is the youngest age
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
through all all of the states in the
 
05:57:26.878 --> 05:57:27.530 align:start position:0%
through all all of the states in the
union

05:57:27.530 --> 05:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
union
 
05:57:29.930 --> 05:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
um that judges are forced to retire so
 
05:57:33.110 --> 05:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
making this this incremental change to
 
05:57:36.650 --> 05:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
age 75 would still have us on the
 
05:57:36.660 --> 05:57:37.730 align:start position:0%
age 75 would still have us on the
younger

05:57:37.730 --> 05:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
younger
 
05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
um the younger end of required
 
05:57:40.080 --> 05:57:41.330 align:start position:0%
um the younger end of required
retirement

05:57:41.330 --> 05:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
05:57:44.690 --> 05:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh this was age 70 was placed in the
 
05:57:44.700 --> 05:57:46.010 align:start position:0%
uh this was age 70 was placed in the
Constitution

05:57:46.010 --> 05:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
05:57:49.610 --> 05:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
um in 1971 the Constitutional Convention
 
05:57:52.490 --> 05:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
voted on it and then seven excuse me in
 
05:57:57.230 --> 05:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
1791 and then 1792 was enacted some of
 
05:57:59.090 --> 05:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
the studies I've looked at put life
 
05:58:01.970 --> 05:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
expectancy at that time about 35 years
 
05:58:03.890 --> 05:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
of age
 
05:58:07.128 --> 05:58:07.138 align:start position:0%
um so uh 70 was
 
05:58:09.770 --> 05:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
I think what we would consider a hundred
 
05:58:11.510 --> 05:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
05:58:15.110 --> 05:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
um it was uh a very very Advanced age
 
05:58:17.990 --> 05:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's what the founders of our our state
 
05:58:20.930 --> 05:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
and what the the Constitutional drafters
 
05:58:23.030 --> 05:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh thought was important that it'd be
 
05:58:26.090 --> 05:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
someone of an advanced age that could
 
05:58:27.948 --> 05:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
sit on the bench
 
05:58:30.470 --> 05:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
I think what's really important is to
 
05:58:33.650 --> 05:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
consider also um the medical advances
 
05:58:36.230 --> 05:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
that have occurred since then since the
 
05:58:40.610 --> 05:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
late 1700s uh we are all living longer
 
05:58:43.070 --> 05:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
we live in a state that's one of the
 
05:58:45.948 --> 05:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
oldest states in the country and one of
 
05:58:47.090 --> 05:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
the things although I certainly have
 
05:58:49.310 --> 05:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
never sat on the bench I'm I'm a lawyer
 
05:58:50.990 --> 05:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
I have been in court in practice before
 
05:58:52.970 --> 05:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
judges but one of the things that I
 
05:58:55.930 --> 05:58:55.940 align:start position:0%
think makes a good judge or Justice
 
05:59:01.070 --> 05:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
is their ability to to reason uh to work
 
05:59:03.410 --> 05:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
through the arguments to be open to
 
05:59:05.350 --> 05:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
hearing all of the different arguments
 
05:59:09.708 --> 05:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the best judges I think are
 
05:59:12.470 --> 05:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
more experienced judges and the more
 
05:59:16.548 --> 05:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
time spent hearing cases and varieties
 
05:59:17.868 --> 05:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
of cases
 
05:59:22.128 --> 05:59:22.138 align:start position:0%
um I think makes you know someone uh a
 
05:59:24.170 --> 05:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
very very good judge I mean
 
05:59:26.270 --> 05:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn mentioned a number
 
05:59:29.330 --> 05:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
of Judges who really I think were at the
 
05:59:31.548 --> 05:59:31.558 align:start position:0%
prime of their careers but were forced
 
05:59:33.470 --> 05:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
to retire I think of Justice Convoy
 
05:59:37.788 --> 05:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
Justice delanis people that uh were
 
05:59:41.448 --> 05:59:41.458 align:start position:0%
certainly capable able able
 
05:59:45.048 --> 05:59:45.058 align:start position:0%
um very very good practicing judges who
 
05:59:48.890 --> 05:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
were forced to end their careers but I
 
05:59:50.270 --> 05:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
also think we have to remember on the
 
05:59:52.610 --> 05:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
other side there's nothing precluding
 
05:59:54.770 --> 05:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
someone from retiring early should
 
05:59:57.770 --> 05:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
someone choose to retire at age 60 or 62
 
05:59:59.750 --> 05:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
and they're sitting on the bed that will
 
06:00:03.170 --> 06:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
always be up to the individual to decide
 
06:00:05.330 --> 06:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
as long as you know they're acting
 
06:00:08.390 --> 06:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
within the confines of the law
 
06:00:08.400 --> 06:00:09.770 align:start position:0%
within the confines of the law
but

06:00:09.770 --> 06:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:00:12.170 --> 06:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
I do think that we're doing a disservice
 
06:00:14.390 --> 06:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
to ourselves forcing some of the people
 
06:00:15.890 --> 06:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
that currently
 
06:00:18.048 --> 06:00:18.058 align:start position:0%
um sit on the bench and have in recent
 
06:00:22.070 --> 06:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
years past forcing them out at age 70 in
 
06:00:25.368 --> 06:00:25.378 align:start position:0%
this day and age in 2023
 
06:00:28.850 --> 06:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
um there are very very capable able
 
06:00:33.110 --> 06:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
people that are age 70 and Beyond doing
 
06:00:36.288 --> 06:00:36.298 align:start position:0%
great work uh either practicing as
 
06:00:38.390 --> 06:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
lawyers practicing any number of
 
06:00:41.810 --> 06:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
professions and I think this is a simple
 
06:00:44.330 --> 06:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
change that I would hope this committee
 
06:00:47.510 --> 06:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
would look favorably upon and I remind
 
06:00:49.430 --> 06:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
you that really ultimately the question
 
06:00:52.010 --> 06:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
is one for the voters so this would be a
 
06:00:55.070 --> 06:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
question placed on the 2024 ballot and
 
06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know it would be up to the voters to
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
vote it up or down as you know the other
 
06:01:00.830 --> 06:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
thing that's kind of unique about New
 
06:01:02.930 --> 06:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a very high threshold
 
06:01:06.470 --> 06:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
in which to amend our constitution so it
 
06:01:07.670 --> 06:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's more than a simple
 
06:01:09.410 --> 06:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
majority it would take a number of
 
06:01:12.470 --> 06:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
Voters viewing this in a positive light
 
06:01:14.810 --> 06:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
but I think it's it's a good change it's
 
06:01:18.170 --> 06:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
an incremental change and I think it
 
06:01:20.330 --> 06:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
would benefit the state of New Hampshire
 
06:01:22.490 --> 06:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
with that I'd conclude my testimony and
 
06:01:30.650 --> 06:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:33.770 --> 06:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
any questions from Senator Susie
 
06:01:35.448 --> 06:01:35.458 align:start position:0%
they were all covered by oh
 
06:01:44.690 --> 06:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:48.110 --> 06:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
um life expectancy has um
 
06:01:48.120 --> 06:01:49.610 align:start position:0%
um life expectancy has um
change

06:01:49.610 --> 06:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
change
 
06:01:52.670 --> 06:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
um quite a bit and I was thinking not
 
06:01:55.010 --> 06:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
only do we have a greater life expense
 
06:01:57.770 --> 06:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
expectancy but we also have
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
um digital
 
06:02:00.120 --> 06:02:00.770 align:start position:0%
um digital
um

06:02:00.770 --> 06:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:04.190 --> 06:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
in electronic processes that make the
 
06:02:06.288 --> 06:02:06.298 align:start position:0%
workload easier for folks do you think
 
06:02:08.690 --> 06:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
that would have any has any effect on
 
06:02:11.270 --> 06:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
retirement age for judges
 
06:02:13.128 --> 06:02:13.138 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
06:02:16.788 --> 06:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
um certainly uh the workload
 
06:02:19.010 --> 06:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
um certainly representative Lynn could
 
06:02:21.470 --> 06:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
speak to more directly but yeah I I
 
06:02:25.190 --> 06:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
agree unlike sheriffs which are also
 
06:02:27.170 --> 06:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
Limited in the age in which they can
 
06:02:27.180 --> 06:02:28.730 align:start position:0%
Limited in the age in which they can
serve

06:02:28.730 --> 06:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
serve
 
06:02:32.570 --> 06:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
the work is not as physical and it can
 
06:02:36.170 --> 06:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
be assisted by electronic devices and
 
06:02:38.810 --> 06:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know many people live
 
06:02:41.570 --> 06:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
longer healthier lives than when this
 
06:02:43.490 --> 06:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
age was originally established I think
 
06:02:45.470 --> 06:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
are all important factors that I hope
 
06:02:48.230 --> 06:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
this committee will consider the house
 
06:02:49.970 --> 06:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully when we get to the
 
06:02:51.708 --> 06:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
Senate we can consider that as well so I
 
06:02:54.830 --> 06:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question thank you
 
06:02:58.368 --> 06:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Senator Susie
 
06:02:59.990 --> 06:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your time
 
06:03:02.090 --> 06:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:03:03.948 --> 06:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls representative
 
06:03:03.958 --> 06:03:07.070 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls representative
Heinz

06:03:07.070 --> 06:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:08.510 --> 06:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
once again
 
06:03:10.310 --> 06:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Wallace Dan Hines
 
06:03:11.330 --> 06:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
Town of Bedford representing
 
06:03:12.948 --> 06:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough too I'll be brief um
 
06:03:14.868 --> 06:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
because pretty much a lot of what people
 
06:03:16.730 --> 06:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
have said has been covered but uh I'll
 
06:03:17.990 --> 06:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
just point out this is essentially age
 
06:03:20.628 --> 06:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
of scrub emanation in employment
 
06:03:22.788 --> 06:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire does not like that we
 
06:03:24.350 --> 06:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
have an anti-discrimination statute
 
06:03:26.330 --> 06:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
specifically prohibiting it
 
06:03:27.590 --> 06:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
um if there weren't this constitutional
 
06:03:30.110 --> 06:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
amendment I would suggest this would not
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
be allowed to be
 
06:03:34.190 --> 06:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
um and I think there is a lot of overlap
 
06:03:37.610 --> 06:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
between a legislator and a judge um so
 
06:03:40.490 --> 06:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
one thinks about a law and potential
 
06:03:42.110 --> 06:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
consequences on how it might be applied
 
06:03:44.810 --> 06:03:44.820 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day a judge applies
 
06:03:46.868 --> 06:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
facts to the law and interprets that law
 
06:03:50.330 --> 06:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
both require logical thinking critical
 
06:03:53.150 --> 06:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
thinking and a lot of analysis and I
 
06:03:55.910 --> 06:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
think if there are a proposed cacr to
 
06:03:59.090 --> 06:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
set the legislature age of 70. it would
 
06:04:00.650 --> 06:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
not go over a very favorable poll in
 
06:04:02.810 --> 06:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
front of the legislature so I'd ask that
 
06:04:05.868 --> 06:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
the same type of accommodation be given
 
06:04:07.070 --> 06:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
I personally don't think there should be
 
06:04:09.288 --> 06:04:09.298 align:start position:0%
any limit but I do agree Justice land
 
06:04:11.810 --> 06:04:11.820 align:start position:0%
that 75 is certainly better than 70 and
 
06:04:14.330 --> 06:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
light of the times changing essentially
 
06:04:18.470 --> 06:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
and if the constitutional
 
06:04:21.350 --> 06:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
um as it as it is if there's a problem
 
06:04:23.690 --> 06:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
with bad judges we already have remedies
 
06:04:26.810 --> 06:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
and I think the solution is to address
 
06:04:30.048 --> 06:04:30.058 align:start position:0%
that specific Judge and not ban all
 
06:04:31.430 --> 06:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
judges because I think at the end of the
 
06:04:33.948 --> 06:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
day what this does is eliminates and
 
06:04:35.570 --> 06:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
forces into retirement a lot of good
 
06:04:38.448 --> 06:04:38.458 align:start position:0%
judges and since we're over time I won't
 
06:04:41.150 --> 06:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
be taking any questions thank you
 
06:04:43.970 --> 06:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Heinz
 
06:04:47.448 --> 06:04:47.458 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll adjourn the hearing
 
06:04:50.990 --> 06:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:54.288 --> 06:04:54.298 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so now we will turn to the
 
06:04:55.548 --> 06:04:55.558 align:start position:0%
hearing on the last bill of the day
 
06:04:57.530 --> 06:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
that's uh HB
 
06:05:02.030 --> 06:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:02.040 --> 06:05:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:05:11.750 --> 06:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:15.288 --> 06:05:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:15.298 --> 06:05:16.368 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:05:16.368 --> 06:05:16.378 align:start position:0%

uh oh Ray I yeah I should fill out a
 
06:05:34.070 --> 06:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
pink card
 
06:05:36.230 --> 06:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
um oh right representative um did you do
 
06:05:38.330 --> 06:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
you have the code yeah yeah
 
06:05:39.890 --> 06:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
um do you want me to do that now or
 
06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards okay oh you're gonna fill one
 
06:05:43.490 --> 06:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
out is that it yeah I'll fill it out
 
06:05:46.490 --> 06:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
yeah all right sure go ahead
 
06:05:49.910 --> 06:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
so uh hi I'm
 
06:05:53.810 --> 06:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
Eric Gallagher I represent Merrimack
 
06:05:56.810 --> 06:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
County District 20 which is
 
06:06:02.510 --> 06:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
Concord Ward 6 and I'm here to introduce
 
06:06:06.948 --> 06:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
House Bill 63 relative to religious use
 
06:06:10.430 --> 06:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:10.440 --> 06:06:12.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:12.718 --> 06:06:16.010 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:06:16.010 --> 06:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:18.230 --> 06:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just going to start with a
 
06:06:18.240 --> 06:06:19.190 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just going to start with a
little

06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
little
 
06:06:21.590 --> 06:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
legislative history here
 
06:06:21.600 --> 06:06:22.128 align:start position:0%
legislative history here
um

06:06:22.128 --> 06:06:22.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:25.788 --> 06:06:25.798 align:start position:0%
this is actually kind of the result of
 
06:06:31.368 --> 06:06:31.378 align:start position:0%
two separate uh bills from last term
 
06:06:31.378 --> 06:06:32.090 align:start position:0%
two separate uh bills from last term
um

06:06:32.090 --> 06:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:35.030 --> 06:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
so I had my
 
06:06:36.470 --> 06:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
own bill
 
06:06:36.480 --> 06:06:37.430 align:start position:0%
own bill
um

06:06:37.430 --> 06:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
um

last term which
 
06:06:52.910 --> 06:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
was intended to make it easier for
 
06:06:56.390 --> 06:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
religious organizations such as churches
 
06:07:00.590 --> 06:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
who turn their parking lots into housing
 
06:07:05.288 --> 06:07:05.298 align:start position:0%
if they're safe facing declining
 
06:07:07.788 --> 06:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
declining membership and want to do
 
06:07:12.708 --> 06:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
something with that space so
 
06:07:14.448 --> 06:07:14.458 align:start position:0%

um

06:07:16.970 --> 06:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:19.010 --> 06:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
came before
 
06:07:21.048 --> 06:07:21.058 align:start position:0%
my own committee Municipal and County
 
06:07:21.058 --> 06:07:22.850 align:start position:0%
my own committee Municipal and County
Government

06:07:22.850 --> 06:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
Government
 
06:07:22.860 --> 06:07:23.868 align:start position:0%
Government
um

06:07:23.868 --> 06:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:28.310 --> 06:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
and at the hearing for it one of the
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
points that was brought up was that
 
06:07:32.400 --> 06:07:33.650 align:start position:0%
points that was brought up was that
um

06:07:33.650 --> 06:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:39.470 --> 06:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
it conflicted with House Bill 1021
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh from that year
 
06:07:41.520 --> 06:07:42.830 align:start position:0%
uh from that year
uh

06:07:42.830 --> 06:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:07:42.840 --> 06:07:44.208 align:start position:0%
uh
which

06:07:44.208 --> 06:07:44.218 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:07:44.218 --> 06:07:45.650 align:start position:0%
which
also

06:07:45.650 --> 06:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:07:47.990 --> 06:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
um which was a more
 
06:07:52.670 --> 06:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
General Bill about religious land use
 
06:07:52.680 --> 06:07:53.570 align:start position:0%
General Bill about religious land use
um

06:07:53.570 --> 06:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:55.788 --> 06:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:07:58.610 --> 06:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
I reached out to the sponsors of that
 
06:07:58.620 --> 06:07:59.930 align:start position:0%
I reached out to the sponsors of that
bill

06:07:59.930 --> 06:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:07:59.940 --> 06:08:01.730 align:start position:0%
bill
um

06:08:01.730 --> 06:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:03.708 --> 06:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
06:08:07.850 --> 06:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
figure out if the house bill 1021 would
 
06:08:10.850 --> 06:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
in fact cover the case that I was
 
06:08:13.430 --> 06:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about of uh churches building
 
06:08:16.810 --> 06:08:16.820 align:start position:0%
housing and the answer seemed
 
06:08:16.820 --> 06:08:18.770 align:start position:0%
housing and the answer seemed
inconclusive

06:08:18.770 --> 06:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
inconclusive
 
06:08:18.780 --> 06:08:19.670 align:start position:0%
inconclusive
um

06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:19.680 --> 06:08:22.548 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:24.410 --> 06:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
um yeah I've
 
06:08:28.128 --> 06:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
I decided to file this year's bill
 
06:08:30.770 --> 06:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 63 to
 
06:08:30.780 --> 06:08:32.510 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 63 to
uh

06:08:32.510 --> 06:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:36.110 --> 06:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
provide some clarity that yes the
 
06:08:36.120 --> 06:08:37.810 align:start position:0%
provide some clarity that yes the
language

06:08:37.810 --> 06:08:37.820 align:start position:0%
language
 
06:08:40.190 --> 06:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
from last year's
 
06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1021 can in fact be used to
 
06:08:45.590 --> 06:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
make it easier refrigerator just to
 
06:08:47.090 --> 06:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
build housing
 
06:08:48.650 --> 06:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
um so and then
 
06:08:48.660 --> 06:08:49.910 align:start position:0%
um so and then
um

06:08:49.910 --> 06:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:51.670 --> 06:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the process
 
06:08:54.890 --> 06:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
of studying the bill
 
06:08:54.900 --> 06:08:55.910 align:start position:0%
of studying the bill
um

06:08:55.910 --> 06:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:58.430 --> 06:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
I also learned about
 
06:09:03.530 --> 06:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
some concerns that the uh Municipal
 
06:09:05.448 --> 06:09:05.458 align:start position:0%
Association had
 
06:09:05.458 --> 06:09:06.708 align:start position:0%
Association had
with

06:09:06.708 --> 06:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:09:09.410 --> 06:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
the existing language that was added
 
06:09:13.490 --> 06:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
previously in House Bill 1021 uh so
 
06:09:15.890 --> 06:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
I uh
 
06:09:18.650 --> 06:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
I Incorporated their concerns into this
 
06:09:21.288 --> 06:09:21.298 align:start position:0%
bill as well so it
 
06:09:23.390 --> 06:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's basically just doing a little bit
 
06:09:23.400 --> 06:09:24.948 align:start position:0%
it's basically just doing a little bit
of

06:09:24.948 --> 06:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:09:28.010 --> 06:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
reward rewording of
 
06:09:32.628 --> 06:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
the statute to make it a bit clearer of
 
06:09:32.638 --> 06:09:33.530 align:start position:0%
the statute to make it a bit clearer of
um

06:09:33.530 --> 06:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:35.990 --> 06:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
what exactly
 
06:09:38.948 --> 06:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
towns can and can't do with
 
06:09:41.628 --> 06:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
religious land use
 
06:09:41.638 --> 06:09:43.070 align:start position:0%
religious land use
um

06:09:43.070 --> 06:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:44.810 --> 06:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
06:09:48.288 --> 06:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
yeah nature Grays from the municipal
 
06:09:48.298 --> 06:09:49.670 align:start position:0%
yeah nature Grays from the municipal
Association

06:09:49.670 --> 06:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
Association
 
06:09:51.830 --> 06:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh should be
 
06:09:57.288 --> 06:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
here to testify to that part of it um
 
06:09:57.298 --> 06:09:58.970 align:start position:0%
here to testify to that part of it um
so

06:09:58.970 --> 06:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:03.590 --> 06:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
I've also heard that um
 
06:10:05.990 --> 06:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
so one of my co-sponsors uh
 
06:10:08.570 --> 06:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney will be
 
06:10:08.580 --> 06:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney will be
introducing

06:10:10.310 --> 06:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
06:10:13.010 --> 06:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
06:10:13.020 --> 06:10:13.788 align:start position:0%
an amendment
um

06:10:13.788 --> 06:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:18.350 --> 06:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
to bring it back a little bit closer to
 
06:10:23.208 --> 06:10:23.218 align:start position:0%
the original language of last year's
 
06:10:25.730 --> 06:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1021 and
 
06:10:28.670 --> 06:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that I'm okay with with
 
06:10:30.410 --> 06:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
the bill either with or without the
 
06:10:33.048 --> 06:10:33.058 align:start position:0%
amendment the main thing I want to see
 
06:10:35.868 --> 06:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
added is just the clarification about
 
06:10:38.930 --> 06:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
housing being covered under it
 
06:10:38.940 --> 06:10:39.770 align:start position:0%
housing being covered under it
um

06:10:39.770 --> 06:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:39.780 --> 06:10:42.170 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:10:42.170 --> 06:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:46.490 --> 06:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh and with that I'll take any questions
 
06:10:48.650 --> 06:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
from members of committee representative
 
06:10:48.660 --> 06:10:55.610 align:start position:0%
from members of committee representative
testerman

06:10:55.610 --> 06:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:59.570 --> 06:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
have you do you know of any specific
 
06:10:59.580 --> 06:11:00.890 align:start position:0%
have you do you know of any specific
case

06:11:00.890 --> 06:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
case
 
06:11:02.570 --> 06:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
where your
 
06:11:05.030 --> 06:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the bill or your amendment
 
06:11:06.770 --> 06:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
to this legislation
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
will will make it better I mean is there
 
06:11:12.170 --> 06:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
a problem there or some problem that has
 
06:11:14.030 --> 06:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
been created with the existing
 
06:11:14.040 --> 06:11:15.530 align:start position:0%
been created with the existing
legislation

06:11:15.530 --> 06:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:11:18.230 --> 06:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
I don't mean that the the original
 
06:11:20.448 --> 06:11:20.458 align:start position:0%
writing that done with the final one
 
06:11:22.730 --> 06:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
you've got here is there any problem
 
06:11:24.230 --> 06:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
06:11:28.490 --> 06:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
well mostly just the uncertainty of it
 
06:11:28.500 --> 06:11:29.208 align:start position:0%
well mostly just the uncertainty of it
um

06:11:29.208 --> 06:11:29.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:29.218 --> 06:11:30.708 align:start position:0%
um
like

06:11:30.708 --> 06:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:11:33.048 --> 06:11:33.058 align:start position:0%
just from talking with town and
 
06:11:36.350 --> 06:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal officials they are confused by
 
06:11:38.208 --> 06:11:38.218 align:start position:0%
it and need some clarity
 
06:11:41.270 --> 06:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of specific
 
06:11:44.330 --> 06:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh developments um
 
06:11:44.340 --> 06:11:45.830 align:start position:0%
uh developments um
well

06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:11:48.650 --> 06:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
so for example
 
06:11:48.660 --> 06:11:50.208 align:start position:0%
so for example
um

06:11:50.208 --> 06:11:50.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:52.788 --> 06:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
well I'll give some examples of some
 
06:11:56.208 --> 06:11:56.218 align:start position:0%
places that did some Churches or
 
06:11:58.070 --> 06:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
religious organizations that did
 
06:11:58.080 --> 06:11:59.690 align:start position:0%
religious organizations that did
successfully

06:11:59.690 --> 06:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
do housing related stuff so
 
06:12:02.638 --> 06:12:03.650 align:start position:0%
do housing related stuff so
um

06:12:03.650 --> 06:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:03.660 --> 06:12:05.150 align:start position:0%
um
they're

06:12:05.150 --> 06:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:12:07.128 --> 06:12:07.138 align:start position:0%
um if we were on the other side of the
 
06:12:10.128 --> 06:12:10.138 align:start position:0%
building I could point it out the St
 
06:12:13.310 --> 06:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
John's Church was conf um
 
06:12:13.320 --> 06:12:14.690 align:start position:0%
John's Church was conf um
on

06:12:14.690 --> 06:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:12:17.330 --> 06:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's pla or I think it's
 
06:12:19.310 --> 06:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
Pleasant Street
 
06:12:20.930 --> 06:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
um across from the federal courthouse
 
06:12:24.170 --> 06:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
building has been converted into housing
 
06:12:27.190 --> 06:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
and they were able to do that because
 
06:12:31.030 --> 06:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
the church was closed down
 
06:12:35.030 --> 06:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
completely and just rezoned but for
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
other churches where it's like okay we
 
06:12:39.948 --> 06:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
want to keep using this as a church but
 
06:12:41.868 --> 06:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
we also want to provide housing here
 
06:12:45.590 --> 06:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more ambiguity in
 
06:12:48.770 --> 06:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
that case uh like for example my church
 
06:12:48.780 --> 06:12:50.628 align:start position:0%
that case uh like for example my church
uh

06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:53.830 --> 06:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
runs this program called Family Promise
 
06:12:57.410 --> 06:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
of our church which is
 
06:13:01.070 --> 06:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
provides temporary housing for the
 
06:13:02.330 --> 06:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
homeless but
 
06:13:02.340 --> 06:13:02.990 align:start position:0%
homeless but
um

06:13:02.990 --> 06:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:06.890 --> 06:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
yeah it has to be temporary and uh we
 
06:13:09.410 --> 06:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
can't really make it anything more
 
06:13:11.750 --> 06:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
permanent for them
 
06:13:11.760 --> 06:13:13.128 align:start position:0%
permanent for them
um

06:13:13.128 --> 06:13:13.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:15.470 --> 06:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think
 
06:13:18.230 --> 06:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
just having some more clarity in this
 
06:13:19.910 --> 06:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
area about what is and what isn't
 
06:13:22.310 --> 06:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
allowed would be helpful for both
 
06:13:25.430 --> 06:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities and religious
 
06:13:25.440 --> 06:13:29.090 align:start position:0%
municipalities and religious
organizations

06:13:29.090 --> 06:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:29.100 --> 06:13:30.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:13:30.410 --> 06:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:13:32.030 --> 06:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:13:35.690 --> 06:13:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:37.850 --> 06:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir all
 
06:13:40.190 --> 06:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
06:13:52.970 --> 06:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:54.650 --> 06:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:13:56.208 --> 06:13:56.218 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
06:13:57.590 --> 06:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
once again
 
06:13:59.150 --> 06:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
by means of introduction I'm
 
06:14:01.670 --> 06:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative Maureen Mooney from the
 
06:14:03.288 --> 06:14:03.298 align:start position:0%
town of Merrimack Hillsborough County
 
06:14:06.230 --> 06:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
District number 12.
 
06:14:08.090 --> 06:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
my name is on the bill as a co-sponsor
 
06:14:10.190 --> 06:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
and I support it with the amendment that
 
06:14:13.010 --> 06:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
I've given to the chairman uh copies of
 
06:14:16.070 --> 06:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
which can be distributed it's amendment
 
06:14:16.080 --> 06:14:17.170 align:start position:0%
which can be distributed it's amendment
number

06:14:17.170 --> 06:14:17.180 align:start position:0%
number
 
06:14:23.390 --> 06:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
2023 hyphen double zero 46 h
 
06:14:27.948 --> 06:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
now House Bill 63 aims to allow the
 
06:14:30.470 --> 06:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
building of housing for the unhoused by
 
06:14:32.570 --> 06:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
a religious organization
 
06:14:34.490 --> 06:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
I think we're all in agreement that that
 
06:14:39.288 --> 06:14:39.298 align:start position:0%
last sentence of House Bill 63 that
 
06:14:43.490 --> 06:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
begins on line 9 is important and an
 
06:14:46.310 --> 06:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
exercise of religious freedom the line
 
06:14:48.048 --> 06:14:48.058 align:start position:0%
reads as follows
 
06:14:50.208 --> 06:14:50.218 align:start position:0%
the building of housing to house the
 
06:14:52.430 --> 06:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
unhoused by our religious organization
 
06:14:55.430 --> 06:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
shall qualify as religious exercise
 
06:14:58.368 --> 06:14:58.378 align:start position:0%
under this section
 
06:14:58.378 --> 06:14:59.690 align:start position:0%
under this section
however

06:14:59.690 --> 06:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:15:01.810 --> 06:15:01.820 align:start position:0%
there is a dispute about the language
 
06:15:05.690 --> 06:15:05.700 align:start position:0%
preceding that last sentence about
 
06:15:05.700 --> 06:15:07.850 align:start position:0%
preceding that last sentence about
housing

06:15:07.850 --> 06:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
housing
 
06:15:11.868 --> 06:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
my Amendment again that's 2023 hyphen
 
06:15:15.948 --> 06:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
double zero 46 H distributed to the
 
06:15:18.610 --> 06:15:18.620 align:start position:0%
chair for distribution
 
06:15:22.310 --> 06:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
preserves the carefully crafted existing
 
06:15:25.788 --> 06:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
language currently in the statute
 
06:15:29.810 --> 06:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
that came from House Bill 1021 that was
 
06:15:33.948 --> 06:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
signed into law just last year July of
 
06:15:33.958 --> 06:15:36.830 align:start position:0%
signed into law just last year July of
2022.

06:15:36.830 --> 06:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
06:15:39.530 --> 06:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
my Amendment not only preserves that
 
06:15:42.708 --> 06:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
language that was adopted last year but
 
06:15:47.270 --> 06:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
it then adds that last sentence from
 
06:15:50.448 --> 06:15:50.458 align:start position:0%
House Bill 63 about housing
 
06:15:52.250 --> 06:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
06:15:55.548 --> 06:15:55.558 align:start position:0%
so on my amendment that last sentence
 
06:16:00.048 --> 06:16:00.058 align:start position:0%
appears on line 11. again after the
 
06:16:03.350 --> 06:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
existing language that was adopted last
 
06:16:03.360 --> 06:16:04.610 align:start position:0%
existing language that was adopted last
year

06:16:04.610 --> 06:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:16:08.570 --> 06:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to adopt my Amendment
 
06:16:11.570 --> 06:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
therefore adopting the bill with that I
 
06:16:14.390 --> 06:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
will conclude my testimony thank you Mr
 
06:16:14.400 --> 06:16:16.128 align:start position:0%
will conclude my testimony thank you Mr
chairman

06:16:16.128 --> 06:16:16.138 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
questions for representative mooing
 
06:16:22.610 --> 06:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh representative mount
 
06:16:25.430 --> 06:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representative Mooney I
 
06:16:28.788 --> 06:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask I wanted to ask about
 
06:16:32.270 --> 06:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
um your Amendment and you see you have
 
06:16:34.910 --> 06:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
listed very specific
 
06:16:34.920 --> 06:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
listed very specific
um

06:16:35.990 --> 06:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:39.170 --> 06:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh requirements that a municipality or a
 
06:16:41.750 --> 06:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
town or a city could enforce and I'm
 
06:16:44.690 --> 06:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you would be open to
 
06:16:44.700 --> 06:16:45.288 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you would be open to
um

06:16:45.288 --> 06:16:45.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:47.330 --> 06:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
making it broader by stating that
 
06:16:49.490 --> 06:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
building codes are applicable municipal
 
06:16:52.610 --> 06:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
or town building codes are applicable
 
06:16:58.310 --> 06:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
rather than having this specific list of
 
06:16:58.320 --> 06:17:00.948 align:start position:0%
rather than having this specific list of
um requirements

06:17:00.948 --> 06:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
um requirements
 
06:17:01.910 --> 06:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:17:01.920 --> 06:17:03.708 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

06:17:03.708 --> 06:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:17:06.170 --> 06:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
I would be okay with that however
 
06:17:08.208 --> 06:17:08.218 align:start position:0%
we have somebody testifying probably
 
06:17:10.730 --> 06:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
immediately after me who is very
 
06:17:13.490 --> 06:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
instrumental in the original language of
 
06:17:16.670 --> 06:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1021 adopted last year
 
06:17:19.310 --> 06:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
and my guess is that that is
 
06:17:21.788 --> 06:17:21.798 align:start position:0%
specifically in there for a reason
 
06:17:25.128 --> 06:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
considering that that language just
 
06:17:27.230 --> 06:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
recently went through the process of the
 
06:17:28.490 --> 06:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate and the governor's
 
06:17:30.830 --> 06:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
signature and the like so
 
06:17:33.590 --> 06:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's my preliminary answer but I would
 
06:17:36.770 --> 06:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
ask for the full answer to come from him
 
06:17:40.128 --> 06:17:40.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:41.930 --> 06:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:17:43.670 --> 06:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
or representative Mooney so
 
06:17:46.730 --> 06:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney can I um
 
06:17:51.410 --> 06:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
can I make sure that I'm
 
06:17:51.420 --> 06:17:53.330 align:start position:0%
can I make sure that I'm
under

06:17:53.330 --> 06:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:17:56.750 --> 06:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
either the original version of the bill
 
06:17:59.090 --> 06:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
or your proposed amendment
 
06:18:01.850 --> 06:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
am I understanding and maybe this is the
 
06:18:01.860 --> 06:18:02.628 align:start position:0%
am I understanding and maybe this is the
way

06:18:02.628 --> 06:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:18:04.850 --> 06:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
the law is now under the bill that was
 
06:18:06.590 --> 06:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
passed last year but is it my
 
06:18:08.390 --> 06:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
06:18:08.400 --> 06:18:09.948 align:start position:0%
understanding that
a

06:18:09.948 --> 06:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:18:13.310 --> 06:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
a church or a really a church synagogue
 
06:18:13.320 --> 06:18:14.390 align:start position:0%
a church or a really a church synagogue
whatever

06:18:14.390 --> 06:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:18:14.400 --> 06:18:15.350 align:start position:0%
whatever
um

06:18:15.350 --> 06:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:18.948 --> 06:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:20.930 --> 06:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
in other words if for for example
 
06:18:24.650 --> 06:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
suppose that a um
 
06:18:24.660 --> 06:18:26.628 align:start position:0%
suppose that a um
in

06:18:26.628 --> 06:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:18:32.448 --> 06:18:32.458 align:start position:0%
a particular area of of some of City X
 
06:18:36.048 --> 06:18:36.058 align:start position:0%
um uh it's it's zoned residential and
 
06:18:38.930 --> 06:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
only uh either single-family houses or
 
06:18:40.788 --> 06:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
maybe single-family houses and multi
 
06:18:43.730 --> 06:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
multi-family houses are allowed but
 
06:18:47.750 --> 06:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
nothing beyond that is allowed that
 
06:18:50.810 --> 06:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
um no other
 
06:18:54.708 --> 06:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
entity that isn't a house or either a
 
06:18:56.150 --> 06:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
single-family house or a multi-family
 
06:18:57.890 --> 06:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
house would be allowed but a church
 
06:19:02.208 --> 06:19:02.218 align:start position:0%
would be allowed is that is that correct
 
06:19:05.448 --> 06:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer that also to the
 
06:19:08.150 --> 06:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
gentleman testifying after me
 
06:19:10.730 --> 06:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
because I believe that the whole impetus
 
06:19:13.850 --> 06:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
for this last year was the differences
 
06:19:16.788 --> 06:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
in various communities so this attempts
 
06:19:19.250 --> 06:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
to make it more uniform
 
06:19:21.048 --> 06:19:21.058 align:start position:0%
so I think that the answer to your
 
06:19:23.090 --> 06:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
question might be varied Community to
 
06:19:23.100 --> 06:19:24.708 align:start position:0%
question might be varied Community to
community

06:19:24.708 --> 06:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:19:29.030 --> 06:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
all right other other questions
 
06:19:30.350 --> 06:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
06:19:32.448 --> 06:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
Mooney thank you
 
06:19:32.458 --> 06:19:33.288 align:start position:0%
Mooney thank you
um

06:19:33.288 --> 06:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:42.948 --> 06:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:42.958 --> 06:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
afternoon

06:19:45.600 --> 06:19:45.610 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
06:19:45.610 --> 06:19:48.230 align:start position:0%
afternoon
[Laughter]

06:19:48.230 --> 06:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:19:51.708 --> 06:19:51.718 align:start position:0%
we love you we love your Edge microphone
 
06:19:53.868 --> 06:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
06:19:56.030 --> 06:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
my apologies good afternoon my name is
 
06:19:57.830 --> 06:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
Michael Tierney I am a practicing
 
06:20:00.650 --> 06:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
attorney I've represented a couple dozen
 
06:20:02.510 --> 06:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
religious organizations in their land
 
06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
use approvals but I'm testifying here on
 
06:20:08.208 --> 06:20:08.218 align:start position:0%
my own behalf and not on behalf of any
 
06:20:11.750 --> 06:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
particular client I work very hard with
 
06:20:13.850 --> 06:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
representative wolper last year in order
 
06:20:17.810 --> 06:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
to get HB 1021 past that is the existing
 
06:20:22.310 --> 06:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
language of RSA 670 476 and that takes
 
06:20:24.590 --> 06:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
care of what was a problem in many towns
 
06:20:26.690 --> 06:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
ran the state of having discretionary
 
06:20:29.990 --> 06:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
and arbitrary ordinances okay that would
 
06:20:32.628 --> 06:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
require religious organizations because
 
06:20:35.590 --> 06:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
they are religious to obtain additional
 
06:20:39.170 --> 06:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
greater approval based on such criteria
 
06:20:41.628 --> 06:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
such as fits within the character of the
 
06:20:44.810 --> 06:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
neighbor neighborhood okay criteria such
 
06:20:46.368 --> 06:20:46.378 align:start position:0%
as fits within the character of the
 
06:20:49.730 --> 06:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
neighborhood is a recipe for a
 
06:20:51.650 --> 06:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
subjective determination
 
06:20:54.170 --> 06:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
let me give you an example of one
 
06:20:56.510 --> 06:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
particular ordinance which I found very
 
06:20:59.448 --> 06:20:59.458 align:start position:0%
troubling in the HB 1021 last year took
 
06:21:01.128 --> 06:21:01.138 align:start position:0%
care of and that's at the town of
 
06:21:03.410 --> 06:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
Bedford has a parking ordinance that
 
06:21:05.030 --> 06:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
says that you need a certain number of
 
06:21:07.910 --> 06:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
parking spaces per square foot if you're
 
06:21:09.650 --> 06:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
a movie theater if you're gathering for
 
06:21:12.048 --> 06:21:12.058 align:start position:0%
some sort of commercial purpose
 
06:21:14.390 --> 06:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
but if you're gathering for a Christian
 
06:21:16.850 --> 06:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
purpose you're a church then you need
 
06:21:18.850 --> 06:21:18.860 align:start position:0%
more parking spaces in a movie theater
 
06:21:22.730 --> 06:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
but if God forbid you're gathering in a
 
06:21:24.650 --> 06:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
mosque the town of Bedford had an
 
06:21:26.510 --> 06:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance that you need even more
 
06:21:28.850 --> 06:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
parking Okay so
 
06:21:32.030 --> 06:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
all three of those ordinances are bad
 
06:21:34.548 --> 06:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
when you look at the fact that the
 
06:21:37.010 --> 06:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
religious nature is determining the
 
06:21:39.048 --> 06:21:39.058 align:start position:0%
parking requirement that shouldn't be
 
06:21:42.288 --> 06:21:42.298 align:start position:0%
happening in HB 1021 which was passed
 
06:21:45.830 --> 06:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
last year adopted at 674.76 took care of
 
06:21:48.730 --> 06:21:48.740 align:start position:0%
that problem and got rid of arbitrary
 
06:21:52.610 --> 06:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
discretionary ordinances okay
 
06:21:55.670 --> 06:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in a vacuum
 
06:21:58.610 --> 06:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
670 476 is based on the Massachusetts
 
06:22:02.090 --> 06:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
Dover Amendment which for 50 years
 
06:22:04.970 --> 06:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
has said that you can't have local
 
06:22:07.490 --> 06:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
zoning regulation of churches based on
 
06:22:11.510 --> 06:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
discretionary criteria but you can have
 
06:22:14.150 --> 06:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
objective and narrow criteria that are
 
06:22:16.310 --> 06:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
applied to all uses whether it be a
 
06:22:18.530 --> 06:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
church or a school or a house you know
 
06:22:20.448 --> 06:22:20.458 align:start position:0%
if you have a setback ordinance that
 
06:22:23.270 --> 06:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
says you cannot have a building within
 
06:22:25.788 --> 06:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
50 feet of a wetland okay it doesn't
 
06:22:28.190 --> 06:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
matter whether it's a school or it's a
 
06:22:30.170 --> 06:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
church or it's a house if you have to be
 
06:22:31.850 --> 06:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
50 feet back from Wetland you have to be
 
06:22:33.770 --> 06:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
50 feet back from wetland
 
06:22:36.890 --> 06:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
what this statute that was adopted last
 
06:22:39.410 --> 06:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
year got rid of was saying that if
 
06:22:42.470 --> 06:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
you're a movie theater you have to be 50
 
06:22:45.230 --> 06:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
feet back from a uh Wetland if you're a
 
06:22:46.970 --> 06:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
church you need to be 100 feet back from
 
06:22:48.890 --> 06:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
Wetland and if you're a musk you need to
 
06:22:51.170 --> 06:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
be 150 feet back from Wetland okay
 
06:22:56.350 --> 06:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's what 674 76 does
 
06:23:00.530 --> 06:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
hb63 which is before you is a bad bill
 
06:23:02.628 --> 06:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
um I oppose it I oppose it because all
 
06:23:04.430 --> 06:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
of the problems
 
06:23:07.368 --> 06:23:07.378 align:start position:0%
um that the current statute was intended
 
06:23:09.470 --> 06:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
to get rid of could happen
 
06:23:13.730 --> 06:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
if you look at the language of hb63 okay
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
you need to show that the soul the sole
 
06:23:20.030 --> 06:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
reason why the municipality is
 
06:23:21.890 --> 06:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
regulating something is because of its
 
06:23:25.610 --> 06:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
religious nature so a town
 
06:23:28.190 --> 06:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
could say we're regulating the parking
 
06:23:30.470 --> 06:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose isn't solely religious
 
06:23:33.948 --> 06:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
nature therefore we can have as part of
 
06:23:36.230 --> 06:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
the basis that a church has to have this
 
06:23:37.970 --> 06:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
parking ordinance Hamas needs to have
 
06:23:39.350 --> 06:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
that parking ordinance a movie theater
 
06:23:41.390 --> 06:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
has to have whatever other parking
 
06:23:41.400 --> 06:23:44.208 align:start position:0%
has to have whatever other parking
ordinance

06:23:44.208 --> 06:23:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:47.030 --> 06:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
the current law which has only been in
 
06:23:49.190 --> 06:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
place for a matter of months is a good
 
06:23:52.250 --> 06:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
law it should stay that language should
 
06:23:56.690 --> 06:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
not be repealed as is proposed by hb63
 
06:23:58.490 --> 06:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
as introduced
 
06:23:58.500 --> 06:24:00.770 align:start position:0%
as introduced
um

06:24:00.770 --> 06:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:04.850 --> 06:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
the second section of hb63 has what's
 
06:24:06.470 --> 06:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
called substantial burden language
 
06:24:09.770 --> 06:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
substantial burden language has been
 
06:24:11.690 --> 06:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
adopted in States all across the country
 
06:24:13.850 --> 06:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
maybe in 30 different states
 
06:24:16.368 --> 06:24:16.378 align:start position:0%
and it requires a religious organization
 
06:24:18.890 --> 06:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
to show that it has exhausted all
 
06:24:18.900 --> 06:24:20.150 align:start position:0%
to show that it has exhausted all
alternatives

06:24:20.150 --> 06:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
06:24:23.150 --> 06:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
prior to being able to use its own
 
06:24:25.610 --> 06:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
property for religious purposes such as
 
06:24:27.530 --> 06:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
housing and housed having religious
 
06:24:29.208 --> 06:24:29.218 align:start position:0%
worship services having a religious
 
06:24:35.330 --> 06:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
school okay so that language is not very
 
06:24:38.030 --> 06:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
helpful to making sure that we have a
 
06:24:39.530 --> 06:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
protection of religious liberty here in
 
06:24:42.830 --> 06:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it is also an invitation
 
06:24:44.030 --> 06:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
to litigation
 
06:24:47.830 --> 06:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
I can cite thousands literally thousands
 
06:24:50.510 --> 06:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
of cases where towns and religious
 
06:24:53.090 --> 06:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
organizations have litigated what it
 
06:24:55.910 --> 06:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
means to be a substantial burden the U.S
 
06:24:58.368 --> 06:24:58.378 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court hasn't decided that
 
06:24:59.990 --> 06:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
um 10 different circuits around the
 
06:25:01.310 --> 06:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
country have come up with different
 
06:25:03.350 --> 06:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
definitions and tests and how to
 
06:25:05.510 --> 06:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
determine a substantial burden and it is
 
06:25:08.350 --> 06:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
just an invitation for Unnecessary
 
06:25:10.670 --> 06:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
costly and time-consuming litigation
 
06:25:13.670 --> 06:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
over whether this particular proposal is
 
06:25:15.170 --> 06:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
a substantial burden
 
06:25:18.288 --> 06:25:18.298 align:start position:0%
the existing language is clear it's easy
 
06:25:19.970 --> 06:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
to apply
 
06:25:23.448 --> 06:25:23.458 align:start position:0%
um and it could be improved by adding
 
06:25:25.430 --> 06:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
um representative Mooney's Amendment
 
06:25:27.650 --> 06:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
which makes clear that housing the
 
06:25:30.410 --> 06:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
unhoused is religious exercise I heard
 
06:25:32.810 --> 06:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Gallagher is also
 
06:25:35.448 --> 06:25:35.458 align:start position:0%
in support of that Amendment taking the
 
06:25:38.810 --> 06:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
existing language and just adding as a
 
06:25:42.110 --> 06:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
final sentence a clarification okay that
 
06:25:45.350 --> 06:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
religious exercise also includes housing
 
06:25:47.930 --> 06:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
the unhoused
 
06:25:49.548 --> 06:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
um if there are any questions I'd be
 
06:25:52.010 --> 06:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
06:25:54.530 --> 06:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
um about hb63 or about current law and
 
06:25:55.970 --> 06:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
how it all works
 
06:26:00.548 --> 06:26:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:03.350 --> 06:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tripp thank you Mr
 
06:26:04.910 --> 06:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:26:04.920 --> 06:26:05.628 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

06:26:05.628 --> 06:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:26:08.390 --> 06:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
so uh essentially what uh
 
06:26:11.270 --> 06:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
what what this bill is doing is uh uh
 
06:26:15.230 --> 06:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
stripping out anyhow Sony regulations in
 
06:26:17.150 --> 06:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
the town right
 
06:26:20.150 --> 06:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about hb63
 
06:26:28.910 --> 06:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:31.970 --> 06:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um other questions
 
06:26:34.850 --> 06:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
so I I have a couple of questions uh uh
 
06:26:36.650 --> 06:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
Mr Jimmy if I could so am I
 
06:26:38.770 --> 06:26:38.780 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly then that
 
06:26:41.810 --> 06:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
are you okay with representative
 
06:26:44.330 --> 06:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
Mooney's proposed amendment yes yes the
 
06:26:47.090 --> 06:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
way it's rewarded yes all right so my
 
06:26:49.430 --> 06:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
question is this
 
06:26:53.510 --> 06:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
um let's put aside any version of the of
 
06:26:55.490 --> 06:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
63 whether it's the original or the
 
06:26:58.368 --> 06:26:58.378 align:start position:0%
amendment under the existing law as it
 
06:27:00.170 --> 06:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
was changed last year
 
06:27:00.180 --> 06:27:02.410 align:start position:0%
was changed last year
if

06:27:02.410 --> 06:27:02.420 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:27:07.570 --> 06:27:07.580 align:start position:0%
zoning in a particular area says
 
06:27:09.970 --> 06:27:09.980 align:start position:0%
single family houses
 
06:27:13.128 --> 06:27:13.138 align:start position:0%
or mult or let's say you know duplexes
 
06:27:15.288 --> 06:27:15.298 align:start position:0%
or single-family houses or duplexes or
 
06:27:19.010 --> 06:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
triplexes okay that's it nothing else
 
06:27:22.610 --> 06:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
can a church be located there under
 
06:27:26.510 --> 06:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
existing law as it is today okay if the
 
06:27:28.850 --> 06:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
exclusion of churches is because it is a
 
06:27:31.128 --> 06:27:31.138 align:start position:0%
church and not a house that is not
 
06:27:33.770 --> 06:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
permissible under existing law if the
 
06:27:35.810 --> 06:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
exclusion is because the zoning
 
06:27:37.788 --> 06:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
ordinance does not allow structures over
 
06:27:40.548 --> 06:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
five thousand square feet
 
06:27:42.530 --> 06:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
um then that exclusion would be
 
06:27:44.930 --> 06:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
permissible but an exclusion based on
 
06:27:47.330 --> 06:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
religious purpose is not permissible it
 
06:27:49.128 --> 06:27:49.138 align:start position:0%
needs to be on objective criteria such
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
as size but for example for I guess what
 
06:27:53.868 --> 06:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
I would be asking I mean for example
 
06:27:58.250 --> 06:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
suppose that the that the
 
06:28:00.590 --> 06:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
The Zone the purpose of the zoning
 
06:28:02.810 --> 06:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
ordinance is in other words
 
06:28:06.230 --> 06:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
single-family houses or or let's say a a
 
06:28:08.330 --> 06:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
Triplex is you're gonna there's a
 
06:28:10.548 --> 06:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
certain limitation on the number of
 
06:28:10.558 --> 06:28:11.868 align:start position:0%
certain limitation on the number of
people

06:28:11.868 --> 06:28:11.878 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:28:14.690 --> 06:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
that are that are you know I mean in a
 
06:28:16.548 --> 06:28:16.558 align:start position:0%
single family house you generally it
 
06:28:19.368 --> 06:28:19.378 align:start position:0%
would be quite unusual to have 25 people
 
06:28:21.530 --> 06:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
living in a single family house and so I
 
06:28:25.010 --> 06:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:27.530 --> 06:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
a church is I I guess what I'm saying is
 
06:28:30.890 --> 06:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
a church is not a house and so it you
 
06:28:31.970 --> 06:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
seem to be saying that that doesn't
 
06:28:34.128 --> 06:28:34.138 align:start position:0%
matter so that doesn't matter let me
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
give you an example okay an example in
 
06:28:38.868 --> 06:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
the town of Hanover right now there's
 
06:28:41.930 --> 06:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
litigation that's pending okay regarding
 
06:28:44.448 --> 06:28:44.458 align:start position:0%
a church that is trying to obtain
 
06:28:47.208 --> 06:28:47.218 align:start position:0%
permission to build okay in what is
 
06:28:49.070 --> 06:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
deemed a residential area because
 
06:28:50.750 --> 06:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
they're not able to or allowed to build
 
06:28:53.750 --> 06:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere else okay and one of the things
 
06:28:56.390 --> 06:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
that the zoning board has restricted and
 
06:28:59.270 --> 06:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
regulated is whether you can have a
 
06:29:01.910 --> 06:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
Bible study for six to ten people now
 
06:29:03.830 --> 06:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
whether a Bible study for six to ten
 
06:29:06.830 --> 06:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
people happens in my living room or
 
06:29:09.410 --> 06:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
happens in a church basement it's the
 
06:29:11.150 --> 06:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
same six to ten people
 
06:29:14.030 --> 06:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay and the town should not be given
 
06:29:18.590 --> 06:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
the power to regulate the time the hours
 
06:29:22.250 --> 06:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
or the day based on the religious nature
 
06:29:24.830 --> 06:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
now if a town has an ordinance based on
 
06:29:27.850 --> 06:29:27.860 align:start position:0%
number of people size of structure
 
06:29:30.530 --> 06:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
setbacks all those objective criteria
 
06:29:32.390 --> 06:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're all permissible under existing
 
06:29:32.400 --> 06:29:33.470 align:start position:0%
they're all permissible under existing
law

06:29:33.470 --> 06:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:29:36.350 --> 06:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
but it's not permissible to exclude
 
06:29:38.510 --> 06:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
something based on its religious purpose
 
06:29:42.170 --> 06:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
right okay okay so let me just ask what
 
06:29:44.390 --> 06:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
follow does this
 
06:29:47.030 --> 06:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering if the language the
 
06:29:48.830 --> 06:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
language in representative Mooney's
 
06:29:50.930 --> 06:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment the the language that
 
06:29:53.030 --> 06:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
starts provided
 
06:29:55.730 --> 06:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if the
 
06:29:57.650 --> 06:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
if the
 
06:30:00.530 --> 06:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
language there that says these kind of
 
06:30:03.530 --> 06:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
regulations are okay and can be applied
 
06:30:06.590 --> 06:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
to a religious Institution
 
06:30:08.330 --> 06:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
are they
 
06:30:11.150 --> 06:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
more limited than what exists under
 
06:30:14.868 --> 06:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
current law no that is exactly identical
 
06:30:17.930 --> 06:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
to current law okay current law lists
 
06:30:20.868 --> 06:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
the um height of structures yard sizes
 
06:30:23.270 --> 06:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
lot area setbacks open space building
 
06:30:26.270 --> 06:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
coverage requirements okay that is
 
06:30:29.090 --> 06:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
existing law and as long as those
 
06:30:32.150 --> 06:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
objective criteria are applied to uh
 
06:30:34.490 --> 06:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
movie theaters or churches or synagogues
 
06:30:37.250 --> 06:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
or Moss those objective criteria can
 
06:30:38.868 --> 06:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
continue to be applied you just can't
 
06:30:42.110 --> 06:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
have criteria especially for religious
 
06:30:42.120 --> 06:30:45.048 align:start position:0%
have criteria especially for religious
purposes

06:30:45.048 --> 06:30:45.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:46.970 --> 06:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
I want to just ask one one other
 
06:30:48.470 --> 06:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
question to make sure I'm gonna so
 
06:30:51.048 --> 06:30:51.058 align:start position:0%
suppose that we're talking suppose that
 
06:30:54.590 --> 06:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh a zoning area is single family houses
 
06:30:57.170 --> 06:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
only okay right
 
06:31:01.010 --> 06:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
and a a religious organization wants to
 
06:31:04.310 --> 06:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
build on its property Apartments
 
06:31:06.590 --> 06:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh with a greater density can they do
 
06:31:06.600 --> 06:31:07.610 align:start position:0%
uh with a greater density can they do
that

06:31:07.610 --> 06:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:31:11.150 --> 06:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
so under the Mooney Amendment my
 
06:31:13.570 --> 06:31:13.580 align:start position:0%
understanding is that religious exercise
 
06:31:16.548 --> 06:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
includes providing services to the
 
06:31:19.730 --> 06:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
homeless it doesn't include providing
 
06:31:19.740 --> 06:31:21.770 align:start position:0%
homeless it doesn't include providing
Apartments

06:31:21.770 --> 06:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
Apartments
 
06:31:23.208 --> 06:31:23.218 align:start position:0%
um you know at two thousand dollars a
 
06:31:26.090 --> 06:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
month that is not included under the
 
06:31:28.788 --> 06:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
Mooney amendment in my understanding oh
 
06:31:30.708 --> 06:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
well okay so let me change my question a
 
06:31:32.990 --> 06:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
little bit so if the if a really in a
 
06:31:35.628 --> 06:31:35.638 align:start position:0%
single family zoning area if a religious
 
06:31:39.650 --> 06:31:39.660 align:start position:0%
institution wanted to provide Apartments
 
06:31:43.310 --> 06:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
to house the homeless in that zoning
 
06:31:46.190 --> 06:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
area would that be allowed
 
06:31:48.830 --> 06:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
it would not be able to be excluded
 
06:31:51.230 --> 06:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
because of the religious purpose if
 
06:31:53.750 --> 06:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
there was a density or a height or a
 
06:31:55.070 --> 06:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
setback or if there was some other
 
06:31:58.190 --> 06:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
reason to forbid it that could be
 
06:32:00.230 --> 06:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
forbidden by some other reason but not
 
06:32:01.788 --> 06:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
the religious purpose
 
06:32:04.730 --> 06:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
06:32:04.740 --> 06:32:07.190 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
Witness

06:32:07.190 --> 06:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:08.990 --> 06:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry yes the representative
 
06:32:09.000 --> 06:32:11.270 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry yes the representative
Perez

06:32:11.270 --> 06:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
Perez
 
06:32:13.730 --> 06:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:32:15.890 --> 06:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
the building of housing to house the
 
06:32:19.430 --> 06:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
unhoused by allergist organization shall
 
06:32:22.730 --> 06:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
qualify as religious exercise under this
 
06:32:22.740 --> 06:32:24.110 align:start position:0%
qualify as religious exercise under this
section

06:32:24.110 --> 06:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
section
 
06:32:28.190 --> 06:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
who determines that who determined that
 
06:32:31.070 --> 06:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
housing the unhouses
 
06:32:33.830 --> 06:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
housed and pardon my ignorance is a
 
06:32:37.250 --> 06:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
religious exercise that would be this
 
06:32:37.260 --> 06:32:38.048 align:start position:0%
religious exercise that would be this
body

06:32:38.048 --> 06:32:38.058 align:start position:0%
body
 
06:32:42.350 --> 06:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
this body is writing into law a
 
06:32:44.570 --> 06:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
clarification that the housing of the
 
06:32:46.730 --> 06:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
unhoused is religious exercise do we
 
06:32:49.310 --> 06:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
already may I do we already have
 
06:32:52.910 --> 06:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
something that states that so I don't
 
06:32:54.890 --> 06:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
believe there's anything in existing law
 
06:32:57.048 --> 06:32:57.058 align:start position:0%
that states that I know there are
 
06:32:59.690 --> 06:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
existing cases around the country that
 
06:33:02.810 --> 06:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
are about 90 percent that the services
 
06:33:05.390 --> 06:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
to the homeless can qualify as religious
 
06:33:07.788 --> 06:33:07.798 align:start position:0%
exercise but there are some outliers
 
06:33:10.010 --> 06:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
that say that services to the homeless
 
06:33:12.590 --> 06:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
unchurched properties cannot qualify as
 
06:33:15.770 --> 06:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
a realtor exercise AI yes so
 
06:33:19.610 --> 06:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
this is not only changing things about
 
06:33:21.650 --> 06:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
the structures I understand that that's
 
06:33:24.230 --> 06:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
pretty clear but it is also
 
06:33:27.170 --> 06:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
adding the fact that
 
06:33:30.530 --> 06:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
housing the unhoused is a religious
 
06:33:32.930 --> 06:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
exercise that is the purpose of the
 
06:33:34.850 --> 06:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
money amendment is my understanding yes
 
06:33:37.788 --> 06:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative page thank
 
06:33:39.048 --> 06:33:39.058 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:33:39.058 --> 06:33:40.368 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

06:33:40.368 --> 06:33:40.378 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:33:43.490 --> 06:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
um this is on that last sentence with us
 
06:33:45.590 --> 06:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
determining what's a religious exercise
 
06:33:47.628 --> 06:33:47.638 align:start position:0%
do you find that problematic at all from
 
06:33:51.410 --> 06:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:53.810 --> 06:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
06:33:57.650 --> 06:33:57.660 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that the state can
 
06:34:00.410 --> 06:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
determine what is and is not religious
 
06:34:02.330 --> 06:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
exercise I think that is a huge
 
06:34:05.150 --> 06:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem but the state can
 
06:34:07.430 --> 06:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
determine what is and is not really
 
06:34:09.110 --> 06:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
sexualized for the purpose of
 
06:34:11.330 --> 06:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
restricting the powers of attack
 
06:34:14.208 --> 06:34:14.218 align:start position:0%
so if this was saying that this is
 
06:34:16.190 --> 06:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
religious exercise in church you must do
 
06:34:16.200 --> 06:34:16.910 align:start position:0%
religious exercise in church you must do
this

06:34:16.910 --> 06:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:34:19.788 --> 06:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
that would be a big problem but this is
 
06:34:22.010 --> 06:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
a restriction on the town's restriction
 
06:34:24.410 --> 06:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
on churches which
 
06:34:26.090 --> 06:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if I'm making this health
 
06:34:27.770 --> 06:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
clear but because it's a restriction on
 
06:34:30.048 --> 06:34:30.058 align:start position:0%
Municipal Power it's not a restriction
 
06:34:32.810 --> 06:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
on a a religious organization's
 
06:34:36.590 --> 06:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:39.590 --> 06:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative Horgan
 
06:34:42.410 --> 06:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
yes but we would agree
 
06:34:44.390 --> 06:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
that the current law and I guess this
 
06:34:46.430 --> 06:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
bill too you would you would provide
 
06:34:46.440 --> 06:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
bill too you would you would provide
different

06:34:47.270 --> 06:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:34:49.368 --> 06:34:49.378 align:start position:0%
um protections to
 
06:34:51.530 --> 06:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
organizations that hold say they're
 
06:34:53.270 --> 06:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
religious as opposed to organizations
 
06:34:56.448 --> 06:34:56.458 align:start position:0%
that are explicitly non-religious or sex
 
06:34:59.930 --> 06:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
or or a secular
 
06:35:02.810 --> 06:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
like say you know like you're maybe
 
06:35:04.368 --> 06:35:04.378 align:start position:0%
you're talking about like you know
 
06:35:06.470 --> 06:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
having six to ten people and doing their
 
06:35:09.230 --> 06:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
Bible study in the church basement but
 
06:35:11.448 --> 06:35:11.458 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't apply say to six to ten
 
06:35:13.070 --> 06:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
people like playing Dungeons and Dragons
 
06:35:14.930 --> 06:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
in their Dungeons and dragon Club
 
06:35:16.730 --> 06:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
basement if they had one
 
06:35:20.150 --> 06:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm not aware of a single town in the
 
06:35:22.070 --> 06:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that regulates
 
06:35:24.708 --> 06:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
the playing of dungeons of dragons or
 
06:35:24.718 --> 06:35:26.208 align:start position:0%
the playing of dungeons of dragons or
regulates

06:35:26.208 --> 06:35:26.218 align:start position:0%
regulates
 
06:35:28.190 --> 06:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
um activities based on the secular
 
06:35:30.708 --> 06:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
nature I am unfortunately aware of
 
06:35:33.650 --> 06:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
dozens of towns that regulate based on
 
06:35:36.350 --> 06:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
the religious nature and make a
 
06:35:37.970 --> 06:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
determination that the government is
 
06:35:40.310 --> 06:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to impose greater restrictions
 
06:35:43.010 --> 06:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
even based on the form of religious
 
06:35:43.020 --> 06:35:45.350 align:start position:0%
even based on the form of religious
worship

06:35:45.350 --> 06:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
worship
 
06:35:48.288 --> 06:35:48.298 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
06:35:51.048 --> 06:35:51.058 align:start position:0%
yeah um I you may have tried to touch on
 
06:35:52.190 --> 06:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
this but I'm looking at the difference
 
06:35:55.548 --> 06:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
between the uh House Bill 63 versus the
 
06:35:57.948 --> 06:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
existing language and and provision
 
06:36:01.250 --> 06:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one online four four and
 
06:36:04.430 --> 06:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
five says what I think you've been
 
06:36:06.170 --> 06:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
saying or I'm interpreting it that way
 
06:36:10.430 --> 06:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
it says uh no ordinances Etc
 
06:36:12.410 --> 06:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
um shall restrict the use of Land
 
06:36:14.448 --> 06:36:14.458 align:start position:0%
restructures Based solely the word
 
06:36:17.150 --> 06:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
solely on the religious nature of the
 
06:36:18.770 --> 06:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
use and it sounded like that's what
 
06:36:20.330 --> 06:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
you've been supporting is that it
 
06:36:22.970 --> 06:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be based solely on the
 
06:36:25.368 --> 06:36:25.378 align:start position:0%
religious nature of the use
 
06:36:25.378 --> 06:36:26.110 align:start position:0%
religious nature of the use
um

06:36:26.110 --> 06:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:29.690 --> 06:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
the existing language actually talks
 
06:36:32.208 --> 06:36:32.218 align:start position:0%
more about the use of the structure
 
06:36:35.090 --> 06:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
and it says basically restrict the use
 
06:36:37.910 --> 06:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
of land or structures primarily used for
 
06:36:40.010 --> 06:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
religious purposes so it seems like
 
06:36:41.948 --> 06:36:41.958 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly big difference between
 
06:36:45.110 --> 06:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
what the existing language says versus
 
06:36:47.448 --> 06:36:47.458 align:start position:0%
the new language and it sounds like the
 
06:36:48.708 --> 06:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
new language at least that first
 
06:36:51.288 --> 06:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
provision is closer to what it sounds
 
06:36:53.770 --> 06:36:53.780 align:start position:0%
like you're supporting is that accurate
 
06:36:57.708 --> 06:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
that isn't accurate the the newly
 
06:36:59.930 --> 06:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
proposed language that has the phrase
 
06:37:02.810 --> 06:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
solely okay is
 
06:37:02.820 --> 06:37:04.090 align:start position:0%
solely okay is
um

06:37:04.090 --> 06:37:04.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:08.510 --> 06:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
problematic because of the potential in
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
the everyday experience that you have
 
06:37:13.070 --> 06:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
activities happening at religious
 
06:37:16.070 --> 06:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
properties okay that an outside Observer
 
06:37:18.350 --> 06:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
could say well that isn't solely for
 
06:37:21.590 --> 06:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
this purpose we have this other area
 
06:37:25.010 --> 06:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
um um where we intended as well so let
 
06:37:27.048 --> 06:37:27.058 align:start position:0%
me go back to my Bedford parking example
 
06:37:29.410 --> 06:37:29.420 align:start position:0%
when they have an ordinance that is
 
06:37:33.288 --> 06:37:33.298 align:start position:0%
restricting parking at mosques more than
 
06:37:35.750 --> 06:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's restricting parking at churches
 
06:37:38.570 --> 06:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
okay that wouldn't be prohibited because
 
06:37:40.490 --> 06:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's not based solely on the religious
 
06:37:44.270 --> 06:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
nature it's based primarily on the
 
06:37:46.250 --> 06:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
religious nature but it's also based on
 
06:37:47.628 --> 06:37:47.638 align:start position:0%
the town's interest in making sure
 
06:37:49.430 --> 06:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's sufficient parking and the town
 
06:37:50.930 --> 06:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
does have an interest in making sure
 
06:37:53.270 --> 06:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
there's sufficient parking but they
 
06:37:56.090 --> 06:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
can't be doing it based primarily
 
06:37:58.730 --> 06:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
on distinctions between religious groups
 
06:38:01.670 --> 06:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why primarily is more
 
06:38:04.670 --> 06:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
protective than solely
 
06:38:07.430 --> 06:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
just one quick follow-up so in the
 
06:38:11.150 --> 06:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
example that you had given before is it
 
06:38:15.170 --> 06:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
the case that if you could show that
 
06:38:17.750 --> 06:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
the interest is not parking because
 
06:38:19.850 --> 06:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
you've got one group that's allowed six
 
06:38:22.190 --> 06:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
bases and one group that's allowed more
 
06:38:24.650 --> 06:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
but the only difference is
 
06:38:27.890 --> 06:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
the religious component isn't that Soul
 
06:38:29.208 --> 06:38:29.218 align:start position:0%
isn't that the word where the word
 
06:38:31.368 --> 06:38:31.378 align:start position:0%
solely does come in
 
06:38:34.788 --> 06:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
so the word solely comes in from and I'm
 
06:38:36.590 --> 06:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
going to pronounce it wrong but a U.S
 
06:38:37.910 --> 06:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case of the Church of
 
06:38:41.150 --> 06:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
lukumi babalai okay and in the Church of
 
06:38:43.730 --> 06:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
lakumi babalai the church needed to
 
06:38:46.128 --> 06:38:46.138 align:start position:0%
prove okay that the real basis for the
 
06:38:49.208 --> 06:38:49.218 align:start position:0%
town's ordinance was anti-santiary
 
06:38:51.770 --> 06:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
animus that discrimination okay the
 
06:38:53.750 --> 06:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
church needed to prove that needed to
 
06:38:55.850 --> 06:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
prove that in a lawsuit that went up all
 
06:38:57.410 --> 06:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
the way the U.S Supreme Court took a
 
06:38:58.730 --> 06:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
number of years cost hundreds of
 
06:39:00.350 --> 06:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars both for the city
 
06:39:03.410 --> 06:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
and for the for the church okay
 
06:39:03.420 --> 06:39:04.810 align:start position:0%
and for the for the church okay
um

06:39:04.810 --> 06:39:04.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:07.548 --> 06:39:07.558 align:start position:0%
if you have language such as current
 
06:39:11.270 --> 06:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
existing law primarily okay then there's
 
06:39:14.030 --> 06:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
no need to show that the one and only
 
06:39:16.970 --> 06:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
purpose of the town is its religious
 
06:39:18.530 --> 06:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
discrimination that they don't have any
 
06:39:20.990 --> 06:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
other no if it's primarily for a
 
06:39:22.610 --> 06:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
religious purpose
 
06:39:25.250 --> 06:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
um then that takes that confusion
 
06:39:28.430 --> 06:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
um and that litigation out of the
 
06:39:30.590 --> 06:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
um out of the mix
 
06:39:33.230 --> 06:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
um solely is enshrining
 
06:39:35.570 --> 06:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
um First Amendment jurisprudence
 
06:39:37.970 --> 06:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and so the statute does nothing more
 
06:39:39.230 --> 06:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
than the Constitution under the first
 
06:39:40.850 --> 06:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
member already does
 
06:39:42.948 --> 06:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
all right representative Tripp I think
 
06:39:44.810 --> 06:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
you had a question
 
06:39:46.910 --> 06:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
06:39:48.430 --> 06:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:39:52.548 --> 06:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
uh you said that uh this language is uh
 
06:39:55.070 --> 06:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
language it was used last year in uh
 
06:39:59.990 --> 06:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 1024 10 21 10 21. oh that's
 
06:40:02.570 --> 06:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
my poor handwriting uh
 
06:40:06.170 --> 06:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
so uh so that uh
 
06:40:08.330 --> 06:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
they're they're can I assume that
 
06:40:10.128 --> 06:40:10.138 align:start position:0%
there's a church that has built housing
 
06:40:11.948 --> 06:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
on its property
 
06:40:11.958 --> 06:40:13.490 align:start position:0%
on its property
no

06:40:13.490 --> 06:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:40:16.850 --> 06:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
um the addition of the housing language
 
06:40:19.610 --> 06:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
um is not part of HB 1021
 
06:40:21.590 --> 06:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
um that is what was being proposed by
 
06:40:22.788 --> 06:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher and
 
06:40:24.770 --> 06:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney here today
 
06:40:27.650 --> 06:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
okay the clarification that housing on
 
06:40:30.470 --> 06:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
Church properties is what is new
 
06:40:33.890 --> 06:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
1021 is everything before that final
 
06:40:36.350 --> 06:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
sentence in representative Moody's
 
06:40:36.360 --> 06:40:38.390 align:start position:0%
sentence in representative Moody's
um

06:40:38.390 --> 06:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:40.788 --> 06:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh proposed amendment all right well
 
06:40:43.430 --> 06:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I understand now
 
06:40:45.230 --> 06:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
another question yes uh representative
 
06:40:45.240 --> 06:40:46.670 align:start position:0%
another question yes uh representative
Mass

06:40:46.670 --> 06:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
Mass
 
06:40:48.708 --> 06:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:40:48.718 --> 06:40:50.090 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

06:40:50.090 --> 06:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:40:53.990 --> 06:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I asked a representative Mooney about
 
06:40:57.590 --> 06:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
her view on broadening
 
06:41:01.868 --> 06:41:01.878 align:start position:0%
her amendment to include building codes
 
06:41:05.868 --> 06:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
municipal or city building codes and I'm
 
06:41:08.628 --> 06:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
wondering what your view on that is so
 
06:41:11.390 --> 06:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
my view is number one the state building
 
06:41:14.750 --> 06:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
code is not impacted by existing law the
 
06:41:18.310 --> 06:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
state building code is already
 
06:41:20.810 --> 06:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
able to be applied to churches just like
 
06:41:22.368 --> 06:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
it's be able to be applied to movie
 
06:41:24.410 --> 06:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
theaters or houses or what have you okay
 
06:41:27.350 --> 06:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
now when a municipality comes up with
 
06:41:29.990 --> 06:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
their own additions to the building code
 
06:41:32.590 --> 06:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
um it would be my view that if those
 
06:41:35.090 --> 06:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
additions to the building code are
 
06:41:37.970 --> 06:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
objective and definite that that
 
06:41:41.570 --> 06:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a problem it would only be a
 
06:41:41.580 --> 06:41:42.708 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a problem it would only be a
problem

06:41:42.708 --> 06:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:41:44.390 --> 06:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
um if they were subjective and
 
06:41:46.490 --> 06:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
discretionary okay so a building
 
06:41:49.548 --> 06:41:49.558 align:start position:0%
provision that said that you need to
 
06:41:49.558 --> 06:41:50.570 align:start position:0%
provision that said that you need to
have

06:41:50.570 --> 06:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:41:53.990 --> 06:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
excise trusses for why size you know
 
06:41:55.850 --> 06:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
weight great you know those are going to
 
06:41:57.948 --> 06:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
be applicable regardless of building
 
06:42:00.590 --> 06:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
code that says that appropriate
 
06:42:04.070 --> 06:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
provision or adequate ventilation or
 
06:42:07.548 --> 06:42:07.558 align:start position:0%
those sorts of discretionary terms are
 
06:42:11.330 --> 06:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
exactly why HB 1021 was adopted last
 
06:42:13.850 --> 06:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
year so you don't have discretionary
 
06:42:15.830 --> 06:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement against religious
 
06:42:19.128 --> 06:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
organizations so if it said objective
 
06:42:20.990 --> 06:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
and definite
 
06:42:21.000 --> 06:42:22.690 align:start position:0%
and definite
uh

06:42:22.690 --> 06:42:22.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:42:27.830 --> 06:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
municipal or or city building codes you
 
06:42:27.840 --> 06:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
municipal or or city building codes you
would

06:42:29.030 --> 06:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:42:31.010 --> 06:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
be okay with that
 
06:42:33.708 --> 06:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
I I personally would be okay with that
 
06:42:35.930 --> 06:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
okay the other thing I wanted to ask if
 
06:42:37.250 --> 06:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
I make yes
 
06:42:37.260 --> 06:42:38.510 align:start position:0%
I make yes
um

06:42:38.510 --> 06:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:41.150 --> 06:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment says do not does not
 
06:42:44.628 --> 06:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
substantially burden religious exercise
 
06:42:46.788 --> 06:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
who would it be the town or the
 
06:42:50.208 --> 06:42:50.218 align:start position:0%
municipality or the city that is in the
 
06:42:52.490 --> 06:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
positioning in the position of
 
06:42:54.288 --> 06:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not it
 
06:42:57.770 --> 06:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
substantially burdens religious exercise
 
06:43:00.470 --> 06:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
great question there is a lot of
 
06:43:03.650 --> 06:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
litigation on exactly whose burden it is
 
06:43:06.590 --> 06:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
um and the cases are split
 
06:43:10.310 --> 06:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
um the relupa federal law okay places
 
06:43:14.150 --> 06:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
the burden in the first instance on the
 
06:43:16.970 --> 06:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
church and then places the burden under
 
06:43:20.750 --> 06:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny on the tap okay and that
 
06:43:22.910 --> 06:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
conflicting burden is applied
 
06:43:24.650 --> 06:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
differently in the first circuit that is
 
06:43:26.030 --> 06:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
in the 10th circuit that ends in the
 
06:43:27.650 --> 06:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
sixth circuit
 
06:43:30.830 --> 06:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to specify who has
 
06:43:32.750 --> 06:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
the burden that the religious
 
06:43:35.090 --> 06:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
organization has the burden I would be
 
06:43:37.430 --> 06:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about putting a municipality
 
06:43:41.628 --> 06:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
or a city in the position of making a
 
06:43:46.490 --> 06:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
judgment or evaluating whether there's a
 
06:43:50.288 --> 06:43:50.298 align:start position:0%
substantial burden on religious exercise
 
06:43:54.890 --> 06:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
so I would not be opposed to clarifying
 
06:43:56.868 --> 06:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
that the church needs to make proof of
 
06:43:58.368 --> 06:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
its substantial burden in the first
 
06:43:58.378 --> 06:43:59.690 align:start position:0%
its substantial burden in the first
instance

06:43:59.690 --> 06:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
instance
 
06:44:01.970 --> 06:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
um but it is the typical practice that
 
06:44:04.850 --> 06:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
the church makes a representation that
 
06:44:07.190 --> 06:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
is a substantial burden and the city
 
06:44:10.010 --> 06:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
says no it's not a substantial burden
 
06:44:13.570 --> 06:44:13.580 align:start position:0%
because you could do it this other way
 
06:44:16.610 --> 06:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
and whether they could or could not do
 
06:44:19.190 --> 06:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
it this other way is sort of where a lot
 
06:44:21.128 --> 06:44:21.138 align:start position:0%
of the fights get into
 
06:44:25.670 --> 06:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
which is why having objective indefinite
 
06:44:28.788 --> 06:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
setbacks Heights those sorts of things
 
06:44:28.798 --> 06:44:29.810 align:start position:0%
setbacks Heights those sorts of things
um

06:44:29.810 --> 06:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:33.110 --> 06:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
avoids all that unnecessary litigation
 
06:44:35.090 --> 06:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
06:44:35.100 --> 06:44:36.650 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
Witness

06:44:36.650 --> 06:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
06:44:39.110 --> 06:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you oh I'm
 
06:44:40.788 --> 06:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
sorry yes representative I'm sorry I'm
 
06:44:45.048 --> 06:44:45.058 align:start position:0%
sorry I I really like the intent of that
 
06:44:46.970 --> 06:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
last sentence and and I just wanted to
 
06:44:48.530 --> 06:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
Circle back one more time and try one
 
06:44:51.230 --> 06:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
more question again around what I what I
 
06:44:53.030 --> 06:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
asked a moment ago
 
06:44:53.040 --> 06:44:53.690 align:start position:0%
asked a moment ago
um

06:44:53.690 --> 06:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:58.010 --> 06:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
if that first line of the new bill
 
06:45:00.410 --> 06:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
said no zoning ordinance local land use
 
06:45:02.030 --> 06:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
regulation shall prohibit regulate
 
06:45:02.040 --> 06:45:03.288 align:start position:0%
regulation shall prohibit regulate
restrict

06:45:03.288 --> 06:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
restrict
 
06:45:06.590 --> 06:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
use of Lander structures based primarily
 
06:45:09.110 --> 06:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
on the use on the religious nature of
 
06:45:12.530 --> 06:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
the use would that solve the problem
 
06:45:14.150 --> 06:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
because I I think what I'm struggling
 
06:45:16.970 --> 06:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
with here is that the new rule talks
 
06:45:19.128 --> 06:45:19.138 align:start position:0%
about the nature of the use being why
 
06:45:21.310 --> 06:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
the restrictions happening the other one
 
06:45:24.230 --> 06:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
talks about the fact that that's the
 
06:45:27.110 --> 06:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of the structure it says
 
06:45:28.910 --> 06:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of land or structures
 
06:45:30.948 --> 06:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
primarily used for religious purposes
 
06:45:33.288 --> 06:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
and so it seems like that opens a much
 
06:45:37.610 --> 06:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
broader door to anything happening at a
 
06:45:39.590 --> 06:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
land on land that's used primarily for
 
06:45:41.270 --> 06:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
religious purposes where the new
 
06:45:42.890 --> 06:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
language seems like it's
 
06:45:45.708 --> 06:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
more concretely focused on whether the
 
06:45:51.048 --> 06:45:51.058 align:start position:0%
Restriction is either primarily or or uh
 
06:45:54.410 --> 06:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm losing my language here
 
06:45:56.570 --> 06:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
um uh predominantly or whatever the word
 
06:45:58.490 --> 06:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
was so I'm wondering whether or not it's
 
06:46:00.948 --> 06:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
possible to if you think that that would
 
06:46:03.230 --> 06:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
be an acceptable change that would sort
 
06:46:06.350 --> 06:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
of keep the focus on that the
 
06:46:08.448 --> 06:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
Restriction is based either solely or
 
06:46:10.368 --> 06:46:10.378 align:start position:0%
primarily on the religious nature of the
 
06:46:14.208 --> 06:46:14.218 align:start position:0%
use so primarily would solve the problem
 
06:46:17.810 --> 06:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
my view in section Roman one yes but
 
06:46:20.030 --> 06:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
there would still be a problem in
 
06:46:25.010 --> 06:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
section Roman two okay that an arbitrary
 
06:46:28.190 --> 06:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
and discretionary ordinance could be
 
06:46:31.010 --> 06:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
applied okay and it would be incumbent
 
06:46:32.750 --> 06:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
to show that that arbitrary
 
06:46:35.150 --> 06:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
discretionary ordinance results in a
 
06:46:38.270 --> 06:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
substantial burden okay the existing
 
06:46:41.570 --> 06:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
language okay says that you can't apply
 
06:46:41.580 --> 06:46:43.070 align:start position:0%
language okay says that you can't apply
arbitrary

06:46:43.070 --> 06:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
arbitrary
 
06:46:44.810 --> 06:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
um discretionary language such as fits
 
06:46:46.190 --> 06:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
within the character of the neighborhood
 
06:46:50.270 --> 06:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
because showing whether a requirement of
 
06:46:51.530 --> 06:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
fits within the character of the
 
06:46:53.150 --> 06:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
neighborhood results in a substantial
 
06:46:56.390 --> 06:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
burden becomes such a difficulty of
 
06:46:58.010 --> 06:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
proof that we're talking about years of
 
06:47:01.030 --> 06:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
litigation and and personal opinions
 
06:47:04.490 --> 06:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
instead of objective facts if you have
 
06:47:07.850 --> 06:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
however an ordinance that says that you
 
06:47:10.788 --> 06:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
have a height limitation of 35 feet okay
 
06:47:13.510 --> 06:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
you have a height limitation of 35 feet
 
06:47:16.310 --> 06:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's 35 feet whether you're a house a
 
06:47:19.070 --> 06:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
church a movie theater what have you
 
06:47:21.890 --> 06:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
so so start final follow-up if I might
 
06:47:21.900 --> 06:47:22.850 align:start position:0%
so so start final follow-up if I might
yep

06:47:22.850 --> 06:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
yep
 
06:47:24.468 --> 06:47:24.478 align:start position:0%
would it be would it create an
 
06:47:27.708 --> 06:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
inconsistency to have section one
 
06:47:29.570 --> 06:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
reference primarily and keep the
 
06:47:34.128 --> 06:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
language the way it's in in uh hb63 and
 
06:47:35.750 --> 06:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then switch over to the language
 
06:47:38.208 --> 06:47:38.218 align:start position:0%
that the existing law has for the rest
 
06:47:40.368 --> 06:47:40.378 align:start position:0%
of it
 
06:47:41.990 --> 06:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
sorry if that's a lot to just sort of
 
06:47:43.430 --> 06:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
throw out there so I think what you're
 
06:47:47.330 --> 06:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
saying is could one add the section
 
06:47:50.270 --> 06:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
Roman one with the word primarily two
 
06:47:52.250 --> 06:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
06:47:55.010 --> 06:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
um or to the or to the to the proposed
 
06:47:58.128 --> 06:47:58.138 align:start position:0%
in an amended version I guess
 
06:48:00.410 --> 06:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't see a particular problem
 
06:48:04.150 --> 06:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
with that as long as the prohibition on
 
06:48:07.490 --> 06:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
any regulations that are not listed in
 
06:48:10.910 --> 06:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:12.890 --> 06:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
06:48:15.110 --> 06:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you
 
06:48:22.910 --> 06:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:24.890 --> 06:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
06:48:26.330 --> 06:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Dan
 
06:48:28.250 --> 06:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
McGuire and I represent the town of
 
06:48:32.330 --> 06:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
Epsom I apologize for not being better
 
06:48:34.610 --> 06:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak to you on this issue
 
06:48:37.250 --> 06:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
but I I was unaware of this bill until I
 
06:48:38.690 --> 06:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
walked in the door a couple of minutes
 
06:48:41.750 --> 06:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
ago to talk on a subsequent hearing and
 
06:48:44.270 --> 06:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
but I am a member of the Epsom planning
 
06:48:48.410 --> 06:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
board and so I'm very familiar with uh
 
06:48:50.590 --> 06:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
whatever it is RSA
 
06:48:54.170 --> 06:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
674 colon 76 which is the topic of this
 
06:48:56.570 --> 06:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
bill and so
 
06:48:59.570 --> 06:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
um our our planning board is planning to
 
06:49:01.310 --> 06:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
and maybe what I'm about to say you've
 
06:49:02.930 --> 06:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
heard from others but my our planning
 
06:49:07.070 --> 06:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
board is planning to uh ask our town to
 
06:49:10.128 --> 06:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
change our zoning regulations in direct
 
06:49:15.590 --> 06:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
consequence of that new RSA to to uh
 
06:49:15.600 --> 06:49:17.150 align:start position:0%
consequence of that new RSA to to uh
remove

06:49:17.150 --> 06:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
remove
 
06:49:20.810 --> 06:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
um location stuff related to churches
 
06:49:22.490 --> 06:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
right to change our zoning so it
 
06:49:25.330 --> 06:49:25.340 align:start position:0%
complies with this with this particular
 
06:49:30.048 --> 06:49:30.058 align:start position:0%
section and but but we do think on our
 
06:49:32.930 --> 06:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
planning board that this section needs
 
06:49:35.810 --> 06:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
to be fixed a bit because mainly because
 
06:49:39.530 --> 06:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
it includes this list of things that we
 
06:49:42.530 --> 06:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
can regulate and that list is is
 
06:49:45.770 --> 06:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
inadequate right it's a list it says so
 
06:49:48.170 --> 06:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
such Heights such setbacks such yard
 
06:49:50.708 --> 06:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
size and so on but it doesn't include
 
06:49:54.288 --> 06:49:54.298 align:start position:0%
drainage it doesn't include signage it
 
06:49:55.910 --> 06:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't include parking it doesn't
 
06:49:58.010 --> 06:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
include driveways you know all the
 
06:49:59.708 --> 06:49:59.718 align:start position:0%
things that we would normally
 
06:50:02.448 --> 06:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
regulate so we don't care the fact that
 
06:50:05.448 --> 06:50:05.458 align:start position:0%
it you know it's fine uh that churches
 
06:50:07.190 --> 06:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
can be anywhere I think that's the main
 
06:50:10.430 --> 06:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
point of this but I we just don't think
 
06:50:14.150 --> 06:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
you really want a list of of this is
 
06:50:16.190 --> 06:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
what you can regulate I mean that should
 
06:50:18.288 --> 06:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
be somewhere else dealing with planning
 
06:50:20.448 --> 06:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
boards can regulate these things kind of
 
06:50:24.048 --> 06:50:24.058 align:start position:0%
thing and and in here it should be just
 
06:50:26.690 --> 06:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
don't just don't give special treatment
 
06:50:29.868 --> 06:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
to churches because they're churches and
 
06:50:32.690 --> 06:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
and uh different than you would do other
 
06:50:35.390 --> 06:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
things either in that area or in town or
 
06:50:37.490 --> 06:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
however you want to ride it but but the
 
06:50:39.708 --> 06:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
fact that you put a list of of things
 
06:50:42.468 --> 06:50:42.478 align:start position:0%
that planning boards can regulate in
 
06:50:45.230 --> 06:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
this particular little section seems to
 
06:50:47.570 --> 06:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
be wrong to us but you know we'll deal
 
06:50:49.670 --> 06:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
with it whatever you do but it's just
 
06:50:52.430 --> 06:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
the list itself seems kind of weird
 
06:50:54.430 --> 06:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
because there's plenty of stuff about
 
06:50:56.868 --> 06:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
land and building and so on that we
 
06:50:56.878 --> 06:50:58.250 align:start position:0%
land and building and so on that we
regulate

06:50:58.250 --> 06:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
06:51:00.250 --> 06:51:00.260 align:start position:0%
that's not here
 
06:51:03.350 --> 06:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair questions for
 
06:51:06.170 --> 06:51:06.180 align:start position:0%

06:51:25.250 --> 06:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
that's my bill yes
 
06:51:27.530 --> 06:51:27.540 align:start position:0%

okay

um I'm the senior pastor of Crossing
 
06:52:27.170 --> 06:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
Light Church in Windham and I rise today
 
06:52:30.410 --> 06:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
to oppose hb63 the current law was just
 
06:52:31.968 --> 06:52:31.978 align:start position:0%
passed this year it's clear
 
06:52:34.250 --> 06:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
understandable protects churches in New
 
06:52:36.410 --> 06:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from undue hardship and
 
06:52:39.288 --> 06:52:39.298 align:start position:0%
sometimes discrimination we've
 
06:52:41.330 --> 06:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
personally experienced this kind of
 
06:52:44.270 --> 06:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
history for the past decade in Windham
 
06:52:47.208 --> 06:52:47.218 align:start position:0%
in 2003 we were denied property tax
 
06:52:48.948 --> 06:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
exemption and had to spend tens of
 
06:52:50.448 --> 06:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and at that point
 
06:52:52.850 --> 06:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
we're a very small Church
 
06:52:54.468 --> 06:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
um to sue the town and receive the
 
06:52:56.990 --> 06:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
exemption that we deserved these types
 
06:52:59.448 --> 06:52:59.458 align:start position:0%
of situations have continued until more
 
06:53:01.968 --> 06:53:01.978 align:start position:0%
recently the church had to spend tens of
 
06:53:04.128 --> 06:53:04.138 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to gain permission
 
06:53:06.830 --> 06:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
to erect a tent for our work weekly
 
06:53:10.128 --> 06:53:10.138 align:start position:0%
services and programming we were charged
 
06:53:11.868 --> 06:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
fees and asked to go through processes
 
06:53:14.150 --> 06:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
that no other business or organization
 
06:53:15.830 --> 06:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
had to do
 
06:53:17.810 --> 06:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
we had to submit administrative appeal
 
06:53:19.788 --> 06:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
to the zoning board against those
 
06:53:21.350 --> 06:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
officials who are supposed to be there
 
06:53:22.788 --> 06:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
to help and guide us
 
06:53:24.948 --> 06:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
the assault was so incredulous that
 
06:53:27.890 --> 06:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
residents outside of our church as well
 
06:53:30.468 --> 06:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
as a building official from Manchester
 
06:53:33.770 --> 06:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
came alongside to advocate for us
 
06:53:35.330 --> 06:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
Crossing Life Church of the church that
 
06:53:37.430 --> 06:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
spends a lot of effort to support and
 
06:53:39.230 --> 06:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
strengthen our community and the
 
06:53:41.150 --> 06:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities with its
 
06:53:43.968 --> 06:53:43.978 align:start position:0%
programs and resources we offer weekly
 
06:53:46.128 --> 06:53:46.138 align:start position:0%
events for children youth elderly
 
06:53:47.868 --> 06:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they attend our
 
06:53:49.910 --> 06:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
church or not we allow other community
 
06:53:52.368 --> 06:53:52.378 align:start position:0%
groups to use our property like the Boys
 
06:53:55.430 --> 06:53:55.440 align:start position:0%

06:53:57.468 --> 06:53:57.478 align:start position:0%

06:54:06.350 --> 06:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
mentoring program for Children and Youth
 
06:54:08.150 --> 06:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
in a community garden in partnership
 
06:54:11.390 --> 06:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
with the town free of charge we want to
 
06:54:13.610 --> 06:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
spend our time and energy serving as a
 
06:54:16.010 --> 06:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
resource in Windham and the surrounding
 
06:54:17.628 --> 06:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
communities and not fighting against
 
06:54:21.530 --> 06:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
undue hardships and clear discrimination
 
06:54:24.048 --> 06:54:24.058 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate your time today and
 
06:54:27.410 --> 06:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
I ask that you oppose hb63 and allow the
 
06:54:29.750 --> 06:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
current law that protects us to remain
 
06:54:31.690 --> 06:54:31.700 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
06:54:34.250 --> 06:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
06:54:34.260 --> 06:54:37.128 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
representative

06:54:37.128 --> 06:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:39.830 --> 06:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming here today pastor a
 
06:54:42.350 --> 06:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
question for you are you in opposition
 
06:54:45.468 --> 06:54:45.478 align:start position:0%
to the proposed amendment which uh
 
06:54:48.590 --> 06:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney had just recently
 
06:54:50.690 --> 06:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
presented I'm not sure if you've gotten
 
06:54:52.910 --> 06:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
to see a copy of that yet or not I did
 
06:54:56.570 --> 06:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I I am I am opposing it because of
 
06:55:00.548 --> 06:55:00.558 align:start position:0%
introducing more ability to the towns to
 
06:55:03.830 --> 06:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
regulate your activity outside of the
 
06:55:07.190 --> 06:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
regulation of State Des building
 
06:55:08.690 --> 06:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
setbacks Heights building codes
 
06:55:11.150 --> 06:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
Electrical Plumbing code
 
06:55:13.968 --> 06:55:13.978 align:start position:0%
because it allows uh
 
06:55:16.548 --> 06:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
like a discretionary determination
 
06:55:16.558 --> 06:55:17.750 align:start position:0%
like a discretionary determination
that's

06:55:17.750 --> 06:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:55:20.090 --> 06:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
they can just request things because
 
06:55:21.830 --> 06:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
they want to request it
 
06:55:24.350 --> 06:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you even building design like we
 
06:55:26.390 --> 06:55:26.400 align:start position:0%

other questions for this Witness

um

06:55:40.368 --> 06:55:40.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:44.868 --> 06:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry Dan representative Hayes
 
06:55:48.288 --> 06:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
my Heinz I'm sorry that's Heinz uh thank
 
06:55:50.868 --> 06:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
you uh chair uh danheim's representing
 
06:55:50.878 --> 06:55:52.250 align:start position:0%
you uh chair uh danheim's representing
Bedford

06:55:52.250 --> 06:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
Bedford
 
06:55:54.890 --> 06:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
um I'll just uh say kind of appalled
 
06:55:56.448 --> 06:55:56.458 align:start position:0%
that this happened in Bedford where they
 
06:55:58.610 --> 06:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
treat religions differently I think
 
06:56:00.410 --> 06:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's entirely offensive to the
 
06:56:02.330 --> 06:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
Constitution I don't know how in any
 
06:56:04.730 --> 06:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
world that survives uh Viewpoint
 
06:56:06.708 --> 06:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
discrimination I think it's laughable
 
06:56:06.718 --> 06:56:07.910 align:start position:0%
discrimination I think it's laughable
but

06:56:07.910 --> 06:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:56:10.128 --> 06:56:10.138 align:start position:0%
um that's why we need laws like this um
 
06:56:12.110 --> 06:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
to clarify so um I should have led with
 
06:56:13.368 --> 06:56:13.378 align:start position:0%
that I do oppose the original language
 
06:56:15.830 --> 06:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill I think existing law is
 
06:56:18.650 --> 06:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
great actually protects towns and uh or
 
06:56:21.048 --> 06:56:21.058 align:start position:0%
protects some religious freedom and I
 
06:56:23.390 --> 06:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
think this bill I'm not sure the intent
 
06:56:24.650 --> 06:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
of it but I think it does the complete
 
06:56:26.390 --> 06:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
opposite I think if this bill we're
 
06:56:28.850 --> 06:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
enacted it just doesn't do anything I
 
06:56:30.708 --> 06:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
think it just sort of recites or makes
 
06:56:33.048 --> 06:56:33.058 align:start position:0%
worse existing law
 
06:56:35.448 --> 06:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
um as a attorney Tierney pointed out I
 
06:56:37.610 --> 06:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
think the my main problem is based
 
06:56:39.708 --> 06:56:39.718 align:start position:0%
solely on the religious nature I don't
 
06:56:43.010 --> 06:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
think towns are usually blatant enough
 
06:56:44.510 --> 06:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
to say we're not gonna let you do this
 
06:56:45.830 --> 06:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
because you're a church but sometimes
 
06:56:48.048 --> 06:56:48.058 align:start position:0%
they do so I just expect it would be
 
06:56:49.548 --> 06:56:49.558 align:start position:0%
smarter about going about the
 
06:56:52.128 --> 06:56:52.138 align:start position:0%
regulations to limit churches in regards
 
06:56:54.288 --> 06:56:54.298 align:start position:0%
to paragraph two one of my concerns is
 
06:56:56.390 --> 06:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
it seems like the legislature is trying
 
06:56:59.628 --> 06:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
to define a type of standard and in
 
06:57:01.548 --> 06:57:01.558 align:start position:0%
looking at it I think they somehow went
 
06:57:03.530 --> 06:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
between height and scrutiny or
 
06:57:05.270 --> 06:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
intermediate scrutiny and strict
 
06:57:07.670 --> 06:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
scrutiny so the difference obviously
 
06:57:09.468 --> 06:57:09.478 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny from my point would be
 
06:57:12.110 --> 06:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
the best because generally statutes a
 
06:57:14.270 --> 06:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
lot less likely to be upheld but thing
 
06:57:15.948 --> 06:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
missing from strict scrutiny is narrowly
 
06:57:17.628 --> 06:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
tailored so it's not actually super
 
06:57:21.350 --> 06:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
experience so I just suggest that if you
 
06:57:23.390 --> 06:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
want to keep protecting religious
 
06:57:25.490 --> 06:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
freedom that existing law is good and
 
06:57:28.250 --> 06:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
this does the opposite in regards to
 
06:57:29.868 --> 06:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney's amendment I
 
06:57:31.128 --> 06:57:31.138 align:start position:0%
didn't hear anything particularly bad
 
06:57:33.230 --> 06:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
about that I certainly support that much
 
06:57:35.330 --> 06:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
more than this existing
 
06:57:38.510 --> 06:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
um bill I don't think I have anything
 
06:57:38.520 --> 06:57:39.468 align:start position:0%
um bill I don't think I have anything
further

06:57:39.468 --> 06:57:39.478 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:57:41.990 --> 06:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
06:57:45.468 --> 06:57:45.478 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir actually none
 
06:57:45.478 --> 06:57:47.170 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir actually none
and

06:57:47.170 --> 06:57:47.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:57:51.430 --> 06:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:54.170 --> 06:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
naturally sorry about that thank you Mr
 
06:57:56.030 --> 06:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
chair Nate Graves for the municipal
 
06:57:58.968 --> 06:57:58.978 align:start position:0%
Association glad to be back here
 
06:58:02.030 --> 06:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
um so I had a couple handouts for you I
 
06:58:04.850 --> 06:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
had some written testimony that
 
06:58:07.128 --> 06:58:07.138 align:start position:0%
um explained kind of the origins of this
 
06:58:10.190 --> 06:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
bill as well as a second document with a
 
06:58:13.368 --> 06:58:13.378 align:start position:0%
purple tab on it to direct you to the
 
06:58:17.090 --> 06:58:17.100 align:start position:0%
correct page so over the summer nhma
 
06:58:19.070 --> 06:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
spent time with the Bureau of economic
 
06:58:20.330 --> 06:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
Affairs office of Planning and
 
06:58:22.730 --> 06:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
Development they're the state agency
 
06:58:24.110 --> 06:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
that provides
 
06:58:27.230 --> 06:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh guidance to local planning zoning
 
06:58:29.208 --> 06:58:29.218 align:start position:0%
boards they're formerly known as OSI or
 
06:58:32.090 --> 06:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
the office strategic initiatives and
 
06:58:33.948 --> 06:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
they publish some important documents
 
06:58:36.530 --> 06:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
like planning planning hand planning
 
06:58:38.990 --> 06:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
handbook and the zoning handbook which
 
06:58:40.490 --> 06:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
are used by planning boards and zoning
 
06:58:42.410 --> 06:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
boards throughout the state
 
06:58:45.110 --> 06:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and we spent time with them to
 
06:58:46.730 --> 06:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
try to figure out how to implement the
 
06:58:48.590 --> 06:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
new law how what what advice do we give
 
06:58:50.810 --> 06:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
cities and towns about how this
 
06:58:52.670 --> 06:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
functions and how to implement it at the
 
06:58:54.010 --> 06:58:54.020 align:start position:0%
local level
 
06:58:57.288 --> 06:58:57.298 align:start position:0%
and it was problematic and so that's
 
06:58:58.670 --> 06:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
Illustrated in the guidance document
 
06:59:00.490 --> 06:59:00.500 align:start position:0%
with the purple tab
 
06:59:04.010 --> 06:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
so looking at
 
06:59:04.020 --> 06:59:05.510 align:start position:0%
so looking at
um

06:59:05.510 --> 06:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:09.770 --> 06:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
existing law that applied to local land
 
06:59:12.410 --> 06:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
use boards and local land use
 
06:59:15.410 --> 06:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
regulations prior to the enactment of
 
06:59:17.810 --> 06:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
the law last year there are a couple of
 
06:59:17.820 --> 06:59:19.368 align:start position:0%
the law last year there are a couple of
relevant

06:59:19.368 --> 06:59:19.378 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
06:59:19.378 --> 06:59:21.530 align:start position:0%
relevant
um

06:59:21.530 --> 06:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:25.128 --> 06:59:25.138 align:start position:0%
pieces of well law that that we thought
 
06:59:27.170 --> 06:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
made sense to put into statute because
 
06:59:29.810 --> 06:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
they weren't currently in statute and
 
06:59:31.490 --> 06:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
that was as previously mentioned that
 
06:59:35.208 --> 06:59:35.218 align:start position:0%
the Church of lucamai Babylon High
 
06:59:38.690 --> 06:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
versus halaya from 1993 and I apologize
 
06:59:40.730 --> 06:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
for butchering that name that's that's
 
06:59:43.548 --> 06:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court precedent
 
06:59:46.368 --> 06:59:46.378 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's hopefully captured
 
06:59:48.410 --> 06:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
in Roman one here in the original
 
06:59:51.830 --> 06:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and it simply says that you
 
06:59:53.750 --> 06:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
can't have a land use regulation that or
 
06:59:55.548 --> 06:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance essentially says you
 
06:59:57.110 --> 06:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
can't build churches
 
06:59:59.030 --> 06:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
um you just can't do that that is
 
06:59:59.040 --> 07:00:01.128 align:start position:0%
um you just can't do that that is
unconstitutional

07:00:01.128 --> 07:00:01.138 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
07:00:03.288 --> 07:00:03.298 align:start position:0%
um and then section two was supposed to
 
07:00:03.298 --> 07:00:04.548 align:start position:0%
um and then section two was supposed to
capture

07:00:04.548 --> 07:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
capture
 
07:00:06.468 --> 07:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
um the application of relupa the
 
07:00:08.030 --> 07:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
religious land use and institutional
 
07:00:11.810 --> 07:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
persons Act of 2000 and clarify that
 
07:00:14.690 --> 07:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
that does apply in New Hampshire so that
 
07:00:17.150 --> 07:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
was the
 
07:00:20.150 --> 07:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
um that were the main points of the bill
 
07:00:21.890 --> 07:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
that the original bill that you see in
 
07:00:23.570 --> 07:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
07:00:25.548 --> 07:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
um and to that extent
 
07:00:26.810 --> 07:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
um I would not be in favor
 
07:00:29.150 --> 07:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney's um Amendment
 
07:00:31.310 --> 07:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
simply because it preserves the original
 
07:00:33.170 --> 07:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
language of the bill
 
07:00:35.930 --> 07:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
um as as my handout illustrates we
 
07:00:39.410 --> 07:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
identified some concerns with that
 
07:00:39.420 --> 07:00:40.310 align:start position:0%
identified some concerns with that
um

07:00:40.310 --> 07:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:44.208 --> 07:00:44.218 align:start position:0%
and it's a bit confusing how that is is
 
07:00:47.510 --> 07:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be implemented because even
 
07:00:50.750 --> 07:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
though there's only a short list of
 
07:00:53.150 --> 07:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
things that towns can look at
 
07:00:55.070 --> 07:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
there are other things not captured
 
07:00:56.810 --> 07:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
within the typical
 
07:00:59.208 --> 07:00:59.218 align:start position:0%
um zoning areas that they may also look
 
07:01:01.070 --> 07:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
at when
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
some sort of structure or application
 
07:01:06.170 --> 07:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
for a structure comes forward for
 
07:01:08.150 --> 07:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
religious use
 
07:01:09.948 --> 07:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
um so while it's pretty clear from the
 
07:01:11.448 --> 07:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
existing law they can't look at things
 
07:01:14.170 --> 07:01:14.180 align:start position:0%
like lighting signs noise Etc
 
07:01:17.570 --> 07:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
they can look at things like building
 
07:01:21.110 --> 07:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
fire codes driveway regulations other
 
07:01:23.810 --> 07:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
areas that aren't necessarily falling
 
07:01:27.468 --> 07:01:27.478 align:start position:0%
under existing zoning ordinances but
 
07:01:30.110 --> 07:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
they are still land use statutes
 
07:01:32.570 --> 07:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh and we we were concerned that this
 
07:01:34.670 --> 07:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
would trip up municipalities that they
 
07:01:37.490 --> 07:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
would get in trouble because the uh
 
07:01:39.170 --> 07:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
because they were unclear of how to
 
07:01:41.690 --> 07:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
apply the law and so basically the
 
07:01:43.548 --> 07:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
advice that we created in conjunction
 
07:01:45.890 --> 07:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
with Bea this summer was call your call
 
07:01:48.830 --> 07:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
your lawyer and have them help you
 
07:01:50.930 --> 07:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
um and
 
07:01:52.850 --> 07:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
really that's because it wasn't quite
 
07:01:54.590 --> 07:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
clear how to apply something like a
 
07:01:57.230 --> 07:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
primarily religious use test
 
07:01:59.990 --> 07:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
um it's possible There's A time test so
 
07:02:02.030 --> 07:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
how long is a space used for religious
 
07:02:04.010 --> 07:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
function versus non-religious functions
 
07:02:05.930 --> 07:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
so I know one of the previous speakers
 
07:02:08.750 --> 07:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
talked about using the space for the Boy
 
07:02:11.030 --> 07:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
Scouts the Girl Scouts Etc
 
07:02:14.208 --> 07:02:14.218 align:start position:0%
those aren't typically religious groups
 
07:02:16.310 --> 07:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
I mean they're non-profit groups that
 
07:02:17.930 --> 07:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
exist and they do things throughout the
 
07:02:20.270 --> 07:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
communities and those typically aren't
 
07:02:22.548 --> 07:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
considered religious and we didn't want
 
07:02:24.410 --> 07:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have to look at well
 
07:02:25.910 --> 07:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
how much time are the Boy Scouts there
 
07:02:27.650 --> 07:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
versus how much time is you know the
 
07:02:29.150 --> 07:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
pastor they're giving service that
 
07:02:32.150 --> 07:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like a good solution we
 
07:02:34.190 --> 07:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
also didn't want to have them have to
 
07:02:37.670 --> 07:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
use a space test because that that would
 
07:02:40.330 --> 07:02:40.340 align:start position:0%
be a problem as well because you have
 
07:02:44.030 --> 07:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
some religious structures that then have
 
07:02:45.770 --> 07:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
a large parking lot surrounding them in
 
07:02:48.590 --> 07:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
fact most of the land or the lot might
 
07:02:50.690 --> 07:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
actually be the parking lot it might be
 
07:02:52.610 --> 07:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
Woods it might be stuff that isn't used
 
07:02:52.620 --> 07:02:53.810 align:start position:0%
Woods it might be stuff that isn't used
for

07:02:53.810 --> 07:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:02:57.410 --> 07:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
some sort of religious purpose so again
 
07:03:00.350 --> 07:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
you're not accomplishing the goal of the
 
07:03:01.850 --> 07:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
legislation which is to protect
 
07:03:01.860 --> 07:03:03.770 align:start position:0%
legislation which is to protect
religious

07:03:03.770 --> 07:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
religious
 
07:03:07.788 --> 07:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
um activities on specific Parcels so
 
07:03:10.368 --> 07:03:10.378 align:start position:0%
that's really the basis of
 
07:03:13.128 --> 07:03:13.138 align:start position:0%
of my uh testimony and I see some
 
07:03:15.590 --> 07:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
confused looks out there I'm happy to
 
07:03:17.030 --> 07:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions that anyone has
 
07:03:21.350 --> 07:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:22.910 --> 07:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you for
 
07:03:24.288 --> 07:03:24.298 align:start position:0%
your time
 
07:03:26.930 --> 07:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
07:03:30.708 --> 07:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
testify on hb63
 
07:03:32.930 --> 07:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll close the hearing on
 
07:03:36.708 --> 07:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
that and we will turn to our last bill
 
07:03:40.430 --> 07:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
of the day that uh I have to say both
 
07:03:42.288 --> 07:03:42.298 align:start position:0%
the ranking member and myself forgot
 
07:03:47.448 --> 07:03:47.458 align:start position:0%
forgot was here it's uh HB 256.
 
07:03:47.458 --> 07:03:50.868 align:start position:0%
forgot was here it's uh HB 256.
um

07:03:50.868 --> 07:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:55.930 --> 07:03:55.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:01.730 --> 07:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:04.730 --> 07:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:07.850 --> 07:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
all right um so I'm I'm gonna represent
 
07:04:10.070 --> 07:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to uh recognize representative
 
07:04:12.890 --> 07:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
McGuire uh to testify as the sponsor of
 
07:04:14.868 --> 07:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you Mr chairman members
 
07:04:16.070 --> 07:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee once again I'm Dan
 
07:04:20.750 --> 07:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
McGuire uh representing Epsom so uh this
 
07:04:22.310 --> 07:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
bill is based on an incident that
 
07:04:23.628 --> 07:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
happened to me so I'm gonna have to tell
 
07:04:25.310 --> 07:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
you an anecdote of what happened to me
 
07:04:26.628 --> 07:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
and then I'm going to have to convince
 
07:04:29.208 --> 07:04:29.218 align:start position:0%
you that uh maybe it can happen to other
 
07:04:31.190 --> 07:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
people and and therefore we should pass
 
07:04:32.330 --> 07:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:04:36.288 --> 07:04:36.298 align:start position:0%
so I'm the chair of our local Republican
 
07:04:39.110 --> 07:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
Town committee and
 
07:04:41.770 --> 07:04:41.780 align:start position:0%
um prior to the primary so last August
 
07:04:45.948 --> 07:04:45.958 align:start position:0%
we wanted to have an event where we uh
 
07:04:49.128 --> 07:04:49.138 align:start position:0%
have primary voters and primary
 
07:04:51.770 --> 07:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
candidates get together and meet
 
07:04:55.010 --> 07:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
and my town has a park and in the park
 
07:04:58.250 --> 07:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
is a large Pavilion with a roof and
 
07:05:00.650 --> 07:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
about two dozen picnic tables underneath
 
07:05:05.628 --> 07:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
and a small restroom nearby and we you
 
07:05:08.868 --> 07:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
can go to the town office and rent this
 
07:05:11.030 --> 07:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
Pavilion or you can rent the whole park
 
07:05:13.190 --> 07:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to but I we only wanted
 
07:05:16.610 --> 07:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
the Pavilion and there's a certain fee
 
07:05:18.770 --> 07:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
for doing that you have to have one
 
07:05:20.570 --> 07:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
day's worth of insurance and so on
 
07:05:22.610 --> 07:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
there's certain restrictions but you
 
07:05:24.410 --> 07:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
also have to tell them what are you
 
07:05:27.410 --> 07:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
using it for okay so I wrote down
 
07:05:31.010 --> 07:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
meeting of Republicans right and
 
07:05:34.128 --> 07:05:34.138 align:start position:0%
um so it was denied
 
07:05:37.010 --> 07:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that we don't allow
 
07:05:40.330 --> 07:05:40.340 align:start position:0%
political activities in this location
 
07:05:44.930 --> 07:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay which to me is crazy because you
 
07:05:46.670 --> 07:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
know that's like anti-free speech and
 
07:05:48.890 --> 07:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff and
 
07:05:51.048 --> 07:05:51.058 align:start position:0%
um and it's also sort of silly because
 
07:05:53.510 --> 07:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
in this particular Park is where we hold
 
07:05:56.930 --> 07:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
our old home Day activities and both the
 
07:05:58.968 --> 07:05:58.978 align:start position:0%
Republicans and the Democrats have had
 
07:06:02.750 --> 07:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
booths every year for who knows how long
 
07:06:04.910 --> 07:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
so there are political activities going
 
07:06:06.830 --> 07:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
on in this location right in this park
 
07:06:09.590 --> 07:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
just not on that Pavilion on that
 
07:06:12.830 --> 07:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
particular day Etc and also our town is
 
07:06:14.990 --> 07:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat inconsistent because we also
 
07:06:16.910 --> 07:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
have a library and the library has a
 
07:06:20.390 --> 07:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
community room and that room
 
07:06:23.628 --> 07:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
um is used regularly by democrats for
 
07:06:25.490 --> 07:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
their you know monthly meetings or
 
07:06:28.190 --> 07:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
whatever no charge no insurance no
 
07:06:30.948 --> 07:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
nothing and I and I could use that room
 
07:06:33.288 --> 07:06:33.298 align:start position:0%
too if I wanted to I just preferred in
 
07:06:35.270 --> 07:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
this particular case to want to use the
 
07:06:37.850 --> 07:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
Pavilion so
 
07:06:41.150 --> 07:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
um so it seems to me I could probably
 
07:06:43.610 --> 07:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
get an attorney and and write a letter
 
07:06:46.670 --> 07:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
or Sue or something but since I'm a
 
07:06:46.680 --> 07:06:48.890 align:start position:0%
or Sue or something but since I'm a
legislator

07:06:48.890 --> 07:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
07:06:50.390 --> 07:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
um you know it's like you have a hammer
 
07:06:53.330 --> 07:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
and you every problem looks like a nail
 
07:06:56.868 --> 07:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
um I write legislation right to try to
 
07:06:58.250 --> 07:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
solve this problem and I think what
 
07:07:00.048 --> 07:07:00.058 align:start position:0%
would happen if you if we were able to
 
07:07:02.448 --> 07:07:02.458 align:start position:0%
pass this is I could go to the committee
 
07:07:04.190 --> 07:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
that deals with the park and say look
 
07:07:08.868 --> 07:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
RSA 155 39e says you can't discriminate
 
07:07:11.930 --> 07:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
based on political activity and
 
07:07:13.850 --> 07:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
um therefore they would in the future if
 
07:07:15.410 --> 07:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
I wanted to do the same thing they would
 
07:07:17.990 --> 07:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
let me use let me rent it
 
07:07:22.910 --> 07:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
um so I my guess is it's because why I
 
07:07:25.670 --> 07:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
had the problem is because the park is
 
07:07:28.690 --> 07:07:28.700 align:start position:0%
kind of under control of a particular
 
07:07:32.150 --> 07:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee and and that committee doesn't
 
07:07:34.670 --> 07:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
know any better right and and
 
07:07:37.910 --> 07:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
um it'd be a lot easier rather than go
 
07:07:39.650 --> 07:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
to them with some sort of argument well
 
07:07:42.110 --> 07:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
you know this is a First Amendment case
 
07:07:44.468 --> 07:07:44.478 align:start position:0%
and you can't you can't discriminate Etc
 
07:07:47.448 --> 07:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
it'd be easier if I had a specific a
 
07:07:50.810 --> 07:07:50.820 align:start position:0%
very specific thing okay in Parks you
 
07:07:53.930 --> 07:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
can't discriminate and and
 
07:07:56.390 --> 07:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
um that would solve this problem and I
 
07:07:59.868 --> 07:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
think it's it's unlikely with 200 and
 
07:08:03.110 --> 07:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
however many towns that I'm the only one
 
07:08:06.110 --> 07:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
and my town is the only one that might
 
07:08:07.850 --> 07:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
think to do this right or might have
 
07:08:10.730 --> 07:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
this kind of a problem so so
 
07:08:12.410 --> 07:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
um you know just because I don't know of
 
07:08:12.420 --> 07:08:13.788 align:start position:0%
um you know just because I don't know of
others

07:08:13.788 --> 07:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
others
 
07:08:16.128 --> 07:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to believe this kind of
 
07:08:18.110 --> 07:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
problem can't come up in the future it
 
07:08:19.788 --> 07:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
can't happen to anybody else and so on
 
07:08:21.110 --> 07:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
certainly it could happen to other
 
07:08:23.750 --> 07:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
people in my town but but
 
07:08:26.750 --> 07:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
um anyways so uh it's a very simple bill
 
07:08:30.288 --> 07:08:30.298 align:start position:0%
it to me it's like let's pass motherhood
 
07:08:32.270 --> 07:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
and apple pie
 
07:08:34.670 --> 07:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
um but it would help me out and and I
 
07:08:37.250 --> 07:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
think possibly others who run into the
 
07:08:38.990 --> 07:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
same sort of problem thank you Mr
 
07:08:41.330 --> 07:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
chairman sure uh questions for
 
07:08:44.628 --> 07:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
representative representative Perez
 
07:08:47.868 --> 07:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for this bill
 
07:08:51.230 --> 07:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
we have a very similar problem so you
 
07:08:52.690 --> 07:08:52.700 align:start position:0%
are not alone
 
07:08:55.670 --> 07:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
what happened to us is that they just
 
07:08:59.390 --> 07:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
decided to change the innate the use of
 
07:09:01.968 --> 07:09:01.978 align:start position:0%
the we have a community
 
07:09:05.150 --> 07:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
room called a community room
 
07:09:10.310 --> 07:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
we wanted to have our LSR meetings there
 
07:09:13.548 --> 07:09:13.558 align:start position:0%
um so they decided that well we're just
 
07:09:16.128 --> 07:09:16.138 align:start position:0%
not going to let anybody use it nicely
 
07:09:18.770 --> 07:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
so um there's a longer story to it but
 
07:09:20.030 --> 07:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
you don't need to know the whole thing
 
07:09:24.230 --> 07:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
so I it is happening in other places
 
07:09:27.350 --> 07:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
um we thank the Lord for churches
 
07:09:29.150 --> 07:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
because they have allowed us to use
 
07:09:31.850 --> 07:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
their facility but a
 
07:09:35.390 --> 07:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I feel that we are our taxes are
 
07:09:38.448 --> 07:09:38.458 align:start position:0%
paying for these rooms so um I support
 
07:09:41.930 --> 07:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
you 100 You are not alone thank you well
 
07:09:43.670 --> 07:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear a question but but you're
 
07:09:43.680 --> 07:09:44.590 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear a question but but you're
welcome

07:09:44.590 --> 07:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
07:09:48.288 --> 07:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
other question uh representative
 
07:09:51.288 --> 07:09:51.298 align:start position:0%
yeah just on the on the on the language
 
07:09:53.628 --> 07:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
in the bill about discrimination I think
 
07:09:55.368 --> 07:09:55.378 align:start position:0%
you had said there's another facility
 
07:09:58.670 --> 07:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
used by the other party in your town
 
07:10:01.070 --> 07:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
um that's not being charged but that you
 
07:10:03.110 --> 07:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
also wouldn't be charged if you use that
 
07:10:03.120 --> 07:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
also wouldn't be charged if you use that
facility

07:10:04.310 --> 07:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
facility
 
07:10:07.910 --> 07:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
would the same apply if that other group
 
07:10:11.750 --> 07:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
tried to use the facility that that you
 
07:10:14.810 --> 07:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
were hoping to use and in other words is
 
07:10:16.250 --> 07:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
there a discrimination right I
 
07:10:18.410 --> 07:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying so right
 
07:10:21.708 --> 07:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
the Discrimination is on the type of use
 
07:10:24.170 --> 07:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
right the fact that it's a political
 
07:10:26.810 --> 07:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
use right not the fact that it's
 
07:10:31.788 --> 07:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
Republicans Or democrats so so uh
 
07:10:35.090 --> 07:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
anyways yes I think if the Democrats
 
07:10:37.968 --> 07:10:37.978 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a picnic in this Pavilion
 
07:10:39.890 --> 07:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
they would not be allowed just like we
 
07:10:41.690 --> 07:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
were not allowed yes
 
07:10:44.448 --> 07:10:44.458 align:start position:0%
uh but but I think that that should be
 
07:10:47.150 --> 07:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
prohibited because because it's its use
 
07:10:49.788 --> 07:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
of public facilities and they're
 
07:10:52.190 --> 07:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
discriminating based on what we're going
 
07:10:55.010 --> 07:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
to talk about in that while while we're
 
07:10:56.750 --> 07:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
using those public facilities right
 
07:10:58.730 --> 07:10:58.740 align:start position:0%
isn't that discrimination against speech
 
07:11:00.708 --> 07:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
right that's just quick so so
 
07:11:02.750 --> 07:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
essentially it was because they made the
 
07:11:04.190 --> 07:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
statement it's not that they require
 
07:11:06.890 --> 07:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
insurance or a fee it was that they made
 
07:11:08.930 --> 07:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
the statement that they didn't want you
 
07:11:11.090 --> 07:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
so absolutely if you had made the
 
07:11:12.890 --> 07:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
payment and the and taken the insurance
 
07:11:15.288 --> 07:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
you would have been allowed to use that
 
07:11:19.490 --> 07:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
no no no okay yeah so I I mentioned that
 
07:11:20.990 --> 07:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
just because
 
07:11:23.690 --> 07:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
it seems weird to me anyways but you're
 
07:11:25.850 --> 07:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
right that part is irrelevant
 
07:11:28.730 --> 07:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
the the fee and the and the cost and all
 
07:11:30.350 --> 07:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
that you know what I mean I I don't
 
07:11:32.208 --> 07:11:32.218 align:start position:0%
really object I was willing to pay those
 
07:11:34.968 --> 07:11:34.978 align:start position:0%
things but but it's the it's the fact
 
07:11:39.830 --> 07:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
that certain speeches a certain talk is
 
07:11:42.110 --> 07:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
not allowed in this location right
 
07:11:44.570 --> 07:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
that's the key of this right
 
07:11:47.628 --> 07:11:47.638 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
07:11:50.390 --> 07:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair it's always a
 
07:11:52.850 --> 07:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
pleasure to see you
 
07:11:52.860 --> 07:11:53.810 align:start position:0%
pleasure to see you
um

07:11:53.810 --> 07:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:11:59.090 --> 07:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
this morning we heard House Bill 164
 
07:12:01.628 --> 07:12:01.638 align:start position:0%
relative to prohibiting towns from
 
07:12:04.490 --> 07:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
criminalizing the right to peacefully
 
07:12:09.350 --> 07:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:11.628 --> 07:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
this had to do with a little kerfuffle
 
07:12:14.150 --> 07:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
that happened in new fields
 
07:12:16.430 --> 07:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
Yule I'm sure enough to what I'm
 
07:12:19.070 --> 07:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
referring did it somehow involve the
 
07:12:23.930 --> 07:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
governor location yeah okay thank you
 
07:12:23.940 --> 07:12:25.910 align:start position:0%
governor location yeah okay thank you
foreign

07:12:25.910 --> 07:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:12:32.628 --> 07:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:38.030 --> 07:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
well maybe maybe slightly although
 
07:12:40.788 --> 07:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
here we're really talking about
 
07:12:44.650 --> 07:12:44.660 align:start position:0%
people reserving Town
 
07:12:48.070 --> 07:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
locations right I mean Parks
 
07:12:51.110 --> 07:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
Community buildings
 
07:12:54.770 --> 07:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
um things like that that are
 
07:12:57.288 --> 07:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
for a particular activity right I mean
 
07:12:59.868 --> 07:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
if I I suppose if somebody you know
 
07:13:02.090 --> 07:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to block off a street and have
 
07:13:03.708 --> 07:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
some kind of parade or something like
 
07:13:05.270 --> 07:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
that there might be a parade permit
 
07:13:09.110 --> 07:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
involved and and so that's kind of what
 
07:13:12.048 --> 07:13:12.058 align:start position:0%
I had in mind with this
 
07:13:15.530 --> 07:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
um yours sounds like the example you
 
07:13:17.030 --> 07:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
just talked about sounded like it was
 
07:13:19.010 --> 07:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
more about a spontaneous
 
07:13:21.468 --> 07:13:21.478 align:start position:0%
sort of a thing and and maybe it's a
 
07:13:24.890 --> 07:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:27.048 --> 07:13:27.058 align:start position:0%
there's a point yeah it wasn't
 
07:13:29.270 --> 07:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
spontaneous in that it was planned
 
07:13:32.090 --> 07:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
people knew it was going to happen
 
07:13:33.590 --> 07:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
um it was
 
07:13:35.990 --> 07:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
um on uh
 
07:13:38.948 --> 07:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
a street a public Street sidewalk
 
07:13:41.868 --> 07:13:41.878 align:start position:0%
walkway and
 
07:13:41.878 --> 07:13:43.368 align:start position:0%
walkway and
um

07:13:43.368 --> 07:13:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:45.530 --> 07:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
by the same token
 
07:13:50.330 --> 07:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
there are laws which prohibit people
 
07:13:50.340 --> 07:13:54.070 align:start position:0%
there are laws which prohibit people
from

07:13:54.070 --> 07:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:59.570 --> 07:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
Gathering near particular sites that may
 
07:14:02.570 --> 07:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
or may not be publicly owned but
 
07:14:05.090 --> 07:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
privately owed
 
07:14:07.070 --> 07:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
um where they're not permitted to to
 
07:14:07.080 --> 07:14:09.048 align:start position:0%
um where they're not permitted to to
congregate

07:14:09.048 --> 07:14:09.058 align:start position:0%
congregate
 
07:14:12.288 --> 07:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just a little nervous for
 
07:14:12.298 --> 07:14:14.810 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just a little nervous for
someone

07:14:14.810 --> 07:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:19.690 --> 07:14:19.700 align:start position:0%
like me who believes in Free Speech
 
07:14:22.310 --> 07:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
every place
 
07:14:25.368 --> 07:14:25.378 align:start position:0%
with rare exceptions
 
07:14:25.378 --> 07:14:27.708 align:start position:0%
with rare exceptions
um

07:14:27.708 --> 07:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:29.930 --> 07:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about a slippery slope
 
07:14:32.270 --> 07:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
here somehow
 
07:14:33.410 --> 07:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
07:14:35.530 --> 07:14:35.540 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not sure if you're
 
07:14:38.030 --> 07:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
asking me if the Two Bills should be
 
07:14:40.070 --> 07:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
combined or
 
07:14:41.868 --> 07:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
you know since I'm not that familiar
 
07:14:43.850 --> 07:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
with the other Bill maybe I can't really
 
07:14:43.860 --> 07:14:46.548 align:start position:0%
with the other Bill maybe I can't really
comment

07:14:46.548 --> 07:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:52.968 --> 07:14:52.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:56.628 --> 07:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
use our powers as legislators
 
07:14:56.638 --> 07:14:58.310 align:start position:0%
use our powers as legislators
to

07:14:58.310 --> 07:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:14:58.320 --> 07:14:59.048 align:start position:0%
to
um

07:14:59.048 --> 07:14:59.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:02.868 --> 07:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
solve a more common problem it's like
 
07:15:06.128 --> 07:15:06.138 align:start position:0%
you know the person without sight
 
07:15:08.690 --> 07:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
asked to describe an elephant and
 
07:15:10.910 --> 07:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
depending upon where the person is I'm
 
07:15:12.350 --> 07:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
sorry I shouldn't have said elephant
 
07:15:12.360 --> 07:15:14.288 align:start position:0%
sorry I shouldn't have said elephant
donkey

07:15:14.288 --> 07:15:14.298 align:start position:0%
donkey
 
07:15:16.810 --> 07:15:16.820 align:start position:0%
but depending upon where they are
 
07:15:18.830 --> 07:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's a donkey they're going to
 
07:15:22.010 --> 07:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
describe something very different and
 
07:15:24.948 --> 07:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
I just because we're a legislator
 
07:15:27.048 --> 07:15:27.058 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we should be passing bills
 
07:15:29.390 --> 07:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
all the time I guess is my concern okay
 
07:15:31.250 --> 07:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other question uh
 
07:15:35.810 --> 07:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:35.820 --> 07:15:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
ing

07:15:37.430 --> 07:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
ing
 
07:15:39.288 --> 07:15:39.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
07:15:41.990 --> 07:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
my question uh
 
07:15:44.510 --> 07:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
very interesting problem
 
07:15:46.610 --> 07:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh what I
 
07:15:49.850 --> 07:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
what I find extremely interesting is uh
 
07:15:52.990 --> 07:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you have a Town Fair
 
07:15:55.730 --> 07:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
occasionally old home day and you have
 
07:15:55.740 --> 07:15:57.548 align:start position:0%
occasionally old home day and you have
boosts

07:15:57.548 --> 07:15:57.558 align:start position:0%
boosts
 
07:16:00.110 --> 07:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
and uh you have
 
07:16:01.968 --> 07:16:01.978 align:start position:0%
Democratic booths and you have
 
07:16:03.770 --> 07:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
Republican votes
 
07:16:06.708 --> 07:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
and you're both on Town property
 
07:16:10.128 --> 07:16:10.138 align:start position:0%
and uh this shouldn't be permitted
 
07:16:14.690 --> 07:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
you know uh it it clearly sounds like
 
07:16:19.788 --> 07:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
you you ran into someone that isn't
 
07:16:19.798 --> 07:16:21.708 align:start position:0%
you you ran into someone that isn't
uh

07:16:21.708 --> 07:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:16:24.468 --> 07:16:24.478 align:start position:0%
isn't aware of past practices
 
07:16:28.250 --> 07:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
you know and and it
 
07:16:30.350 --> 07:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
because you probably use this this uh
 
07:16:31.850 --> 07:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
Pavilion before
 
07:16:35.030 --> 07:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
and uh something caught their eye and
 
07:16:37.610 --> 07:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
and they decided it wasn't permitted now
 
07:16:40.430 --> 07:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
07:16:42.110 --> 07:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
well all right thank you for the
 
07:16:44.628 --> 07:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
question representative but
 
07:16:48.590 --> 07:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
in fact I have many years ago used the
 
07:16:51.110 --> 07:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
Pavilion for a very similar purpose all
 
07:16:54.650 --> 07:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
right but I think what happened was a
 
07:16:54.660 --> 07:16:55.510 align:start position:0%
right but I think what happened was a
different

07:16:55.510 --> 07:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
07:17:00.468 --> 07:17:00.478 align:start position:0%
group of people became in charge of the
 
07:17:02.448 --> 07:17:02.458 align:start position:0%
use of the park not that they're
 
07:17:04.070 --> 07:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with old home day of course
 
07:17:05.930 --> 07:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
they are but
 
07:17:09.170 --> 07:17:09.180 align:start position:0%
um but they decided to make up a set of
 
07:17:11.990 --> 07:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
rules and they decided to you know write
 
07:17:13.968 --> 07:17:13.978 align:start position:0%
their rules however they wanted to you
 
07:17:15.590 --> 07:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
know they think well we're in charge of
 
07:17:17.270 --> 07:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
the park we can write the rules however
 
07:17:20.090 --> 07:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
we feel and so one of they decided to
 
07:17:20.100 --> 07:17:21.350 align:start position:0%
we feel and so one of they decided to
write

07:17:21.350 --> 07:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
write
 
07:17:24.650 --> 07:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
no political activities in the park you
 
07:17:26.390 --> 07:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
know because they thought it was a good
 
07:17:27.948 --> 07:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
idea kind of thing you know what I mean
 
07:17:31.430 --> 07:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's just what they decided to
 
07:17:34.010 --> 07:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
do is what happened and it was obviously
 
07:17:36.708 --> 07:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
different than the group that same group
 
07:17:41.330 --> 07:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
who existed in the past and so on so
 
07:17:44.270 --> 07:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up but that's that's
 
07:17:46.490 --> 07:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
you said that much better than I did
 
07:17:48.650 --> 07:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
okay because I was trying to say that
 
07:17:51.468 --> 07:17:51.478 align:start position:0%
you know and uh
 
07:17:54.590 --> 07:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
what it seems is that uh you have a
 
07:17:56.708 --> 07:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
local problem not a Statewide problem
 
07:18:02.150 --> 07:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
and I do agree that legislators tend to
 
07:18:05.208 --> 07:18:05.218 align:start position:0%
see changing laws is the solution to
 
07:18:08.090 --> 07:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
everything you know so that's uh
 
07:18:10.190 --> 07:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to say that you should
 
07:18:11.930 --> 07:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
probably talk to who's ever in charge of
 
07:18:16.430 --> 07:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
the park and not submit a bill
 
07:18:18.410 --> 07:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative Manos I think you had a
 
07:18:18.420 --> 07:18:19.610 align:start position:0%
representative Manos I think you had a
question

07:18:19.610 --> 07:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:18:21.770 --> 07:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
07:18:24.650 --> 07:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for for being here I
 
07:18:26.750 --> 07:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask about commercial speech
 
07:18:30.230 --> 07:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
and commercial use and your bill to me
 
07:18:33.110 --> 07:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
seems to be overly Broad in that it
 
07:18:35.208 --> 07:18:35.218 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear to me that it would give
 
07:18:38.468 --> 07:18:38.478 align:start position:0%
the town the ability to exclude
 
07:18:41.448 --> 07:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
commercial use
 
07:18:45.048 --> 07:18:45.058 align:start position:0%
um or commercial commercial use of the
 
07:18:49.788 --> 07:18:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:50.570 --> 07:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
07:18:50.580 --> 07:18:52.490 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
representative

07:18:52.490 --> 07:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:18:56.208 --> 07:18:56.218 align:start position:0%
um in my particular case
 
07:18:58.190 --> 07:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
on the same day we were going to have
 
07:19:01.010 --> 07:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
our event there was another event which
 
07:19:03.170 --> 07:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
was commercial going on in the different
 
07:19:05.690 --> 07:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
part of the park where they had rented
 
07:19:11.030 --> 07:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
it for selling crafts all right so so
 
07:19:14.390 --> 07:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:17.030 --> 07:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
um if if in general somebody wants to
 
07:19:20.270 --> 07:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
use it for some other purpose and that
 
07:19:22.128 --> 07:19:22.138 align:start position:0%
purpose is commercial
 
07:19:22.138 --> 07:19:23.390 align:start position:0%
purpose is commercial
um

07:19:23.390 --> 07:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:25.490 --> 07:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
I think they should be allowed you know
 
07:19:28.190 --> 07:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
what I mean so yeah other questions for
 
07:19:31.070 --> 07:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
this witness yes representative uh yeah
 
07:19:34.910 --> 07:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I building on what uh representative
 
07:19:36.830 --> 07:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
Smith was asking about about a previous
 
07:19:36.840 --> 07:19:38.390 align:start position:0%
Smith was asking about about a previous
case

07:19:38.390 --> 07:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
case
 
07:19:40.190 --> 07:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
um the one involving the governor's
 
07:19:40.200 --> 07:19:41.208 align:start position:0%
um the one involving the governor's
space

07:19:41.208 --> 07:19:41.218 align:start position:0%
space
 
07:19:42.530 --> 07:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that came up in
 
07:19:45.590 --> 07:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
that was essentially that it never the
 
07:19:47.570 --> 07:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
the there was a court case but it never
 
07:19:49.430 --> 07:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
really reached or or there was there was
 
07:19:51.230 --> 07:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh charges brought but it never really
 
07:19:52.910 --> 07:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
reached its conclusion because the
 
07:19:54.530 --> 07:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
charges were all dropped so it never
 
07:19:56.390 --> 07:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
made its way through the court system to
 
07:19:58.490 --> 07:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
figure out whether or not the the
 
07:20:00.468 --> 07:20:00.478 align:start position:0%
Constitutional guarantee would have
 
07:20:02.628 --> 07:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
prohibited that to begin with I'm
 
07:20:04.730 --> 07:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
wondering if this isn't maybe the same
 
07:20:07.910 --> 07:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
situation because essentially the right
 
07:20:10.368 --> 07:20:10.378 align:start position:0%
to assemble sort of does guarantee what
 
07:20:12.288 --> 07:20:12.298 align:start position:0%
you're asking I think
 
07:20:12.298 --> 07:20:12.948 align:start position:0%
you're asking I think
um

07:20:12.948 --> 07:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:15.948 --> 07:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
and so you said you would have had to go
 
07:20:17.868 --> 07:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
through the whole process of suing the
 
07:20:19.610 --> 07:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
town or something along those lines I'm
 
07:20:21.650 --> 07:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
wondering if this were to be in place
 
07:20:23.990 --> 07:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you theoretically still have to
 
07:20:26.030 --> 07:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
do that and does this actually add
 
07:20:28.430 --> 07:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
anything or or could if you had brought
 
07:20:31.610 --> 07:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
that to the town as either a lawsuit or
 
07:20:32.930 --> 07:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
something along those lines and it made
 
07:20:36.048 --> 07:20:36.058 align:start position:0%
its way up uh is it possible that the
 
07:20:38.150 --> 07:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
existing constitutional guarantee on
 
07:20:40.730 --> 07:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
assembly would have would have been
 
07:20:42.530 --> 07:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
sufficient thank you for the question
 
07:20:46.548 --> 07:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
representative so I do think that
 
07:20:50.448 --> 07:20:50.458 align:start position:0%
had I gone to had had I or will I you
 
07:20:52.490 --> 07:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
know if I were to go to court
 
07:20:55.670 --> 07:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
I would Prevail all right and and
 
07:20:57.590 --> 07:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
therefore you know the problem would be
 
07:21:00.110 --> 07:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
solved in that way but it would be very
 
07:21:03.350 --> 07:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
expensive and and you know you
 
07:21:04.788 --> 07:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
understand why I don't want to do that
 
07:21:07.070 --> 07:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
right I mean suing my own town it's
 
07:21:09.410 --> 07:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
crazy right but
 
07:21:11.628 --> 07:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
I do think that this will solve the
 
07:21:14.750 --> 07:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
problem in the sense that
 
07:21:16.968 --> 07:21:16.978 align:start position:0%
um I will go to either the selectman or
 
07:21:18.468 --> 07:21:18.478 align:start position:0%
the group of people that run the park
 
07:21:22.910 --> 07:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
and I will say you denied me so we put
 
07:21:26.570 --> 07:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
in I asked the legislature to please add
 
07:21:28.850 --> 07:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
this this little non-discriminatory
 
07:21:34.368 --> 07:21:34.378 align:start position:0%
section they did so and so this clearly
 
07:21:37.128 --> 07:21:37.138 align:start position:0%
covers the situation and you should
 
07:21:40.010 --> 07:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
remove the the Restriction from your
 
07:21:43.610 --> 07:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
application form that says you know you
 
07:21:45.468 --> 07:21:45.478 align:start position:0%
can't no political activity allowed
 
07:21:48.410 --> 07:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
right so so I don't think they're
 
07:21:50.390 --> 07:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
unreasonable people or something like
 
07:21:53.090 --> 07:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
that I just think they think they have
 
07:21:56.150 --> 07:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
control like it was their own you know
 
07:21:58.910 --> 07:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
sort of like it was they owned the park
 
07:22:01.070 --> 07:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
and they and they didn't want this to
 
07:22:03.110 --> 07:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
happen there therefore they can do
 
07:22:06.230 --> 07:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
things right and and and they don't
 
07:22:08.990 --> 07:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
really see it as
 
07:22:11.330 --> 07:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
um it's public property and therefore
 
07:22:13.090 --> 07:22:13.100 align:start position:0%
there's there's
 
07:22:15.890 --> 07:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory aspects to it you
 
07:22:17.330 --> 07:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
know so other questions yes
 
07:22:19.850 --> 07:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
representative page one one question and
 
07:22:22.250 --> 07:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
I apologize for the late hour but so
 
07:22:24.468 --> 07:22:24.478 align:start position:0%
let's say the legislature did pass this
 
07:22:26.750 --> 07:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
and you were able to go to town hall to
 
07:22:28.730 --> 07:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
Epsom and say look here's the statute
 
07:22:31.490 --> 07:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
and their response was well we didn't
 
07:22:33.350 --> 07:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
unlawfully discriminate we said the
 
07:22:34.850 --> 07:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
Democrats couldn't come either to the
 
07:22:38.030 --> 07:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
Pavilion what would be your remedy yeah
 
07:22:40.968 --> 07:22:40.978 align:start position:0%
so again thank you for the question I
 
07:22:42.288 --> 07:22:42.298 align:start position:0%
probably would
 
07:22:48.288 --> 07:22:48.298 align:start position:0%
have to go to court and Etc right but I
 
07:22:51.948 --> 07:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
like I said I I find I think that's very
 
07:22:51.958 --> 07:22:54.590 align:start position:0%
like I said I I find I think that's very
unlikely

07:22:54.590 --> 07:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
unlikely
 
07:22:57.468 --> 07:22:57.478 align:start position:0%
other question representative
 
07:23:00.288 --> 07:23:00.298 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify this is not
 
07:23:01.910 --> 07:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
that they're not saying that you can't
 
07:23:04.010 --> 07:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
use public property that you can go on
 
07:23:07.030 --> 07:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
to for any purpose it's
 
07:23:08.930 --> 07:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
Municipal property that you're actually
 
07:23:11.868 --> 07:23:11.878 align:start position:0%
renting for a specific purpose and
 
07:23:13.670 --> 07:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
you're giving like a fee agreement to
 
07:23:15.230 --> 07:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
rent it and so it wouldn't be public
 
07:23:17.208 --> 07:23:17.218 align:start position:0%
property that anybody could just walk on
 
07:23:20.150 --> 07:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
to to use anyways because you have to
 
07:23:22.548 --> 07:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
rent it for that purpose is that correct
 
07:23:24.350 --> 07:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
07:23:27.948 --> 07:23:27.958 align:start position:0%
yes in the sense that
 
07:23:31.910 --> 07:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
um our town wants to have insurance and
 
07:23:34.730 --> 07:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
and charge for using this particular
 
07:23:38.150 --> 07:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
thing and presumably if we simply went
 
07:23:40.968 --> 07:23:40.978 align:start position:0%
there and had a picnic and it was
 
07:23:42.890 --> 07:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
sizable enough they would chase us away
 
07:23:44.890 --> 07:23:44.900 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
07:23:48.190 --> 07:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
but I don't
 
07:23:51.770 --> 07:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
but it well yeah so I so yes I mean this
 
07:23:54.288 --> 07:23:54.298 align:start position:0%
is this is public property
 
07:23:56.750 --> 07:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
um they use it for public events all the
 
07:23:59.570 --> 07:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
time old home day being one
 
07:24:02.390 --> 07:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
um but when when individuals or groups
 
07:24:04.730 --> 07:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
want to use it then there's a form and
 
07:24:07.070 --> 07:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's a charge and you know all that
 
07:24:08.690 --> 07:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff
 
07:24:10.368 --> 07:24:10.378 align:start position:0%
exchange for this Witness
 
07:24:10.378 --> 07:24:11.390 align:start position:0%
exchange for this Witness
so

07:24:11.390 --> 07:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:24:13.128 --> 07:24:13.138 align:start position:0%
um I've seen that I I do have two
 
07:24:15.770 --> 07:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Maguire the
 
07:24:18.230 --> 07:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
first question I have is and this is
 
07:24:20.810 --> 07:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
this happens
 
07:24:22.990 --> 07:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
um uh a lot you you put the word
 
07:24:27.410 --> 07:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
unlawfully in paragraph one or Roman
 
07:24:28.430 --> 07:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
numeral one
 
07:24:30.288 --> 07:24:30.298 align:start position:0%
and I wonder
 
07:24:32.570 --> 07:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm really concerned about
 
07:24:34.730 --> 07:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
is it says no municipality shall
 
07:24:37.910 --> 07:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
unlawfully discriminate well
 
07:24:42.468 --> 07:24:42.478 align:start position:0%
it's only I mean that's that's it's
 
07:24:44.628 --> 07:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
unlocked unlawfully doesn't refer to
 
07:24:47.868 --> 07:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
something else it refers to this law is
 
07:24:49.430 --> 07:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
what makes it unlawful right I mean it's
 
07:24:52.190 --> 07:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
not something else yes thank you very
 
07:24:55.730 --> 07:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
much for the question Mr chairman so I
 
07:24:59.810 --> 07:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
asked the drafter exactly that because I
 
07:25:02.330 --> 07:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
I thought we should take out the word
 
07:25:04.730 --> 07:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
unlawfully and and shall not
 
07:25:08.330 --> 07:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
discriminate right and the drafter said
 
07:25:08.340 --> 07:25:10.250 align:start position:0%
discriminate right and the drafter said
that

07:25:10.250 --> 07:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:25:14.208 --> 07:25:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:16.670 --> 07:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's this is kind of a known word
 
07:25:19.368 --> 07:25:19.378 align:start position:0%
and if he took that out he would have to
 
07:25:21.830 --> 07:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
say shall not discriminate on a
 
07:25:24.890 --> 07:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
religious basis or or a political basis
 
07:25:28.368 --> 07:25:28.378 align:start position:0%
or this basis or that basis all the all
 
07:25:30.110 --> 07:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
the the giant list of things you can't
 
07:25:34.070 --> 07:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
discriminate against so so personally I
 
07:25:35.930 --> 07:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
think you don't need that word all right
 
07:25:38.930 --> 07:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
but the drafter thinks you do so that's
 
07:25:40.548 --> 07:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
that's the way we ended you know and I
 
07:25:42.770 --> 07:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
felt like they knew better than I did so
 
07:25:46.190 --> 07:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
if you think you know and obviously you
 
07:25:49.090 --> 07:25:49.100 align:start position:0%
know your committee is just as
 
07:25:51.948 --> 07:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
familiar with with this kind of law as
 
07:25:54.530 --> 07:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
the drafter I think so I would be with
 
07:25:56.810 --> 07:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
you and say take it out but it's up to
 
07:25:59.868 --> 07:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
you the other question I have and it
 
07:26:02.150 --> 07:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
sort of I think goes along at least a
 
07:26:03.650 --> 07:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
little bit to what what representative
 
07:26:07.250 --> 07:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
Manos was saying is this if the way I'm
 
07:26:09.708 --> 07:26:09.718 align:start position:0%
concerned about the broadness of the
 
07:26:11.330 --> 07:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
wording so
 
07:26:11.340 --> 07:26:12.410 align:start position:0%
wording so
um

07:26:12.410 --> 07:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:14.150 --> 07:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
if you
 
07:26:16.788 --> 07:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
um so it says let's let's assume we did
 
07:26:19.070 --> 07:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
take out the word municip unlawfully so
 
07:26:21.230 --> 07:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
no municipality shall discriminate
 
07:26:23.030 --> 07:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
against any individual or group in the
 
07:26:25.610 --> 07:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
use of of a municipal facility on the
 
07:26:28.368 --> 07:26:28.378 align:start position:0%
basis of the individual individuals or
 
07:26:31.010 --> 07:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
groups speech or purpose
 
07:26:31.020 --> 07:26:32.510 align:start position:0%
groups speech or purpose
so

07:26:32.510 --> 07:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:26:35.150 --> 07:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm I'm concerned about is
 
07:26:37.190 --> 07:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
what if
 
07:26:39.890 --> 07:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
what if a group says
 
07:26:43.610 --> 07:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:47.570 --> 07:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
we want to walk down Main Street in the
 
07:26:49.730 --> 07:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
in your town you know in the middle of
 
07:26:53.270 --> 07:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
the road on Monday morning at rush hour
 
07:26:55.968 --> 07:26:55.978 align:start position:0%
um and to you know for political reason
 
07:26:58.730 --> 07:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
or whatever for whatever reason to
 
07:27:02.270 --> 07:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
advertise Snickers and that's what they
 
07:27:03.410 --> 07:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
um would
 
07:27:05.208 --> 07:27:05.218 align:start position:0%
would the
 
07:27:09.070 --> 07:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
would the town be required to allow that
 
07:27:12.770 --> 07:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
because it because the under definition
 
07:27:16.128 --> 07:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
of Municipal Municipal facility under
 
07:27:19.430 --> 07:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
two it says that um
 
07:27:22.128 --> 07:27:22.138 align:start position:0%
um I see you're objecting to the word
 
07:27:22.138 --> 07:27:23.390 align:start position:0%
um I see you're objecting to the word
purpose

07:27:23.390 --> 07:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
07:27:26.690 --> 07:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
I guess so thank you Mr chairman so so
 
07:27:32.090 --> 07:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:36.048 --> 07:27:36.058 align:start position:0%
the beach is the to me the key word here
 
07:27:39.250 --> 07:27:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:41.570 --> 07:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean
 
07:27:44.990 --> 07:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
you want to sure I I would agree you
 
07:27:47.090 --> 07:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
can't block traffic right or something
 
07:27:49.968 --> 07:27:49.978 align:start position:0%
like that right I mean it's not what's
 
07:27:53.750 --> 07:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
happening to us is it's a normal use of
 
07:27:56.208 --> 07:27:56.218 align:start position:0%
a normal thing and we're being
 
07:27:58.448 --> 07:27:58.458 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
 
07:28:01.788 --> 07:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
based on what we want to say in that
 
07:28:04.788 --> 07:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
location right and so to me the speech
 
07:28:07.190 --> 07:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
is the key part of that
 
07:28:09.530 --> 07:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
um and and if you want to eliminate
 
07:28:11.750 --> 07:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
purpose I would think it's okay but
 
07:28:14.030 --> 07:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
again the drafter right so you know what
 
07:28:16.310 --> 07:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
I'm really wondering is wouldn't it be
 
07:28:18.708 --> 07:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
better if the language said something
 
07:28:21.048 --> 07:28:21.058 align:start position:0%
like I mean to be more more direct and
 
07:28:24.430 --> 07:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
sort of say no municipality
 
07:28:26.810 --> 07:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
shall prohibit
 
07:28:30.250 --> 07:28:30.260 align:start position:0%
the use of facilities
 
07:28:34.490 --> 07:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
for political rallies if the facilities
 
07:28:38.810 --> 07:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
are allowed to be used for other for
 
07:28:42.430 --> 07:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
other purposes that you know involve
 
07:28:46.670 --> 07:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
similar size uh activity or I'm not sure
 
07:28:49.070 --> 07:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
exactly but in other words so there
 
07:28:52.490 --> 07:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
can't be any discrimination against
 
07:28:55.750 --> 07:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a political rally versus
 
07:28:58.208 --> 07:28:58.218 align:start position:0%
some non-political
 
07:29:01.570 --> 07:29:01.580 align:start position:0%
activity yes thank you Mr chairman so
 
07:29:04.010 --> 07:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
that would certainly I would think that
 
07:29:06.410 --> 07:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
that would solve my problem
 
07:29:10.310 --> 07:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
um I thought that writing it in a
 
07:29:12.350 --> 07:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
slightly more General way could
 
07:29:14.270 --> 07:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
potentially solve other potential
 
07:29:18.048 --> 07:29:18.058 align:start position:0%
problems right so so that's why we did
 
07:29:21.170 --> 07:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
it this way so it's really up to you
 
07:29:24.048 --> 07:29:24.058 align:start position:0%
that's fine representative Schmidt
 
07:29:26.330 --> 07:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
I know everybody wants to go home I
 
07:29:29.410 --> 07:29:29.420 align:start position:0%
understand that and but
 
07:29:32.570 --> 07:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative who
 
07:29:36.110 --> 07:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
who appoints or elects the park board
 
07:29:38.030 --> 07:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
whatever the title is
 
07:29:42.410 --> 07:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
I I believe it's the selectman select me
 
07:29:45.350 --> 07:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
has the thought occurred to you
 
07:29:48.830 --> 07:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
that you might go to the selectman and
 
07:29:48.840 --> 07:29:50.090 align:start position:0%
that you might go to the selectman and
say

07:29:50.090 --> 07:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
say
 
07:29:54.708 --> 07:29:54.718 align:start position:0%
this board that you appointed has made a
 
07:29:57.708 --> 07:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
decision which really doesn't hang
 
07:29:57.718 --> 07:29:58.910 align:start position:0%
decision which really doesn't hang
together

07:29:58.910 --> 07:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
together
 
07:30:02.570 --> 07:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
and how do you think we can address this
 
07:30:05.270 --> 07:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
problem in the wonderful town of Epsom
 
07:30:07.610 --> 07:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
without having
 
07:30:11.390 --> 07:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
to create new law yeah thank thank you
 
07:30:14.150 --> 07:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
for the question and essentially I've
 
07:30:16.010 --> 07:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
done that I've talked to one to one
 
07:30:20.150 --> 07:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
selectman and it didn't really get
 
07:30:23.090 --> 07:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
um a satisfaction but
 
07:30:25.190 --> 07:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
um because of
 
07:30:27.708 --> 07:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
maybe because of relationships and other
 
07:30:30.288 --> 07:30:30.298 align:start position:0%
stuff between the the individuals right
 
07:30:30.298 --> 07:30:31.850 align:start position:0%
stuff between the the individuals right
so

07:30:31.850 --> 07:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:30:34.128 --> 07:30:34.138 align:start position:0%
um but I could try harder I mean sure
 
07:30:34.138 --> 07:30:35.510 align:start position:0%
um but I could try harder I mean sure
yeah

07:30:35.510 --> 07:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:30:37.670 --> 07:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative kuta
 
07:30:39.530 --> 07:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
so I have another question just about
 
07:30:42.048 --> 07:30:42.058 align:start position:0%
the language so I know for example in my
 
07:30:43.850 --> 07:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
town because you're saying regardless of
 
07:30:47.090 --> 07:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
purpose in my town if your purpose is
 
07:30:49.128 --> 07:30:49.138 align:start position:0%
non-alcoholic for example they don't
 
07:30:53.150 --> 07:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
require Insurance however if you plan on
 
07:30:55.670 --> 07:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
serving alcohol at the event then you
 
07:30:59.030 --> 07:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
would have to have insurance and so
 
07:31:00.830 --> 07:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit
 
07:31:02.448 --> 07:31:02.458 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to say discriminatory
 
07:31:04.430 --> 07:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
but it kind of is like in that depending
 
07:31:06.350 --> 07:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
on the purpose of the event there's
 
07:31:08.090 --> 07:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
different requirements for the event and
 
07:31:10.730 --> 07:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
I feel like this would kind of say no
 
07:31:12.948 --> 07:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
you can't do that thank you for the
 
07:31:14.990 --> 07:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
question representative and I have a
 
07:31:17.448 --> 07:31:17.458 align:start position:0%
feeling that this is what you're the
 
07:31:20.208 --> 07:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
kind of things you're bringing up is why
 
07:31:21.590 --> 07:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
the drafts are put in the word
 
07:31:21.600 --> 07:31:23.090 align:start position:0%
the drafts are put in the word
unlawfully

07:31:23.090 --> 07:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
unlawfully
 
07:31:23.100 --> 07:31:24.708 align:start position:0%
unlawfully
because

07:31:24.708 --> 07:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:31:27.770 --> 07:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
all those kind of discriminations
 
07:31:29.930 --> 07:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
there's nothing unlawful about them
 
07:31:33.890 --> 07:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
right but discriminating on the basis of
 
07:31:37.750 --> 07:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
religion and speech and
 
07:31:40.490 --> 07:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know racism and all this kind of
 
07:31:42.788 --> 07:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
stuff those are unlawful discriminations
 
07:31:45.708 --> 07:31:45.718 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's what the drafter
 
07:31:49.010 --> 07:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
had in mind when they wrote it this way
 
07:31:52.490 --> 07:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
thing any other questions for uh yes uh
 
07:31:54.048 --> 07:31:54.058 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
07:31:56.330 --> 07:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
07:31:58.250 --> 07:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
my question I thought I'd chime in here
 
07:32:00.048 --> 07:32:00.058 align:start position:0%
so everybody knows I at least have a
 
07:32:00.058 --> 07:32:02.390 align:start position:0%
so everybody knows I at least have a
voice

07:32:02.390 --> 07:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:02.400 --> 07:32:03.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:32:03.530 --> 07:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:06.890 --> 07:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
purpose is too broad creates problems if
 
07:32:08.930 --> 07:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
you put the word political purpose in
 
07:32:11.750 --> 07:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
front of it it might clarify it but also
 
07:32:15.650 --> 07:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
make some other problems what about that
 
07:32:17.570 --> 07:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
07:32:20.390 --> 07:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative again I I agree with you
 
07:32:23.208 --> 07:32:23.218 align:start position:0%
that that would make it solve my
 
07:32:26.750 --> 07:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
particular one example but it it seems
 
07:32:28.548 --> 07:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
to me I could probably think of other
 
07:32:32.510 --> 07:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
other examples that
 
07:32:32.520 --> 07:32:33.548 align:start position:0%
other examples that
um

07:32:33.548 --> 07:32:33.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:36.590 --> 07:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
people are being could be discriminated
 
07:32:39.830 --> 07:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
against and and they're non-political
 
07:32:39.840 --> 07:32:41.570 align:start position:0%
against and and they're non-political
right

07:32:41.570 --> 07:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:32:46.390 --> 07:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know maybe uh
 
07:32:48.590 --> 07:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know if somebody wanted to have
 
07:32:51.288 --> 07:32:51.298 align:start position:0%
a girls event maybe instead of a boys
 
07:32:54.350 --> 07:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
and exclude boys or something
 
07:32:54.360 --> 07:32:55.788 align:start position:0%
and exclude boys or something
um

07:32:55.788 --> 07:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:58.070 --> 07:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
there might be other other kinds of
 
07:32:59.628 --> 07:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
discrimination that's that's not
 
07:33:02.090 --> 07:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
political right
 
07:33:04.250 --> 07:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
07:33:05.930 --> 07:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
 
07:33:08.628 --> 07:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman is there anyone else who
 
07:33:13.930 --> 07:33:13.940 align:start position:0%
uh desires to uh testify on HB 256.
 
07:33:17.208 --> 07:33:17.218 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the here
 
07:33:19.910 --> 07:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
I want you to understand I am I well you
 
07:33:21.530 --> 07:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
know what let me just ask I am not a
 
07:33:22.850 --> 07:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
glutton I want you to understand that
 
07:33:24.948 --> 07:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
and please don't please don't attack me
 
07:33:27.708 --> 07:33:27.718 align:start position:0%
I just want to raise one issue it
 
07:33:29.930 --> 07:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
appeared that representative Smith and
 
07:33:32.868 --> 07:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
myself were of the same view that one
 
07:33:35.570 --> 07:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
particular bill could be exact now but
 
07:33:37.490 --> 07:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
given the hour my suggestion would be
 
07:33:40.990 --> 07:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
that we not do that members have left
 
07:33:44.510 --> 07:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
right right so that's you yeah no no no
 
07:33:47.570 --> 07:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:50.890 --> 07:33:50.900 align:start position:0%
others would have liked to have left
 
07:33:54.288 --> 07:33:54.298 align:start position:0%
so so I will entertain a motion to
 
07:33:54.298 --> 07:33:56.270 align:start position:0%
so so I will entertain a motion to
adjourn

07:33:56.270 --> 07:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
adjourn
 
07:33:58.548 --> 07:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
all right all in favor
 
07:34:17.890 --> 07:34:17.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:21.590 --> 07:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:21.600 --> 07:34:30.968 align:start position:0%
 
again

07:34:30.968 --> 07:34:30.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:30.978 --> 07:34:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

07:34:35.590 --> 07:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
