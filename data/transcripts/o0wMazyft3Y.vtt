00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
welcome to the February 24th meeting of
 
00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 align:start position:0%
the Health Human Services oversight
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee I do not believe that we have
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
a quorum so I would suggest we dispense
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
until next time with the reading of the
 
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
minutes since we can't vote on them
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
one of the great features of this
 
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
foreign since we have a quorum please
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
take the minutes from the February 3rd
 
00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 align:start position:0%
meeting look over them very quickly to
 
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
we're reading over the minutes from last
 
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
a comment representative Edwards
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
um okay it's not that big a deal I don't
 
00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 align:start position:0%
think but before I
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
left that day I think we were on the
 
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
child fatality Review Committee and I
 
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
thought we had a decent discussion uh as
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
short as it was regarding
 
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.629 align:start position:0%
short as it was regarding
um

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 align:start position:0%
doctors giving advice on
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
Firearms do you think that that's
 
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
covered adequately in the first
 
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.350 align:start position:0%
covered adequately in the first
paragraph

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
the director gave a report on suicides
 
00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 align:start position:0%
and what the committee has found the
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
results indicate suicide by hanging
 
00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
Firearms what would you propose we add
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
as a sentence that would
 
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
I I I'd say that we we opened up a
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
cautionary note that uh
 
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.710 align:start position:0%
cautionary note that uh
clinicians

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
clinicians
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
ought to be judicious and when they
 
00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:44.950 align:start position:0%
ought to be judicious and when they
counsel

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
patients and ask questions of their
 
00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.089 align:start position:0%
patients and ask questions of their
Pediatric

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:49.099 align:start position:0%
Pediatric
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
patients regarding gun possession in the
 
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.230 align:start position:0%
patients regarding gun possession in the
house

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
care to attribute that to somebody
 
00:07:58.249 --> 00:07:58.259 align:start position:0%
because I don't
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
I didn't participate in that sentiment
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to be associated with
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
it that was me okay
 
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
that was definitely me if that's
 
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259 align:start position:0%
attached to your name then I have no
 
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
objection at all to adding it to the
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
minutes right
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
and later when I talked to Miss Tilly
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
she had a great reason for why it was
 
00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:22.379 align:start position:0%
important if the child is suicidal for
 
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
example it's a perfectly great
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
conversation to have but but still the
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
clinician and patient relationship is
 
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
really reliant on trust and some
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
anything else yes representative can you
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
repeat how you'd like that said in a
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
minute so I can catch it if if you'll
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
allow me I'll uh I'll I I can't
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
talk and think but the words jump out of
 
00:08:59.449 --> 00:08:59.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
would you accept a cautionary note was
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
raised that clinicians be judicious in
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
asking gun possession questions in
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
uh their young patients
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
plural possessive home no because that
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
attributes that sentiment to all members
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
don't share them representative asked
 
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards asked
 
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think he asked I think he stated
 
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
because I was leaving I I did state it
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
and I think it ended up in a
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
conversation after I left
 
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
a cautionary note
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
that clinicians be judicious in asking
 
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
gun possession questions of their young
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
patients is home
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
seeing hearing nothing else could I have
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
a motion to approve the minutes with
 
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:40.580 align:start position:0%
that Amendment
 
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
second representative McDonald moves
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%

00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:46.790 align:start position:0%

thank you the minutes are accepted
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
and now the reason we all drive here the
 
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
update from
 
00:10:59.329 --> 00:10:59.339 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
lessons from Laurie
 
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
good morning that's quite a expectation
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
um well I good morning uh committee I
 
00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:18.779 align:start position:0%
have a pretty robust
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
update uh this morning via channeling uh
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
director Henry Littman from our Medicaid
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
Program we'll be talking about the
 
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
unwind coverage as well as covering some
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
of the adult Dental the recent
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and some rate discussion so
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty robust discussion I'm
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to have Henry and Karen come up to
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
start to talk about the unwind of the
 
00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
though this is not a good place to
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:17.459 align:start position:0%
good morning again Henry Littman
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director for the record
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Karen Hebert I'm
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
the director for the division of
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
economic stability thank you
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
so I just open up
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
just sort of set the set where we are
 
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
um as you know
 
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.130 align:start position:0%
um as you know
um

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program today has the
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
largest enrollment I think ever in the
 
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:48.500 align:start position:0%
history of the program because of
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
the continuous coverage requirements
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
first under the federal Public Health
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
Emergency and secondarily under the
 
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
Consolidated appropriation act which was
 
00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
passed at the end of the year that act
 
00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:05.110 align:start position:0%
passed at the end of the year that act
um

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
bifurcates continuous enrollment from
 
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
the public health emergency and defines
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
a a date certain in which states can
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
begin to unwind
 
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.470 align:start position:0%
begin to unwind
um

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to report that
 
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.829 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to report that
um

00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
before states can actually initiate this
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
activity they have to go through a
 
00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:28.459 align:start position:0%
process of sharing with
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
CMS centers for Medicaid Medicare
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
services that they have the systems and
 
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:38.060 align:start position:0%
things in place in order to do this
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
that states could begin at the earliest
 
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
disenrolling people April 1st I think
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is in the top quartile and
 
00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
being able to begin early and that many
 
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:50.459 align:start position:0%
states are going to need mitigation
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
plans before they can begin so I think
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
in terms of Ready set go in terms of
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
being able to to begin the process where
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
physician and actually are are executing
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
as we're speaking today the process is
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
starting to move
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the
 
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
the slide deck uh I'm not going to try
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
to cover every single slide in this deck
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
and I think you can just kind of run to
 
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
slide five gives you the state of
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment as of January 30th
 
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.389 align:start position:0%
enrollment as of January 30th
um

00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
let everybody catch up with make sure
 
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
that the number is kind of small on the
 
00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
everybody's with that with me at this
 
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.370 align:start position:0%
everybody's with that with me at this
point

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
um the standard Medicaid Program has
 
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
grown by about 20 percent since the end
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
of February of 19 basically the
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
effective beginning of when the
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment began in March and
 
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
the granite Advantage program has grown
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
86 percent
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
um in total the whole program has grown
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
by almost 40 percent 39 percent
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
um where probably if you look at our
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
enrollment today we're just over 250
 
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.889 align:start position:0%
enrollment today we're just over 250
000.

00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
000.
 
00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:07.610 align:start position:0%
000.
um

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:11.660 align:start position:0%
so just on the bottom of uh slide six
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
there's some important definitions here
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
today the continuous enrollment is
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
protecting just under 102 000
 
00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
individuals were not for the continuous
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
enrollment would would no longer likely
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
be on the program
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
um they're sort of fall into two groups
 
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
of people one is the group of people
 
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.689 align:start position:0%
of people one is the group of people
that

00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:36.530 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
were were not for the for the continuous
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment and not completing their
 
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.410 align:start position:0%
enrollment and not completing their
eligibility

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
um paperwork would have been disenrolled
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
and that's about
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
um not how the slide coming ahead on
 
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
that that's about 73 000 people almost
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then there's a group called pending
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
and eligible people who did complete
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
their redetermination
 
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
and um currently
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
um are protected in the sense that
 
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're no longer
 
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
eligible but are protected by continuous
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment so they may be over income as
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
so if you turn to the next page of
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
a question would you mind taking a
 
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
question would you prefer to wait me to
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
wait till you finish I'm happy to go
 
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
however the committee would like so am I
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
a right in thinking that the pending and
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
eligible are the people who we are
 
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.910 align:start position:0%
eligible are the people who we are
unwinding

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
unwinding
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
or that we will be unwinding first or I
 
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
think I'll get to that one second thank
 
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
you so
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
just to to get the population
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
um for you in terms of that what I just
 
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
sort of described is at the top of the
 
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
page is described as in the um
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
counting individuals if you look on
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
opposite side it's counted as households
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
our approach to working this is actually
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
to do it by household because why make a
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
household go through three or four
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
different redetermination processes to
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
do it as a as a group on the bottom uh
 
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
slide eight which is sort of the purple
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
and green and blue colored slide it's
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
basically who of that hundred and one
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
thousand where they where do they exist
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
and as you might expect because the the
 
00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
largest growth was in the granite
 
00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:23.459 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program the largest group of
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
people that have had a protected status
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
are people in the the Medicaid expansion
 
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:30.419 align:start position:0%
the concerning group for us I think is
 
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:33.140 align:start position:0%
the children the almost 35 000 children
 
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.669 align:start position:0%
the children the almost 35 000 children
where

00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we've done significant
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
Outreach and actually you know Karen's
 
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:38.930 align:start position:0%
Outreach and actually you know Karen's
team

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
team
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
um maybe Karen you could speak to all
 
00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:42.860 align:start position:0%
the Outreach that you've done but we've
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
some states stopped doing regular work
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
we never did
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
um and we got over 32 000 people to
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
voluntarily complete their
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
redeterminations and now over 2400
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
people have told us
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
um based on proactive asking if you will
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
um do you need Medicaid coverage anymore
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
and people come forward and said we've
 
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
got something else we don't need it
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
anymore so we've been able to to deal
 
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.610 align:start position:0%
anymore so we've been able to to deal
with

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
um you know over 34 000 cases which that
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
hundred and hundred and 2000 would have
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
been almost a hundred and you know
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
thirty five thousand hundred thirty six
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
thousand otherwise Karen you might share
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what your team has
 
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
done and they've done a great job sure
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:29.810 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
so this for the Department I oversee the
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
Bureau of family assistance is one of
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
the areas of the division and that
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
contains all of the staff who conduct
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
the eligibility processing so they
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
receive applications they receive
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
renewal applications and process all the
 
00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:51.190 align:start position:0%
renewal applications and process all the
verification

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
verification
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
documents for folks to determine their
 
00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:55.490 align:start position:0%
documents for folks to determine their
eligibility

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.870 align:start position:0%
eligibility
so

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
that particular it's a large group of
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
Staff they are in all of our district
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
offices across the state and I will say
 
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
that I'm incredibly proud of them for
 
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
the work that they are doing to get
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
ready for this this is all about
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
operational Readiness because we've
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
never done this before this is
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
unprecedented volume of work that we are
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
anticipating from our constituents from
 
00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:24.620 align:start position:0%
our citizenry Medicaid beneficiaries who
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
we've been trying
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh a number of strategies to reach out
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
to each of these individuals to make
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
sure that they understand what's
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
happening during the continuous
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
enrollment process but even more so now
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
that we have a date where that
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment is ending
 
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
so the Outreach that we've conducted
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
we've reached I believe over 40 000
 
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
families that our staff have reached out
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
to to make sure that they are aware of
 
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:57.539 align:start position:0%
what they need to do that they
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
understand the instructions we've been
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
working with
 
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
a number of the providers as well across
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
the state we have office hours if you
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
will for them a number of them that they
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
can contact us to talk about the clients
 
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
that we have in common to help them so
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're actually having a lot of the
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
provider groups help us as well to do a
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
lot of this Outreach
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
because we can't do it alone so we've
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
really been partnering significantly
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
with those provider groups to make sure
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
that they can help us do a lot of this
 
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.789 align:start position:0%
that they can help us do a lot of this
Outreach

00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
Outreach
 
00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.230 align:start position:0%
Outreach
um

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
we've also been putting together some
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
new workload distribution plans to end
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
up process processing as much as we can
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
as quickly as we can this is all about
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
capacity and how do we increase that
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
capacity to make sure that nobody
 
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
or as very few possible people as
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%
possible experience any kind of Gap in
 
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
coverage or lose their coverage we don't
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
want people to learn or figure this out
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
while they're in the checkout line at
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
the doctor's office or the pharmacy so
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
these are concerns that we have had all
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
along and trying to prepare
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
for this process for this volume we've
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
done a lot of simulated activities as
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
well just to test our own Readiness and
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
foreign we've also engaged the Managed
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
Care organizations in this and and part
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
of what we've done is we've given them
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
lists of their where they have a patient
 
00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:40.610 align:start position:0%
lists of their where they have a patient
relationship

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and where a like a mental health
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
center or a federally qualified Health
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
Center in our area agency a hospital
 
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
what have you
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
um we give them a list of their patients
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
with what their redetermination date is
 
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
and what type of of things are they
 
00:21:57.529 --> 00:21:57.539 align:start position:0%
missing to complete their
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
redetermination and and we've been doing
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
this um you know for going on two years
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
now trying to get people to do it
 
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
voluntarily in advance as well as now
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
get into this in a moment here part of
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
the the process that states have to
 
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
follow to um if you go to topless next
 
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
page top of that slide 11 on the right
 
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
hand corner is that to earn the extra
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
several matching percentage the federal
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
medical assistance fmap as we call it it
 
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.390 align:start position:0%
medical assistance fmap as we call it it
which

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
up to this point the additional Federal
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
monies we've received has allowed us to
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of the the extra
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment so the state hasn't had to if
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
you will incur extra
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
General funds to support the program but
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
that extra money is going to be
 
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
phased down and which is why because New
 
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.750 align:start position:0%
phased down and which is why because New
Hampshire

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
compared to some states like take a
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
state like New Mexico as an example they
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
have a much higher Federal matching
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
percentage because their poverty level
 
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
is among the highest in the in the
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
country so states that are more
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
um well New Hampshire has a good economy
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
right and and some good wage here that
 
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
we're we're at the minimum fmap for
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid which is 50 all states
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
get the 90 for the for the expansion
 
00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
population but in order to to actually
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
draw these funds you have to follow
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a guidance and the guidance
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
is intended to return to normal
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
operations in the sense of that we don't
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
want a big bolus of redeterminations all
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
in one month that we're not going to be
 
00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:45.419 align:start position:0%
able to handle in future years they're
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get states to get back to you
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
know having a normal distribution so
 
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:51.980 align:start position:0%
what we had to do
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
is of those people that's that 73 000
 
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
roughly of individuals we had to map out
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
new redetermination dates for them so
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
that if you go to the bottom of slide 14
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
is this is a sort of the spread of how
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
we get back to normal within a year's
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
time and I'm gonna talk a little bit
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
more about this on a subsequent slide
 
00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:21.539 align:start position:0%
but basically this is part of our plan
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
that we had to have approved showing
 
00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:27.539 align:start position:0%
that we had a plan to get back to normal
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of a reasonable distribution as
 
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
well as followed other things like
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
making sure that we followed
 
00:24:34.919 --> 00:24:35.510 align:start position:0%
making sure that we followed
um

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
you know the normal noticing the normal
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
decisions giving the right of appeal all
 
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing process procedural
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
things that people are entitled to for
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
rights uh
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
um and I'll jump over to
 
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.490 align:start position:0%
um and I'll jump over to
um

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
the top of uh I'll skip the next page
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
because we've kind of talked through
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
that the slide title percent of
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
population with no provider payments the
 
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.529 align:start position:0%
population with no provider payments the
way

00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:00.539 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:25:00.539 --> 00:25:02.090 align:start position:0%
way
um

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
and and then the monthly distribution
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
these are really two important slides if
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
you to to understand kind of what's
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
um so when we needed to distribute the
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
population over a one-ninth um basis we
 
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
said what's what's the way to go about
 
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
this so that
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
um we did it sort of on a risk basis you
 
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
know some states are just doing it you
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
know just across the board we try to
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
take an additional level of sensitivity
 
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
both from a financial and a clinical
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
perspective so what we did is we
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
analyzed all our enrollment and looked
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
at trying to put first those people who
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
haven't used health care very much or at
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
all and so they're more likely to not be
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
harmed by being disenrolled versus for
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
example someone who's a hemophiliac or
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
um has other you know serious medical
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
conditions that moving those people
 
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
further out into the
 
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
um into the unwind because they're most
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
likely to likely qualify and a gap in in
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
health care coverage is more likely to
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
do harm to them
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
and then this all falls down to this
 
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh what we is our estimated plan of how
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
this is all going to work out
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Edwards
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr lookman um we're going to
 
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
hit this in more detail on division
 
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
three so so I'm not looking for a
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
detailed answer here but I can't help
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
but to think as you're going through
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
this that one this is tremendous work uh
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
but then I get into wondering about
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
the Manpower required to be planning
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
this and executing this and the
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
availability of any I.T system support
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
that's making it easier or harder for
 
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
that's making it easier or harder for
you

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
and and then and then that leads me into
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
thinking well what about the mcos how
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
much are the mcos having to invest
 
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
Manpower and time into this as well and
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
I I guess I guess the kind of answer I'm
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
looking for is
 
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.430 align:start position:0%
looking for is
um

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
is this really pushing your organization
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
your manpower to where you're largely
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
maxed out on your capacity to manage
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
this much change or do you feel like you
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
are doing this easily in stride
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
so I guess it's sort of a two-part
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
answer I think we've been working this
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
since July of 2020 we've been planning
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
and fortunately a lot of the Investments
 
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
that the state had previously made in
 
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
its eligibility system that
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
um the reason we're sort of ready to
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
begin anyways is that that we're
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
leveraged off what we've had we've been
 
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
I think we're in a good shape what
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
what's the unknown for example is
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
um is like the appeal process how many
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
people are going to
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
um appeal are we going to get is there
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
going to be a place where we
 
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
you know get held up a little bit
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
because of of people just taking
 
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
advantage of appeal rights when there
 
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
may not be any
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
um ability for them to maintain coverage
 
00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
so I guess our answer up to this point I
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
think it's been you know stressed us but
 
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
I think that we've tried to manage this
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
so that we don't get overwhelmed which
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
is to say since we've never done
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
something this big we do have some
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
concerns that we could as we you know
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
particularly at the beginning when we're
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
moving a lot of people off you know do
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
we have the workforce to handle all the
 
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
incoming information but we've tried to
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
beef up for that
 
00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
if I may please
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so there has
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
been a lot of concern about our capacity
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
to be able to process what's coming so
 
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
we've been working very hard at coming
 
00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
up with a number of different strategies
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
to try to ensure that we could process
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
this as quickly as we possibly can and
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
as effectively as we can we've been
 
00:29:11.169 --> 00:29:11.179 align:start position:0%
bringing in for example
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
individuals who still work for the
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
Department perhap perhaps were formally
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
an eligibility worker to work an
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
overtime project so that we are able to
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
make use of other resources in the
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
department that are willing to help us
 
00:29:29.529 --> 00:29:29.539 align:start position:0%
with these efforts
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
we have strategies with respect to new
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
hires where we would train them first on
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
how to conduct redeterminations so that
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
they can focus solely on that we've
 
00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
distributed or redistributed caseloads
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
so that we focus on this protected
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
population within one particular office
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
if you will so different ways that we're
 
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
trying to increase our own capacity it
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
also includes the procurement of a call
 
00:29:59.950 --> 00:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
center so right now we have a current
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
temporary call center which contract
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
expires in June terrible timing for that
 
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
but we've been procuring a new call
 
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:10.580 align:start position:0%
center that we're adding a lot of
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
functionality to including being able to
 
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:15.419 align:start position:0%
conduct some of the Outreach and other
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
administrative processes for us and
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
we're wanting to stand that up by July
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
1st so that they are ready to answer the
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
phone by July 1st that process is going
 
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.870 align:start position:0%
phone by July 1st that process is going
well

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.090 align:start position:0%
well
um

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
staff have been
 
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.630 align:start position:0%
staff have been
um

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier I'm very proud of them
 
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
having really facing this with the right
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
attitude that they've got this that
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
makes all the difference in the world so
 
00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
I'm confident in them even though we're
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
a little bit apprehensive of not knowing
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
quite what to expect and we're going to
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
monitor and evaluate this constantly and
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
just see how it goes and where we may be
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
able to make some adjustments
 
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:01.220 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate all of that and and I'm
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm oversimplifying this I I'm
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
really trying to understand is the
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
capacity that you have with all your
 
00:31:14.769 --> 00:31:14.779 align:start position:0%
planning and everything
 
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be pegged out or do you
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
think you have additional flexibility in
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
your system for some other exigency to
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
think that you know we try to keep
 
00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
some strategies in the back pocket if
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
they be effective it's a bit unknown
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
this is really unpredictable so I can't
 
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
say that you know we are solid on how
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
this is going to go
 
00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:44.510 align:start position:0%
this is going to go
um

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that we'll just do the
 
00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
representative Weber could I ask the
 
00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299 align:start position:0%
same question a different way
 
00:31:57.299 --> 00:31:59.330 align:start position:0%
same question a different way
um

00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
do you feel you are adequately staffed
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
right now or understaffed right now uh
 
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
for both what you know today
 
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
and going forward into the future
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
I I believe that we are I think our if I
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
were to diagnose where I think we
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
um are concerned where we may need some
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
more resources and we're working on
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
putting together a plan there because
 
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
it's sort of where's our weak spot is on
 
00:32:29.169 --> 00:32:29.179 align:start position:0%
the appeals and what we can do to
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
minimize you know in some cases there's
 
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:34.940 align:start position:0%
no basis for appealing so can we do
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
pre-resolution so that you know we're
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
not tying things up
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
um but I I do think that you know part
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
of how we're
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
all the pre-work that we've done in
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
other words all the voluntary activity
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
that we've been able to get the 32 000
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
people that did their redetermination
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
the 2400 people that have already let us
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
know and they're going to be more who
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
will let us know we don't have to go
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
through a full redetermination with that
 
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
the other thing I'd point out is that
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
the approximately 29 000 individuals who
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
have completed a redetermination that
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
are sort of front loaded because we know
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
they're ineligible they'll have a chance
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
to we'll we'll give them a notice and
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
they'll have a chance to update it but
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
based on what we have for information
 
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
we're not expecting them they don't have
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
to go through a full redetermination
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
process they they go through a process
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
that is will be less and so again having
 
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
done all that work with that group it's
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
not it's not a hundred thousand plus
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we need to do a full
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
redetermination on it's it's a smaller
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
group it's that 73 000. then when you do
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
it at a household level we're back down
 
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
you know 47 000 households which is
 
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
different than 73 000 people because
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a case head and we can
 
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
work it that way
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
um you know I feel like we're as
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
prepared as any state is out there if
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
not more
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
um again I think the the area that I
 
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
feel we have some to strengthen and
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're working on it as we speak to is
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
getting ready for that pre-resolution
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
and and being able to handle appeal
 
00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:14.099 align:start position:0%
volume if it materializes
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
and I think just spreading out the
 
00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:18.430 align:start position:0%
and I think just spreading out the
distribution

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
over this you know 12-month period is
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
going to make a tremendous difference so
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
that is a really uh helpful
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
part of this plan uh that CMS had put
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
together for States because if we had to
 
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
do a little at once I would definitely
 
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
have more concerns but spreading it out
 
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:44.099 align:start position:0%
and strategically determining each month
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
which group we would look at is going to
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
make a tremendous difference for us
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
I know historically having been having
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
worked for the Department there's
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
usually a number of vacant positions in
 
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
every division do you have a number of
 
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
maybe that's maybe that's an unfair
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
question I apologize if it is
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
I've been watching the vacancy rate
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
certainly in light of well regularly but
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
in light of this as well so for
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility staff right now it is at a
 
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
22 percent vacancy rate
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay and that they would determine the
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
eligibility for Medicaid and all that
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
type thing okay thank you
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
in in my area
 
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:34.550 align:start position:0%
in in my area
um

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
I think I'm about 32 vacancy rate but in
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
terms of of this issue probably my my
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
deputy director left to take another
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
position outside of uh government who
 
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
was spearheading this for us um she we
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
have been working very closely with uh
 
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:52.970 align:start position:0%
have been working very closely with uh
and

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
um Deb sorley who's part of uh Karen's
 
00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
team is taking that slice of the pie in
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
terms of standing up and keeping that
 
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:02.579 align:start position:0%
work going and we haven't lost a step
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
with her stepping into supporting us so
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
um we had some redundancy there
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
all right follow up so you said you have
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
a 32 vacancy rate in your in the
 
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
so um if I could just draw your
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
attention to the the bottom
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
um slide below the the percent of
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
population says monthly distribution of
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
individuals estimated if I take you to
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
the far right of the top chart I'm sorry
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
the the numbers are small here
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
um but we'll send it to you
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
electronically so you can increase it on
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
a PDF but if you notice uh like three
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
lines from the bottom a hundred and one
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
thousand seven ninety eight that was the
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
same number you saw earlier on when
 
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
there were the three boxes
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and then the numbers above that the
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
28 996 is again the same number when you
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
looked at individuals and the 72 802
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
which I've been rounding off to 73 000.
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
the same number you saw previously and
 
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
so what we're expecting overall based on
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
experience is that about just under 59
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
000 people who are currently in that
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
protected group will likely not remain
 
00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:23.579 align:start position:0%
eligible and so if you take 60 000
 
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
roughly from where we are in terms of
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
current enrollment that's going to bring
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
us below 200 000 and then we have other
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
individuals who aren't going through
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
their normal distribution then the
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
normal workload of about 11 000
 
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
redeterminations a month we feel like
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
that we're gonna probably within a
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
year's time the 95 000 in granted
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
Advantage is going to look more like
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
sixty four thousand and get as we go
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
through another year we'll get back to I
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
think more where we were pre-pandemic if
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
you will in the 50 000s probably mid to
 
00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:02.099 align:start position:0%
Upper depends on the economy how many
 
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
people you know um poverty levels were
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
just increased by the federal government
 
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
and all these numbers reflect running
 
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
the latest poverty numbers there were
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
about 1700 people who otherwise weren't
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
ineligible that benefited from the new
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
poverty levels that increased about
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
eight percent
 
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.430 align:start position:0%
eight percent
um

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the rest of this is about
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
um what we've been doing
 
00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:28.130 align:start position:0%
um what we've been doing
um

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
to uh again I think when you talked
 
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
about earlier Karen how you know people
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
have bought into what we're doing what
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
we really try to sort of message
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
internally is you know we don't want
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
anybody to lose coverage who shouldn't
 
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
lose coverage right and those that
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be able to remain on we
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
want to find if there is a different
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
source that they can get coverage for
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
example The Exchange we want to make
 
00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:52.339 align:start position:0%
sure that they get connected to that
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
or if they're aging out of the program
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
make sure they get connected to Medicare
 
00:38:58.930 --> 00:38:58.940 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
again showing some
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
some initiative and Leadership I think
 
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
in the country we actually were the
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
first state to approach
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
the cons it's called socio which is an
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
abbreviation for
 
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
the the part of Health and Human
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
Services that oversees the
 
00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
um the operation of the exchanges both
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
from the insurance companies and the and
 
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:26.180 align:start position:0%
looking for Consumer Protection
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
so for example someone who was over
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
income who did nothing with their
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
application just let it die off
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
ordinarily nothing would happen to them
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
they would just they would disappear
 
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
into the ether we worked actually to
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
develop an exchange
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
so someone may ordinarily apply for
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or ordinarily apply for
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
exchange covered correctly if they
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
qualify for one for example exchange
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
um and not Medicaid we send it to uh to
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
the to socio and if in Reverse they'll
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
send someone who may qualify for
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but these people who would
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise if you kind of think of a dead
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
letter box if you will if no one does
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
anything with their application who's
 
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
over income nothing happens and what
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
we've worked on as a process to exchange
 
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
that information back to them so that
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
they can work with the
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
um on a with The Navigators and however
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
they want to do it to make sure that
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're given the opportunity to apply
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
for for coverage and other mechanisms
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
one of the big messaging things that has
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
just come out of the
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
Consolidated appropriation Act is for
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
Medicare individuals and we do have
 
00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:43.619 align:start position:0%
people that are aging out of Medicaid
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
that they have an open enrollment period
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's actually not just associated with
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
the the online but permanently now that
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
if you lose Medicaid in your Medicare
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
level you can have an open enrollment
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
period for six months but what we're
 
00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
going to try to encourage people to do
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
because it's not good for the New
 
00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Insurance Market or for the
 
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
individual don't don't wait for there to
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
be a gap in coverage before you do
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
something people who are on Medicaid
 
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
we'll have an opportunity to apply for
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
exchange coverage in a period that's
 
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:18.260 align:start position:0%
going to be a one-time period between
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
April 1 and July of 24 to apply for
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
exchange coverage again looking at
 
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
it for the benefit of the individual if
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
you get a car accident and you don't
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
have coverage you know you're going to
 
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
be in a hurting Place financially the
 
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
this new open enrollment period allows
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
someone if they know they're going to
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
lose coverage to 60 days in advance to
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
to apply get it all situated so they
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
um we've been working with the insurance
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
department we've been conversing with
 
00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
the large insurers in the state that
 
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
like Anthem and Harvard Community Health
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
Plan about about the population that's
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
going to be coming off that may be their
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
future customers and and making sure
 
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
that they understand what's going on
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
talking to the New Hampshire health plan
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
which does the high-risk stuff to to
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
make sure that this transition not just
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
works for Medicaid but try to work make
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
it work for the insurance department and
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
for individuals and and the private
 
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.990 align:start position:0%

um

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
and trying to be sensitive to the time
 
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
here this
 
00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.609 align:start position:0%
here this
um

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
some other information about like our
 
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.270 align:start position:0%
some other information about like our
noticing

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
noticing
 
00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
um on slide 27 you know we've we've gone
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
we went from what was just we started
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
off with pink letters
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
um to individuals so when we're trying
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
to get them to voluntarily do it sort of
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
a friendly kind of you know it's a good
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
thing to do on your own behalf you know
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
pre-plan and now we've converted to
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
yellow letters messaging and
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
um you know the detail that that we've
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
had to think about is for example
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
there's a national paper shortage and
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know making sure that we've got
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
supplies of paper and making sure simple
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
things like
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
um will our mail machine handle the
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
envelope that we intend to use because
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
we had an example where it didn't so
 
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.630 align:start position:0%
we had an example where it didn't so
just

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
uh Logistics getting all those things
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
and making sure our mail room's situated
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
we have about uh is it close to 60
 
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
percent now of our enrollment have an
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
electronic mechanism so we have an
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
online account so we save Postage and
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
what have you and we're able to
 
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
communicate that way
 
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.210 align:start position:0%
communicate that way
um

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
and uh I guess maybe moving to the
 
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.309 align:start position:0%
and uh I guess maybe moving to the
um

00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:42.650 align:start position:0%
um
this

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:45.609 --> 00:43:45.619 align:start position:0%
slide 32 and 33
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
may be a good place to go here
 
00:43:48.839 --> 00:43:49.430 align:start position:0%
may be a good place to go here
um

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
they'll be certain
 
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.270 align:start position:0%
they'll be certain
um

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
federal reporting requirements that were
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
embedded in the Consolidated
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation act and um slide 32 and 33
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
outline them and kind of our status
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
at the end of January in terms of being
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
able to handle all those things and and
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're we believe that we are but on top
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
of that uh the bottom of 34 going on to
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
to 35 is actually using our
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
technology we've we're going to have a
 
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
much more robust system of being able to
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
reporting on metrics because there's
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of public interest in
 
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
in this and we're going to want to know
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
you know are there certain Geographic
 
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
areas or particular communities where
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
the this enrollment is higher than you
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
would expect it to be so that we can you
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
know take appropriate actions
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
and um let me just stop there I know
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
there's there's other things we want to
 
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
cover with you but uh
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
I think we hit the the highlights that
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
that you as legislators would probably
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
be interested in um and happy if you
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
want us to come back and give reports on
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm this is I'm sure
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
covered somewhere but MSP under Medicaid
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
individuals by eligibility category what
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
does MSP stand for the Medicare
 
00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
secondary plans the people who are like
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
our duels oh okay they have another
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
Insurance in addition to Medicaid you
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
mean yes okay
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
the poor elderly if you representative
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair so what I
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
think I heard you both say is you have
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
all the Manpower that you need to do
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
this program and when it's done in a
 
00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
year you'll have excess capacity
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
sure I don't think you heard us say that
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
exactly I know because I couldn't get
 
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
um disrespectful whatever I mean we just
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
we've done the best planning we can we
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
um you know turnover issues that we can
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
experience of a key person you know
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
we're not necessarily deep in in
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
different areas I think we're I think
 
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go I think the the other
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
thing too is have been Lessons Learned
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
in planning for this that I think we're
 
00:46:17.569 --> 00:46:17.579 align:start position:0%
going to carry carry forward
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
um and also there's only so hard you can
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
push her eligibility team are going to
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
be asked to do almost the 50 increase in
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
their workload
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and you know was that sustainable
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
without pushing people out because they
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
get burnt out I think is another concern
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
that those last three sentences were
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
those that's what I was looking for okay
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you you're you're going to bust
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
your butt for a year working 50 percent
 
00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:47.099 align:start position:0%
extra capacity
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
and and then you're you're worried about
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
burnout during the course of the next
 
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.490 align:start position:0%
burnout during the course of the next
year

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
I want to lose any more people right
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay no this that was the answer I was
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:01.210 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:06.109 align:start position:0%
any other questions
[Music]

00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and at that point you're still gonna
 
00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.950 align:start position:0%
um and at that point you're still gonna
have

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
the rolling ongoing determinations
 
00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:17.339 align:start position:0%
and although you may have more fewer
 
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
people coming off you still have
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
whatever the current volume of
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
applications to come on that you're
 
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
going to have to deal with
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more work that we're doing
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
besides Medicaid for eligibility of all
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
the other eligibility programs that of
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
course there's a concern of what's going
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
to get neglected
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
because of Medicaid unwind if anything's
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
going to get neglected so we can only
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
work with what we have and then trying
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
to be prepared for
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario if you will I mean
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
that's what this has been all about
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
but I I think if I may follow up I think
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and I are both
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
trying to get at the same thing and
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
um I think that thing is if you think
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
you're going to need more people you
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
need to say so really loudly and clearly
 
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
to him because that's where the money
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sorry if I'm putting words in
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
your mouth and that that isn't what you
 
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
meant but that's sort of what I was
 
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.349 align:start position:0%
meant but that's sort of what I was
hearing

00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh year six continues with me
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
learning from you I need to figure out
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
how to just say tell me if you need more
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
money that's really where I was going
 
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
and and and I also assume or I will just
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
say from my perspective
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
although I want you to have the people
 
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
you need if we can find them which is
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
the whole other issue I also don't want
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
to throw money at a problem if it's not
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
going to be useful money thrown usefully
 
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
at a problem but I I also Mr Mr chairman
 
00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
if I would love to hear an update in
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
maybe not a month but maybe three months
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
or at whatever interval the committee
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
deems best because the the thing that I
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
want to keep my eye on as well as
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
whether you have reached the end of your
 
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:14.420 align:start position:0%
elasticity and something's going to snap
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm hearing your concern about
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
the appeals process and I think we want
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
to keep our eye really carefully on that
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what the best reporting
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
schedule is my thought would be three
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
months I've already asked Mr lippman to
 
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
come back every month that we meet even
 
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
if it's a brief report or sometimes a
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
long report and he says this is his
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
favorite group of people and all of them
 
00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
so uh of course he'll come back don't
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
you have to say that
 
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you he doesn't have to he
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
graciously did though okay
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
thank you I would say also too that
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
um you know we've gone out and talked to
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
like the Congressional office the
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
governor's office in terms of the people
 
00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
who might get uh constituent issues and
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
we do want to you know sometimes someone
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of unique circumstances
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
and sometimes we I think we've tried to
 
00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
plan for every contingency of those
 
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
unique circumstances but you know if you
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
hear of constituents that having a
 
00:50:19.609 --> 00:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
problem or something's not working right
 
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
we want to hear about it so you can help
 
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
us in that regard and
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
um appreciate it absolutely
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
is it likely you're going to be coming
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
and talk to us about teeth
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
but what I'm sorry Dental oh
 
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
yeah just just before noon okay
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
may I just add you may
 
00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:49.910 align:start position:0%
may I just add you may
I just

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
I just
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
the question on the Staffing and I I
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
heard that you were trying to ask this
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
question and Karen's being very gracious
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
in her answer but we are 22 aggregate
 
00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:02.339 align:start position:0%
right so in in Karen's and Henry trumps
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
Karen with the 32 to the 22 right our
 
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
nurses trumpet at 64 percent
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
um we're robbing Peter to pay Paul to do
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
this work right so we're paying overtime
 
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
we're doing comp time I'm pulling people
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
that do other tasks have done it in the
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
past to come do that so we have so many
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
open positions so it's not about adding
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
positions necessarily and part of our
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
goal is to try to fill those positions
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
and as we do we burn out the people
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
doing the 50 more right so so I guess
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
the the ask would be in terms of
 
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
understanding the process and the work
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we're doing and that we may we may
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
fall behind we may have complaints but
 
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
we're doing what we can with the
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
resources that we have so I just you
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
know Karen's getting very uh creative
 
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
with how we do that but at the end of
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
the day I do worry that we're going to
 
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
be 32 percent in at the end of this year
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to add that the
 
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
previous Lori told me about a job fair
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
and around and how did that work out
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
we're constantly doing job fairs I mean
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
we just had an item approved to to get
 
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
some additional software tools so
 
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
recruitment is constant Innovation is
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
constant going to schools I mean never
 
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
mind job fairs I mean we're on the
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
street corner I mean we're everywhere we
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
can get to ask people to work come work
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
for us I'm being sarcastic with the
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
street corner my point is we're
 
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.730 align:start position:0%
street corner my point is we're
everywhere

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
um that does explain a sign I saw though
 
00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.530 align:start position:0%
um that does explain a sign I saw though
okay

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
so I was going to talk to you about the
 
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:31.210 align:start position:0%
dress code on the street corner but
 
00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:34.490 align:start position:0%
dress code on the street corner but
[Laughter]

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask how your pay compared
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
with legislative salary but
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know and that's a real I'll be
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
honest with you wages are a real a real
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
Challenge and we're trying through
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
through our department of administrative
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
services to get a new system up that
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
will bring us up to some levels but
 
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that takes a little bit of
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
time and that's time that's gonna that's
 
00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:56.579 align:start position:0%
not gonna impact from a year this is
 
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
happening now so
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
still have time for us I have some we
 
00:53:08.569 --> 00:53:08.579 align:start position:0%
have some time
 
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
okay um have the dental update uh-huh
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
could I just ask one more question
 
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
before you do the dental update sure
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
you know I keep wrestling with this
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
problem of Workforce
 
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
shortages which I I see everywhere I go
 
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
that's no news to anybody in this room
 
00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
some concept and this is for a different
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
committee other than the one I normally
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
sit on
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
but I keep hearing you know you've got a
 
00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:44.339 align:start position:0%
22 percent Gap
 
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
and these are are positions that are
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
currently funded they're just not filled
 
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
and I keep wondering if that couldn't be
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
shifted somehow via the budget or some
 
00:53:58.609 --> 00:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
other mechanism or reclassification or
 
00:54:01.809 --> 00:54:01.819 align:start position:0%
something to
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
fewer funded positions but having those
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
positions funded
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
at a higher level
 
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
using the funding that's already
 
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.770 align:start position:0%
using the funding that's already
allocated

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
and this is clearly a question coming
 
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
from somebody who doesn't work with this
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
all of the time and I just throw it out
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
there if that's if that's something you
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
think about or and I don't desperately
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
need an answer I just wanted to kind of
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
throw it out there because it sounds
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
like if if we could get you by offering
 
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
higher wages for the positions that are
 
00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:39.500 align:start position:0%
open to a 10 percent Gap
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
that might
 
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
take some of the strain off at least
 
00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:47.339 align:start position:0%
that's a great question it's a strategy
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
that we've considered to like even
 
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
temporary enhancements to those
 
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
positions while you're doing
 
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
um the some of this this work for some
 
00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
of the staff
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
um that the reclassification system that
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
Das is working on is is doing that is
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
bringing elevating up eligibility
 
00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
positions they're probably one of the
 
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
lowest paid positions that we have with
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
the most complex work that needs to get
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
done it's not necessarily easy to
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
determine eligibility there's a skill
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
set there so yeah we are we are working
 
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
on that for sure okay great thank you
 
00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.359 --> 00:55:28.130 align:start position:0%
 
much

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
so the next report we have is on the
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
adult Dental benefit and you know we're
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
just a little bit over a month away when
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking to begin we have to get as
 
00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
part of the legislative mandate to to
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
have the The Denture benefit available
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
only to
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
um the waiver population and people in
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
nursing homes as well as the cost
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
sharing we had to do a number of
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
different waivers they're all in motion
 
00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.470 align:start position:0%
different waivers they're all in motion
we've

00:55:59.470 --> 00:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
feel in a good place that we're going to
 
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
get them in place by the end of March so
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
that we can begin April 1st that being
 
00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
said I think our biggest challenge is
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
the sort of the network development and
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
that's our we're focusing on that we've
 
00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
had some good wins there in terms of
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
um in particular oral surgery has been a
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
hard thing to fill and we've been able
 
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:25.220 align:start position:0%
to get a good group of oral surgeons
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
in so far and uh
 
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.170 align:start position:0%
in so far and uh
um

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Northeast Delta Dental and
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
DentaQuest their subcontractor
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
um are are working on other strategies
 
00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
to try to you know fill in I think
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
certainly by April 1st
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
um you know the health conditions that
 
00:56:49.849 --> 00:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
um you know require immediacy will be
 
00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:53.099 align:start position:0%
able to be handled and will be I think
 
00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
ramping up the the preventative uh
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
aspect of it
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
um but I think we'll be in a in a a
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
place where we have enough that we'll be
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
given the green light from CMS to to
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
continue that and I I promise to keep
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
you informed if it's different than that
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
um you know we are again on the edge in
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
terms of we didn't have a long time to
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
stand this up but we think we're going
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
to get there and that's what I think
 
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
it's reflected here on the report
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
are there Geographic gaps in the people
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
who are coming forward to be providers
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
there there are some Geographic things
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to work on
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I have one of my staff leads is is
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
sort of running this so I'm not as
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
informed exactly what they are but in
 
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
terms of just general updates I know
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
that those are things we're trying to
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
fill out and that's where I think
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
Northeast Delta Dental and that the
 
00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
quest of coming up with potentially some
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
other things to offer dentists to
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
encourage them to to sign on
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
would you expand on that I I know I've
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
had this conversation with you a few
 
00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
times and also with Tom Raphael of Delta
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
Dental in terms of incentivizing
 
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:05.870 align:start position:0%
Dental in terms of incentivizing
um

00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
what are you doing that seems to be
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
getting results
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
I think up to this point it's been sort
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
of appeared appeared it's you know we've
 
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's been something that the state and
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
people have had an interest in adult
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
Dental to stand up and there's been a
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
lot of push there and the second thing
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
is I think that
 
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:27.770 align:start position:0%
is I think that
um

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
people under getting people to
 
00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
understand who are in the dental
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
profession the extra wraparounds that
 
00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:35.339 align:start position:0%
you know the worst thing a dentist has
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
is an empty chair you know that you know
 
00:58:41.089 --> 00:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
what what type of supports are there and
 
00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
I think the probably the last level is
 
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
is there some economic things that uh
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
Delta Dental and dentaquist can offer to
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
to uh to encourage some other folks to
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
to sign up and that that's kind of
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
they're working through those thoughts
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
at the moment some Financial
 
00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.510 align:start position:0%
at the moment some Financial
incentivization

00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
incentivization
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
yep some you know the the fee schedules
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
an enhanced fee schedule but you know um
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know other other things to get them
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
to do the enrollment part of it do you
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
have anything I speak as one who is
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
desperately short of pcps in our family
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
practice uh
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
just can't find them and so we're now
 
00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.030 align:start position:0%
just can't find them and so we're now
um

00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
going to a med school and saying we'll
 
00:59:27.289 --> 00:59:27.299 align:start position:0%
help you with your tuition but you owe
 
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
us and doing that sort of thing is that
 
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
under consideration for uh people in
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
dental school so we do have the loan
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
repayment program already in place we
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
also Dr Finney can speak more to this
 
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
we've in terms of connecting with the
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
dental schools I think there was an
 
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
article I read this past week that talks
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
about this a hundred thousand shortage
 
00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:53.099 align:start position:0%
of dentists around the country so I mean
 
00:59:56.569 --> 00:59:56.579 align:start position:0%
we're it it is a difficult situation the
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
other thing is what can be done in terms
 
00:59:58.740 --> 00:59:59.710 align:start position:0%
other thing is what can be done in terms
of

00:59:59.710 --> 00:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
tele-dentistry for for screenings and
 
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
what can be done in terms of using
 
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
extenders if you will in terms of trying
 
01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:08.339 align:start position:0%
to get to the preventative things I
 
01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:09.740 align:start position:0%
think those are all
 
01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:12.059 align:start position:0%
strategies that that are being looked at
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
is there a dental equivalent of a nurse
 
01:00:14.579 --> 01:00:16.789 align:start position:0%
is there a dental equivalent of a nurse
practitioner

01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:18.049 align:start position:0%
practitioner
um

01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
I think that's a little bit outside my
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
say equivalent but there are individuals
 
01:00:26.049 --> 01:00:26.059 align:start position:0%
who can do some of a preventative work
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
that does require ultimately I think a
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
dentist to come by and and
 
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
professionally to to supervise what was
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
was done but you can extend the dentist
 
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
that'd be a good thing to work on
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps for future legislation because
 
01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
we have been authorizing various steps
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
between here and here over the years and
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
this might be a hopeful thing yeah there
 
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
are some professions that are trying to
 
01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:51.770 align:start position:0%
are some professions that are trying to
advocate

01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
that would require professional
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
licensure changes in our state to to be
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
able to accommodate okay and the other
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Weber I'll
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
start with a comment I know the
 
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
independent practice of dental
 
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
hygienists is something that's been an
 
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
issue ongoing and I'm not sure the
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
status right now because it's been a
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
while since I was on knee DNA but that
 
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
has been this under discussion for at
 
01:01:19.329 --> 01:01:19.339 align:start position:0%
least the last 10 years or so
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
but if I made the question I wanted to
 
01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
ask is I have heard some feedback and it
 
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
wasn't direct to me so I don't know
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise I would have had people come
 
01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
direct to
 
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
you uh but in the context of
 
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
um eye care
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
I know that there was somebody who
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
expressed real concern about how long it
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
took to be reimbursed like six months
 
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
for Eye Care and
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
if if you're the only if if you're the
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
only practitioner that does it and
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
you're also having to wait that long to
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed
 
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh and maybe outside of the scope of
 
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here today to talk
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
about those gaps but I'm hoping that
 
01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:12.890 align:start position:0%
about those gaps but I'm hoping that
there

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
that you're building mechanisms in place
 
01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
so that the people who do actually sign
 
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.690 align:start position:0%
so that the people who do actually sign
up

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
get paid in a timely manner because
 
01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
otherwise they won't resign and then
 
01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
you'll be in a bigger pickle so so we do
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
have a contractual time frames in which
 
01:02:35.049 --> 01:02:35.059 align:start position:0%
they have to pay claims and
 
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
I know one of members of the committee
 
01:02:39.549 --> 01:02:39.559 align:start position:0%
referred to me
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
a practice that I need to we missed each
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
other because they went on vacation
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
right after but I do need to finish
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
following up with them but you know
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
people shouldn't encourage you if you
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
hear anybody that's not getting paid
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
within 30 days want to hear about it
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
okay so so 30 days is the basic
 
01:02:58.270 --> 01:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
expectation yes
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
a clean claim meaning that it's got all
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
the information
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
right representative Edwards uh thank
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh we uh at the kickoff of
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
this term I was in on a presentation by
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
a UNH demographer who
 
01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
um had all kinds of great statistics
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
about the layout of uh the demographics
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
in our state and one of the areas of
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
special interest to me were those
 
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
Pockets where we had
 
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
um a a disproportionate percentage of of
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh poverty I'll just go with poverty and
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
often that poverty was also associated
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
with the race or ethnicity but but in a
 
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
in a map of New Hampshire there were
 
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:49.670 align:start position:0%
in a map of New Hampshire there were
like

01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
four or five you know discernible
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
pockets and I'm just wondering uh as I
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
hear you talk about the gaps in the
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
provider network if there's any
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
intentional mapping of where our gaps
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
are to where we have potential Health
 
01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
inequalities to ensure that we're doing
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
what we can specifically to to make sure
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
that our Health Care system is balanced
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
and evenly distributed do you get what
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
I'm saying there I believe I do and
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
there actually are what they
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
you know the Health Resource Services
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
Administration Again part of the federal
 
01:04:36.049 --> 01:04:36.059 align:start position:0%
has actually mapped out what they called
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
um professional shortage areas dentist
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
is one Mental Health Providers or
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
Another Part of of dealing with some of
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
the the if you if you kind of look at I
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a map
 
01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
um I think in the slide deck that I'll
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
review with the at your committee on
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
Monday but just showing kind of where
 
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
the different enrollment is in that
 
01:04:59.930 --> 01:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
unfortunately like where the population
 
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.130 align:start position:0%
unfortunately like where the population
is

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
is smaller it tends to be more of those
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
challenges which makes it difficult for
 
01:05:09.289 --> 01:05:09.299 align:start position:0%
practice to have the size and the
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
turnover to be you know successful and
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's you kind of think about
 
01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.490 align:start position:0%
it's you kind of think about
um

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:15.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
managing your mix of who you're going to
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
serve in other words you know it's very
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
hard for a practice that's relying
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
totally on Medicaid to survive and a
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
practice that has a higher commercial
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
balance of patients you know that's
 
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
people tend to locate where they're
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to get attract a customer base if
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
you will or patient base where they can
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
balance it out where they can
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh make up make a living if you will and
 
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
serving and I'm you know it looks like
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
you want to say something about that
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
chairman oh yeah
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
seeing the report come across my desk
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
every week I know roughly how many
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
Medicaid people we can take even though
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
we are a faith-based non-profit and this
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
is part of our mission statement that
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
piece of paper does not give adequate
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
payment to my staff so I know how much
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
we can do and we are willing to do more
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
if our reimbursement rate was realistic
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
so I said that to just about everybody
 
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
including a lot of people who don't care
 
01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay so I think what I'm asking if I had
 
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
an ask is as you're looking at the the
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
the Gap in your network if you find a
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
correlation between the Gap and the
 
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
network and these pockets of a
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
particular in inequality would you
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
please make it a special effort to
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
report to the to the this committee
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
with your permission so that we are
 
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
aware if we've if we've got a gap in
 
01:06:59.650 --> 01:06:59.660 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do to proactively
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
manage the Gap away
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
in in those particular areas where we
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
have a disproportionate poverty
 
01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:18.299 align:start position:0%
thank you I have um another piece in
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
terms of a couple of pieces that uh
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
all right Mr Edwards would be happy to
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
pass Mr Williams would be happy to pass
 
01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
he's even buttoning his suit jacket
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
which is what you do when you approach
 
01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
never

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
so I just
 
01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.890 align:start position:0%
so I just
um

01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
wanted to share some
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's coming around is this color chart
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about in a minute there's uh
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
some uh statistics that the Kaiser
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
Family Foundation puts together about
 
01:08:15.729 --> 01:08:15.739 align:start position:0%
every state and the US on on Medicaid
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
this report was dated October 22nd
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
um of 22 excuse me October of 2022
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just I want to hit on a
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
couple points here there's also the
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
United States average
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
one thing I would share with you
 
01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:35.689 align:start position:0%
one thing I would share with you
um

01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
and I'll there's also a link here that
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a state has the fourth
 
01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
lowest Medicaid enrollment in the
 
01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:45.410 align:start position:0%
lowest Medicaid enrollment in the
country

01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
um so while it feels like you know and
 
01:08:50.809 --> 01:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
it is true that we have had a
 
01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
significant increase in in enrollment
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
um where the fourth lowest out of 50
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
states in Medicaid enrollment
 
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
um sort of the the
 
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
the percent of population that's low
 
01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
income and the percent of population at
 
01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:07.699 align:start position:0%
the top of the the chart there
 
01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
that are covered by Medicaid today in
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
the country it's almost one in three
 
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
people are covered by Medicaid based on
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
the continuous coverage in New Hampshire
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
it's about one in five and a half
 
01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.910 align:start position:0%
it's about one in five and a half
individuals

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.749 align:start position:0%
individuals
um

01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
the other interesting statistic I think
 
01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:24.500 align:start position:0%
you might find
 
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
on the bottom right is and I mentioned
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
this when I was at a senate hearing this
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
week is that 70 of the people on
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in New Hampshire are working
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
um that's higher than the national
 
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
average and compared to New Hampshire in
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
2019 I think we're at 65 percent in 2019
 
01:09:46.199 --> 01:09:47.450 align:start position:0%
2019 I think we're at 65 percent in 2019
um

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then you know just I won't go over
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
everything here but it just if you want
 
01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
to compare how many
 
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
um you know adults we cover along the
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
bottom left there there's the number of
 
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
adults that we we cover is one in ten
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
you can compare that to the U.S
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and you know children nursing home
 
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.189 align:start position:0%
um and you know children nursing home
residents

01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
residents
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
Medicare beneficiaries and probably most
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
of the categories
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire is probably a little
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
bit less than the national
 
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:14.689 align:start position:0%
bit less than the national
um

01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
um it kind of is I think a the top chart
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
left-hand chart shows enrollment versus
 
01:10:30.169 --> 01:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
expenditures and as you would expect you
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
know there are certain populations that
 
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
we enroll that
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the older people the people
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
who are on waivers we spend more money
 
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
proportionally per enrollee it's not
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily a surprise but it's just I
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
think a nice graph that shows it
 
01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.290 align:start position:0%
think a nice graph that shows it
um

01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
if you look at uh sort of two-thirds
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
down on the left hand side you know 24
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
of the births in New Hampshire are
 
01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid you know but there's
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know where we've seen some stresses
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
where that can be 50 in some parts of
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
the state or more and so that you know
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
when you talk about kind of where things
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
are located and and stressor is what
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen you know and and the
 
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
legislature did some intervention in
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
terms of approving more money for
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
maintaining maternity care in hospitals
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
and birthing centers
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
um can I ask you in terms of this sure
 
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
pie chart 24 of births
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
I with four grandchildren one was quick
 
01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
the other was slow but still it took
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
place over a very brief period of time
 
01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:36.860 align:start position:0%
does this mean they were covered
 
01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.530 align:start position:0%
does this mean they were covered
pre-birth

01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:38.540 align:start position:0%
pre-birth
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
postpartum how long or just the day they
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
were born which I don't believe but yeah
 
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
now I don't know that this chart does
 
01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
that level of degradation if you will in
 
01:11:53.169 --> 01:11:53.179 align:start position:0%
terms of when that coverage kicked in
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
one thing I would say about New
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is if you look at compared to
 
01:11:59.450 --> 01:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
the National numbers we have more
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
generous eligibility criteria for
 
01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:05.420 align:start position:0%
children and so you know in terms of uh
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
you know taking care of kids in terms of
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
providing coverage I think you know we
 
01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
stand out in terms of having
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
better eligibility levels than some
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
and we're working hard on those
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
postpartum periods
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
I think I have uh so the the other Pages
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
if you want to just compare to to the
 
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
United States and
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
um if you're interested in any other
 
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
state it's easy to send you a link and
 
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
you can do a comparison
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
um the next grouping what are two maps
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
one is the postpartum coverage map I
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
know that the house took up uh
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage
 
01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:53.570 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage
um

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:53.580 --> 01:13:03.649 align:start position:0%
um
Annapolis

01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:10.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
there's one more handout yeah you have
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
taught me the law
 
01:13:20.219 --> 01:13:22.930 align:start position:0%
taught me the law
okay

01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:22.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
sorry pull a lot of order here
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
chair this is this is just an editorial
 
01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.030 align:start position:0%
chair this is this is just an editorial
comment

01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
um I I realized that the Kaiser Family
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
Foundation is a separate entity and one
 
01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:07.460 align:start position:0%
of the things I do is they track
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
politics but for a handout from the
 
01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
government this in the on the second
 
01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
page bottom left corner yes associating
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
political viewpoints with support for
 
01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:22.940 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I this this is probably
 
01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for a government policy
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
perspective but
 
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's my point of view I know you
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
didn't produce it I just I'm just
 
01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
warning you that this probably isn't
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
something that ought to be on materials
 
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.550 align:start position:0%
something that ought to be on materials
okay

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:50.030 align:start position:0%
okay
foreign

01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
the two maps one is sort of as of
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
February 10th uh kind of what's going on
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
in the country in terms of uh States on
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
that matter and then
 
01:15:03.649 --> 01:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
um on the
 
01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
the second map is the the Medicaid
 
01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:08.450 align:start position:0%
the second map is the the Medicaid
expansion

01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
um there are now 39 States plus uh uh DC
 
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
that are have adopted the latest state
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
is South Dakota which is in the
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
implementation phase and this this is
 
01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.370 align:start position:0%
implementation phase and this this is
just

01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:15:23.689 --> 01:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
because I know you're looking at these
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
issues I thought you might like to have
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
these two two things
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
um but I I sort of uh
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
sort of a punchline document here just
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
some observations that I would make at
 
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
one at which I began my conversation
 
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
with saying that you know only New
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the fourth lowest
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I gave you the link if you want to
 
01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:48.860 align:start position:0%
check that out and
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
look at that the
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I think is
 
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
impressive and if you think of Medicaid
 
01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
not just as a loan but how it works with
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
the rest of the insurance markets that
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire ranked number one in
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
the country in terms of employer covered
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
insurance which again I think is is a
 
01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
good thing in terms of
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
employer-sponsored coverage
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
um in part I think when you look at the
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program in terms of how
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
what risks it manages and what the what
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
the exchange manages I think that's
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
helps the health of our market and then
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
um we covered that point in terms of the
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
percent of people
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
um working but number four
 
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
um this sort of my own personal
 
01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
observation of excuse me is this a new
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:01.070 align:start position:0%
 
apartment

01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.410 align:start position:0%
 
control

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.030 align:start position:0%
control
so

01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
the perspective I would say is you're
 
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
thinking about it from a policy
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
perspective Medicaid's part of the the
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
I think the functioning of the insurance
 
01:17:16.729 --> 01:17:16.739 align:start position:0%
markets but when you look at the 1332
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
waiver that the insurance department
 
01:17:23.209 --> 01:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
obtained to help manage risk and you
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
look at moving Medicaid expansion out of
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
the exchange and back into the Managed
 
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
Care Program
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
that the health of New Hampshire's
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
Insurance Market
 
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
you know the Benchmark premium on the
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
exchange was the lowest in the country
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
we used to be higher but I think the
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
combination of policy levers that have
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
been pulled in the state
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
um have put us in a pretty good position
 
01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:50.870 align:start position:0%
um have put us in a pretty good position
um

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
and that you know in addition we're
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
seeing a higher percentage of the
 
01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program working so if if you
 
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
look at things that you'd like to have
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
come out of all these different policy
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
levers I think you can be proud of
 
01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:08.780 align:start position:0%
legislatively what and you know from a
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
Department's perspective both insurance
 
01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:14.300 align:start position:0%
and and and others
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
that that we're healthcare is expensive
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to say it's not but I
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
think in terms of relative to other
 
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
states positions we have something to be
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
proud about here we more people working
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
than average you know lower Benchmark
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
premium and a higher in the highest
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
actually employer sponsored coverage in
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
the country so
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
could we infer that because there is
 
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
Health Care to some degree available to
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
more people
 
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
those people are going to be healthier
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
and more likely to have and keep a job
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
yes I think that is an inference I would
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
I would take from this okay
 
01:19:00.649 --> 01:19:00.659 align:start position:0%
representative Weber one quick question
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
is you were talking about managing
 
01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
the costs with respect to levers you
 
01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.470 align:start position:0%
the costs with respect to levers you
said

01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
the one thing I want to be sure of if
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
we're looking at these numbers and
 
01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
we're looking at these numbers and
they're

01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:18.860 align:start position:0%
real reasons to be self-congratulatory
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
are we comparing Apples to Apples in
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
that we are comparing the same level of
 
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
benefits across the states because we
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
know that you know there are a lot of
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
programs that some states adopt some
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
states don't adopt so I'm just wondering
 
01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:37.460 align:start position:0%
if if that
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
discrepancy or not discrepancy if that
 
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
variation has been factored into the
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
numbers here
 
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
in terms of The Benchmark premium yes on
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
that okay that is that is um
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
that is a national
 
01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:56.219 align:start position:0%
standard in terms of what you offer on
 
01:19:58.450 --> 01:19:58.460 align:start position:0%
Exchange is there's a 10 essential
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
benefits and it's it's a specific so
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
this is the basic package the basic
 
01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:05.030 align:start position:0%
this is the basic package the basic
package

01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
package
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
I guess the most common purchase one is
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
what they use okay because I just if if
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is saving money because
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
we're not providing the same services or
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
if we're not providing adequate Services
 
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
that's not a reason to congratulate
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves but if we're comparing to the
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
same bundle of basic Services then
 
01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
but I think it looks really good
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
Medicaid when you've seen one state
 
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
you've seen one state there are
 
01:20:33.649 --> 01:20:33.659 align:start position:0%
commonalities but you know I think again
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're seeing you know
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
comparing 2019 to 2022 and we're seeing
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
more people working
 
01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good thing I can't say
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's because of this or that but it just
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
is and you know it's it's uh the the
 
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
numbers that are behind that Workforce
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
numbers are not numbers produced by
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
Kaiser their numbers produces through
 
01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
the federal government Bureau of Labor
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
Statistics and one other Bureau that
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
and part of the census I think that
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
the only other thing that I had if you
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
still have time for me was the chairman
 
01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
asked me to and
 
01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:16.790 align:start position:0%
asked me to and
um

01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
to look at rate setting a little bit and
 
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:20.930 align:start position:0%
to look at rate setting a little bit and
I

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
um also know that the chairman
 
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.669 align:start position:0%
um also know that the chairman
um

01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
division three wants me to do some too
 
01:21:30.490 --> 01:21:30.500 align:start position:0%
and I have something here today that
 
01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work to to developing
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
this but I think the concept was you
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
know looking at targeted rate setting
 
01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
versus across the board and I have some
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
material here to
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
that won't answer all the questions it's
 
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
a beginning of I think the process
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
um but uh let me just walk through some
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question
 
01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
while the document's being passed out so
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Lipman do you want to introduce us as
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
as the 80 20 first cut or disclaim what
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're about to look at
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
I would say that
 
01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
um the 80 20 is in part you'll see me
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
raise that a bit but it's not I guess a
 
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
full 80 20 maybe as as you fully maybe
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
envisioned but it begins to get to that
 
01:22:30.649 --> 01:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
um it's just in terms of
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of data work that needs
 
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
to be done and I've done as much as I
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
could get out of the various resources I
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
have to to to do that and I just I could
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
what I want to do is today is present
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
um sort of some Concepts
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
um and and share some data
 
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
so the fir if uh slide one
 
01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
um is sort of uh
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
I guess my overview of what you would
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
expect to see and rate setting in terms
 
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
of just rates in general that you know
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
generally Medicaid rates
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
um where it's possible usually expressed
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of Medicare Medicare
 
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
being a system that's intended for
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
reasonably efficient provider to cover
 
01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
full costs Medicaid generally covers a
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
percentage of full costs
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
um all when it doesn't cover variable
 
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
cost and only covers a little bit of
 
01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
full cost is when as the chairman talks
 
01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
about it you have to manage how many
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
patients you accept or accept at all
 
01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:37.669 align:start position:0%
patients you accept or accept at all
um

01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
and then commercial rates are typically
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
for facilities or two times Medicare for
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
Physician Services about one and a half
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
times that though that relationship of
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
one and a half times doesn't necessarily
 
01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
follow through when you get like at
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy ambulances and other
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
things in our state
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
um you know the within the Medicaid
 
01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.470 align:start position:0%
um you know the within the Medicaid
Program

01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
Program
 
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
um to cover all the drugs and everything
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we we have on our charge Master if
 
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
you will there's 13 000 codes but using
 
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
the 80 20 Rule and
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
um and if you jump to
 
01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.390 align:start position:0%
um and if you jump to
um

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
um let's see the last uh
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
let's see yeah
 
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:31.370 align:start position:0%
let's see yeah
actually

01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
for those of us who are ignorant could
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
you just explain what the 80 20 rule is
 
01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.250 align:start position:0%
you just explain what the 80 20 rule is
sure

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
um the Pareto Principle
 
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
um is basically that typically uh 20 of
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
something can describe 80 of what you're
 
01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
you're going at and so you know
 
01:24:50.209 --> 01:24:50.219 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
um of the 13 000 codes as an example and
 
01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.250 align:start position:0%
um of the 13 000 codes as an example and
um

01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
about 100 codes explained about 80 of
 
01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:05.900 align:start position:0%
our spending
 
01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:10.460 align:start position:0%
or in waiver Services maybe 142 codes
 
01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
billing codes uh you know represent
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
about 80 percent of our spending thank
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
you um and
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think we have time to
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
go through sort of a code level but um
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
do you know that my dog giving Comfort
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
to scared people in the waiting room is
 
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
not a billing code because we looked I I
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
believe you and other other things
 
01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.830 align:start position:0%
believe you and other other things
um

01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:47.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:47.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like how when you're doing
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
targeted rate setting how you might go
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
about looking at it
 
01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
um so you know if I sort of put it in
 
01:25:59.090 --> 01:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
steps here is that I think the first
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
thing you look at is how does the rate
 
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
that you're paying compared to Medicare
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
or if it's a cost reimburse Services how
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
does it compare to allowable Medicaid
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
costs that's I think the first thing but
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's not the only thing you have to
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
look at again I think we also tend to
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
look at other states rates to see what
 
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
they're they're paying but that
 
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
sometimes doesn't tell the whole story
 
01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:25.450 align:start position:0%
sometimes doesn't tell the whole story
either

01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:25.460 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
then where it starts to come into a less
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
more subjective because we don't have
 
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
hard data on this up
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
um is you know are we seeing access
 
01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.470 align:start position:0%
um is you know are we seeing access
issues

01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
um you know in for example in private
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
duty nursing we're only able to fulfill
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
60 of of the um uh the hours that are
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
assessed by a physician as an example
 
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:50.219 align:start position:0%
um you know based on the Staffing that's
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
available you know we have we've all
 
01:26:54.649 --> 01:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
read a lot about the Mental Health
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
crisis in terms of how long it takes to
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
to uh to get an appointment if it's not
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
a crisis situation
 
01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:01.970 align:start position:0%
a crisis situation
um

01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
then you know a fourth factor is you
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
know the the number of Medicaid patients
 
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
or the percentage of your revenue or
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
percentage of your patient base that you
 
01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:13.739 align:start position:0%
can afford to serve
 
01:27:13.739 --> 01:27:14.450 align:start position:0%
can afford to serve
um

01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:15.649 align:start position:0%
um
then

01:27:15.649 --> 01:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the financial status of the
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
provider type you know
 
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
um some some providers have a little bit
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
more that they're less dependent on
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or maybe larger and get certain
 
01:27:29.570 --> 01:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
economies than others I'd you know
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
describe for example I think
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
some provider types are are like the
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
subsistent farmers you know they're just
 
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
barely making it there's no real
 
01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
reserves there and then I think the
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
other factor that we've talked about
 
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
today is
 
01:27:45.729 --> 01:27:45.739 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
is there the workforce shortage issues
 
01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:50.219 align:start position:0%
are um and so I think you have to look
 
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
at these issues together
 
01:27:54.649 --> 01:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
um sort of
 
01:27:54.659 --> 01:27:56.390 align:start position:0%
um sort of
um

01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
a holistic approach of what you're
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I'm looking at
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
step four and I'm I'm just trying to
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
think through the rationale of of why
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's uh a concern of Medicaid to look at
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
a percentage of revenue from both the
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and an uncompensated care
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
perspective is it is it Our obligation
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
is the state's obligation to worry about
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
managing the uncompensated care levels
 
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
at a given facility
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
it serves exclusively or near
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
exclusively Medicaid and they have a lot
 
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
of uncompensated care their ability to
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
stay around because they're not getting
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
full cost on anything and if we're
 
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
depending on that provider type is the
 
01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.370 align:start position:0%
depending on that provider type is the
issue

01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
is is to what extent is the amount of
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care a local provider
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
decision is are they mandated to provide
 
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of the Care under
 
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
their uncompensated care
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
program or or I I'm just trying I it's
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
been so long I looked at uncompensated
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
care I'm just trying to re-remember
 
01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
the flexibility the providers have in
 
01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
accepting that
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
so so some of it may be just better
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
described as bad debt like the you know
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
person has a high deductible plan and
 
01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
you know they have you know they owe a
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars or a thousand dollars or
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars on a bill and you
 
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
know do they make that that payment and
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
um so I think that it's a again
 
01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.270 align:start position:0%
um so I think that it's a again
um

01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.270 align:start position:0%
um
in

01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
our nursing home reimbursement and our
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hospital reimbursement in the state we
 
01:29:54.729 --> 01:29:54.739 align:start position:0%
do take into account directly
 
01:29:58.370 --> 01:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
on uncovered costs and so I think we do
 
01:30:00.649 --> 01:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
have an interest but ultimately the
 
01:30:04.129 --> 01:30:04.139 align:start position:0%
interest boils down to can the people
 
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
you know are we providing a compliant
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
program where people have access to the
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
benefit that we're paying a premium for
 
01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
through the insurer but that that I
 
01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
think is
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
um you know like
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder provider one
 
01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
provider for example might accept all
 
01:30:24.649 --> 01:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
comers and if that provider is going to
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
go down the drain and we're going to
 
01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
lose complete access to say high level
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder Services we do
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
have to take an interest in that to
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that the person can people can
 
01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
continue to be served it's not as I say
 
01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's not like a mathematical calculation
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a factor in in looking at
 
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
the the rate that when you're targeting
 
01:30:51.290 --> 01:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
rates what you should potentially do
 
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
I know in my facility we look at bad
 
01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:55.550 align:start position:0%
I know in my facility we look at bad
debt

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
debt
 
01:30:57.169 --> 01:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
and we try to look at it as
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
compassionately as we can
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
and there's very good reasons why very
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
good people sometimes can't pay their
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
bills and we very often will carry those
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
people to the degree we have good
 
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
insurance people paying
 
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
we also have the right to discharge a
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
patient in 30 days you can come to us
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
for the next 30 days but after that 30
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
days you're out you are not our patient
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
and we've had to do that rarely
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
other people other facilities may have a
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
different standard of when they boot
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
people for bad debt
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
the third page in is
 
01:31:41.159 --> 01:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
the third page in is
um

01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
again in terms of the time frame I had
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
to sort of work on things working with
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
some existing data is looking at some
 
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
major groupings of of codes in terms of
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
what percent of Medicare
 
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
um based this is not managed care data
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
this is just what we're paying under
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
FIFA service what percent of Medicare
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
are we are we paying so generally you
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
would hope to see
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
something and in a let's say a
 
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
diversified provider you know
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
I think it's between 60 and 80 percent
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
would be considered that you're covering
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
variable costs and and some of fixed
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
costs in some areas you'll see we we pay
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
more than that and there's reasons to do
 
01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:28.139 align:start position:0%
so but it's it's starting to look at
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
what categories where we may need to to
 
01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
look at certain things and the bottom
 
01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
one I'll explain in a moment but this is
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
kind of where we are today in terms of
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
looking at our FIFA service schedule
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
against the Medicare fee schedule you
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
can see in a lot of areas you know below
 
01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
60 percent
 
01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.470 align:start position:0%
60 percent
um

01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
and the bottom one is really again a
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's a very small area and it's it's the
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
where the that number is high is related
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
to supplies
 
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
not on ambulance services I'll show you
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
ambulance in a little bit
 
01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.270 align:start position:0%
ambulance in a little bit
um

01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
but again this is only a very small
 
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
number and we're only talking FIFA
 
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
service here and in part sometimes
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
because you know they've been years in
 
01:33:19.850 --> 01:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
some cases decades between being able to
 
01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
adjust fee schedules that some things
 
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
get out of out of whack and being able
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
to do a targeted approach allows us to
 
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
um going to the fourth slide
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
there are some Services we pay on a cost
 
01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
basis and
 
01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:40.729 align:start position:0%
basis and
um

01:33:40.729 --> 01:33:40.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
and these uh the numbers that we're
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
looking at here are don't include any
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
supplemental payments or or additional
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
payments made outside of the the
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
payments here but basically this is
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
a group of facilities that are based on
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
a cost basis you might house members in
 
01:34:01.729 --> 01:34:01.739 align:start position:0%
particular might zero in on nursing
 
01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:03.980 align:start position:0%
facilities County providers
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
that we make two additional payments on
 
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
top of the what is 48 of cost is what
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
the what the daily rate reimbursement
 
01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
amounts to but we also make uh based on
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
the the provider tax that nfq excuse the
 
01:34:20.410 --> 01:34:20.420 align:start position:0%
nfqa tax
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's assessed we make a payment and
 
01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
then we also make the pro share payment
 
01:34:27.010 --> 01:34:27.020 align:start position:0%
on top of that
 
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
again when you look at
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
um you know the county providers are
 
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
serving almost you know approaching 80
 
01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:35.270 align:start position:0%
serving almost you know approaching 80
percent

01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
um private providers 61 percent the
 
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:40.860 align:start position:0%
private providers do not get a uh
 
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
just excuse me a pro share payment
 
01:34:47.689 --> 01:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
and then state-owned facilities
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
um where we're trying to get it up to
 
01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
cost is basically what the what you see
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
there there are some costs that aren't
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed
 
01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.330 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed
um

01:34:59.330 --> 01:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
the the next slide is just an example of
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
something that I'm sorry yes
 
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to this is an area that
 
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
I just am not at all familiar with so
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I hope you'll pardon my ignorance but
 
01:35:16.729 --> 01:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
I I'm looking at the fact that the
 
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
county providers are
 
01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:20.330 align:start position:0%
county providers are
um

01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:22.370 align:start position:0%
um
at

01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
a base
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
base rate of forty percent eight percent
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
of allowable cost
 
01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.229 align:start position:0%
of allowable cost
um

01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:30.239 --> 01:35:32.030 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why there's so much
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
difference between that and the private
 
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
facilities and what that all means
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
because I'm really ignorant in this area
 
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
and if if it's just me I'll I'll back
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
off and have that conversation outside
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
of everybody else's time but
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
um we're all pretty concerned about our
 
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes
 
01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:53.330 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes
um

01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
County facilities right I think we would
 
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
recognize Often by The Last Resort in
 
01:36:02.290 --> 01:36:02.300 align:start position:0%
terms of accepting a patient so
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
in many instances the the mix of people
 
01:36:09.490 --> 01:36:09.500 align:start position:0%
that they have to accept or do accept
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
may have a
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
higher intensity of need of service it
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
could be not necessarily that they're
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
sicker but they may need more supports
 
01:36:19.679 --> 01:36:21.950 align:start position:0%
sicker but they may need more supports
yep

01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
right so then the what what the 48
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
represents is the daily rate so if
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
you're if you're accepting patients that
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
are more costly to serve if you will the
 
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
cost that the county facilities have
 
01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:40.330 align:start position:0%
cost that the county facilities have
um

01:36:40.330 --> 01:36:40.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
you would expect that
 
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
um they would cost more
 
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
um and that the rate would be less
 
01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:48.530 align:start position:0%
um and that the rate would be less
sufficient

01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
um so then what we do for all nursing
 
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
facilities we try to make up some of the
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
difference between costs through the the
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
tax program and the the extra match that
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
we draw and pay out to all facilities
 
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
and then for the counties because they
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
have that sort of adverse situation we
 
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
make the pro share payment on top of
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
that so I don't have didn't have time to
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
to calculate what that all would look
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
like but that's just a
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
show you why in one instance we if we
 
01:37:21.770 --> 01:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
didn't take into account
 
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
the pair mix of the counties and do
 
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
something extra we wouldn't have
 
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
probably County nursing facilities no I
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
understand I understand the mix I just
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
didn't understand how this statistic
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
related to it so thank you
 
01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:36.709 align:start position:0%
related to it so thank you
um

01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
the next example is um
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
related to private duty nursing and
 
01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.189 align:start position:0%
related to private duty nursing and
um

01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
licensed practical nurses in the state
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
plan in terms of we had some concerns
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
expressed to us about you know and as I
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned to you we have uh trouble
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
meeting all the hours that patients have
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
been assessed for and you know we did
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
some comparisons with other states here
 
01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.770 align:start position:0%
some comparisons with other states here
and

01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:07.550 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh this is probably something that we
 
01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:15.179 align:start position:0%
did probably about a year ago and and
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
when you look at the sum total of it
 
01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
when we compare ourselves to like
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Maine and
 
01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:22.370 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Maine and
um

01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:24.410 --> 01:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
um Rhode Island
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're pretty
 
01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
competitive there but we're also hearing
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
from that that provide a class that
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
they're stressed stressed in providing
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
services and
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
um you know we see a big gap in coverage
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
um again
 
01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:39.649 align:start position:0%
um again
um

01:38:39.649 --> 01:38:39.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a judgment call in terms
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
of targeting rate increases you know
 
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
because if you're not providing adequate
 
01:38:48.110 --> 01:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
Home Care people end up
 
01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:49.860 align:start position:0%
institutionalized which is a much more
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
expensive way for the state to pay for
 
01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
meeting their needs so it's kind of
 
01:38:58.370 --> 01:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's a it's a balancing act
 
01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
um this is sort of an unresolved one at
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
the next one
 
01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:07.610 align:start position:0%
the next one
um

01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
is ambulance
 
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
and this is one where you where the
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
legislature approved moving the rates
 
01:39:15.719 --> 01:39:18.350 align:start position:0%
legislature approved moving the rates
from

01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
you look at the the blue heading columns
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
the rates that existed prior to
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature's actions that we were
 
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:29.750 align:start position:0%
the legislature's actions that we were
running

01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
running
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
you know depending on the service as low
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
as 22 percent of Medicare and up to you
 
01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
know 38 was the high
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
here the commissioner and I have
 
01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
received phone calls that
 
01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:44.629 align:start position:0%
received phone calls that
um

01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:46.729 --> 01:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
that nursing homes and hospitals are
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
having difficulty
 
01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.110 align:start position:0%
having difficulty
getting

01:39:50.110 --> 01:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
either patients to appointments for
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
medical appointments through uh and also
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
transfers between hospitals you know
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
just this week I got another complaint
 
01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.010 align:start position:0%
just this week I got another complaint
that

01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
um from three nursing facilities that
 
01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
the provider that's been helping them
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
get patients to hospitals that they're
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're basically saying to them we
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
can't serve you anymore we don't have
 
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
enough staff to do it we've got to
 
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
manage our payer mix and we're going to
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.770 --> 01:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
um then you know so the the 50 increase
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
um is in the orange you know kind of
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
where we stand today but you know again
 
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
when you look across
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
at other states
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
um we're still lagging there and and you
 
01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.070 align:start position:0%
um we're still lagging there and and you
know

01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:37.790 align:start position:0%
know
um

01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's an issue I think that uh
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
um when patients can't get transferred
 
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
um you know those costs get passed down
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
to municipalities who who have to
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe use their fire
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
department to transfer or they have to
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
pay additional money it's it's an issue
 
01:40:58.729 --> 01:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
that I think we all need to be concerned
 
01:40:58.739 --> 01:40:59.990 align:start position:0%
that I think we all need to be concerned
about

01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
um so again I think
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
um Workforce shortage inability to meet
 
01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
patients needs is something that we're
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:14.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
then um I think the last example I want
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
to share with you
 
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
um was uh hospice care
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
and this is one where we're paying
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
slightly more than Medicare and we're
 
01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
kind of pushed into that
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
um and that maybe it's not a bad thing
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
because of of concerns about people who
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
need hospice treatment but having to
 
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
apply across the board sometimes leads
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
in a result where maybe part of that
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
money could have been better used
 
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
and so and then the last two pages are
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
some work that started to do in terms of
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
looking at where our spend is
 
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
um in
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
um and paying claims this is only claims
 
01:42:06.290 --> 01:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
for comparing 22 to to 19
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
um just two years that we have sort of
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
complete information on so the
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic year
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
calendar year 19 and
 
01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:17.540 align:start position:0%
um sort of coming out of the pandemic 22
 
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of where
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
where the dollars are in terms of
 
01:42:24.649 --> 01:42:24.659 align:start position:0%
um you know when we need to make rate
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
adjustments I do have some other
 
01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
exhibits that are
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
I think I'll save to when I get to
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee that looks at that that
 
01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
80 20 kind of concept in terms of which
 
01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
codes you know get to
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
um you know the big account for a large
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of the spend and as I said I
 
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.870 align:start position:0%
percentage of the spend and as I said I
think

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219 align:start position:0%
I'm a professional category I can fit
 
01:42:52.129 --> 01:42:52.139 align:start position:0%
them all on one page pretty small and
 
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
get up to 80 and on on the waiver
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
programs I don't even need a full page
 
01:42:58.490 --> 01:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
and I can get to 100
 
01:42:58.500 --> 01:42:59.030 align:start position:0%
and I can get to 100
um

01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
so I think there's hopefully some of
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
this information is is helpful I know
 
01:43:06.649 --> 01:43:06.659 align:start position:0%
it's not all you want it's not all that
 
01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
I that I can produce it's just what I
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
could produce in the time frame I'm
 
01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:12.350 align:start position:0%
could produce in the time frame I'm
sorry

01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative okay uh thank you
 
01:43:19.729 --> 01:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
this is far more than we had just a few
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
days ago when we were hearing 3.1
 
01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
percent across the board so now we're I
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
think we're starting to think here and
 
01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
this is good so
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
um is is one of your one of your
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
takeaways that maybe if we're looking to
 
01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
rebalance the 3.1 percent and I mean we
 
01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
could just make it bigger right we could
 
01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
make it 5.1 percent theoretically but
 
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
but if we kind of wanted to stay within
 
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
a 3.1 percent pot and we wanted to
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
redistribute from one side of the pot to
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
or did I did I hear you write to imply
 
01:43:59.209 --> 01:43:59.219 align:start position:0%
that maybe our Hospice Services could
 
01:43:59.219 --> 01:44:00.169 align:start position:0%
that maybe our Hospice Services could
help

01:44:00.169 --> 01:44:00.179 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:44:00.179 --> 01:44:01.609 align:start position:0%
help
uh

01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
fund or reallocate from hospice and to
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
some of these other categories without
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
doing damage to the hospice
 
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
it just purely looking at as as a rate
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
issue if if if Medicaid is generally
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to just not pay more than
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare the answer I guess would be yes
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't know enough I haven't spent
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
enough time to understand the whole
 
01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
hospice situation and how it fits with
 
01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
home care agencies which may be
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
stressing on another side
 
01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
um follow-up so okay so pretending for a
 
01:44:35.209 --> 01:44:35.219 align:start position:0%
moment I'm not holding it you to it but
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
just for the purposes of the
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
conversation but I think you're getting
 
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
it so so if we find that hospice could
 
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
potentially be a place where we could
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
free up some money to reallocate
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere else which of these categories
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
because you have about eight slides
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
would where do you think is the most
 
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
critical that we may want to fund more
 
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
on a more urgent basis
 
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
well I think in terms of looking at it
 
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
from the Medicaid Program perspective I
 
01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.270 align:start position:0%
from the Medicaid Program perspective I
think

01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
probably mental health issues substance
 
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
use disorder issues ambulance issues is
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
that one of the slides you're saying
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
words that I don't think we just
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed on any of these slides they're
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
they're Professional Services of
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
that are um
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
that when we look get down to a code
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
level in that grouping you'll see
 
01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:32.570 align:start position:0%
level in that grouping you'll see
um

01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
could you refer to a page tell me what
 
01:45:37.129 --> 01:45:37.139 align:start position:0%
page it's not on a not on a page what
 
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is when you
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
I gave you a broad category if we drill
 
01:45:44.689 --> 01:45:44.699 align:start position:0%
down to the code level like you can look
 
01:45:44.699 --> 01:45:45.890 align:start position:0%
down to the code level like you can look
at

01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
um those types is that the kind of
 
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
information on the other two sheets that
 
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
you're bringing to the division three
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
and I think I've overstayed my welcome
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
but uh I know there's one more report
 
01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:15.659 align:start position:0%
all done thank you um I think you had
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
149 that you also wanted to get reported
 
01:46:21.649 --> 01:46:21.659 align:start position:0%
but yeah we can do it 149 a little bit
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
Yeah okay
 
01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity and

so we are happy to provide you with this

accordance with Senate Bill 149
 
01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:16.070 align:start position:0%
accordance with Senate Bill 149
um

yeah

01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:48:48.530 --> 01:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
we'll give it about 30 seconds so they
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:57.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:48:57.370 --> 01:48:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.890 --> 01:48:59.900 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is first and then
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
and you may go
 
01:49:12.169 --> 01:49:12.179 align:start position:0%
I I just want a uh a one sentence
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
definition of what the term spend down
 
01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.629 align:start position:0%
definition of what the term spend down
means

01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.729 --> 01:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
that's when an individual has too much
 
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
like for a granite Advantage so they
 
01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
have to then incur medical expenses
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
before Medicaid and once they meet that
 
01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
income level Medicaid will then begin to
 
01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:36.649 align:start position:0%
income level Medicaid will then begin to
pay

01:49:36.649 --> 01:49:36.659 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
um for any claims they're in fee for
 
01:49:41.209 --> 01:49:41.219 align:start position:0%
service and the spend down will
 
01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
generally have to be met every month
 
01:49:46.090 --> 01:49:46.100 align:start position:0%
unless they're on a six-month period
 
01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:48.050 align:start position:0%
unless they're on a six-month period
representative

01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:49.850 align:start position:0%
representative
Weber

01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
well I'm asking this because I know that
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
the honorable Ken snow would want me to
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
um does this mean that we
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
how how far have we progressed towards
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
his goal of
 
01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
upping the limits
 
01:50:09.290 --> 01:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
at which the spend down
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
has to start or or at the way the upping
 
01:50:16.010 --> 01:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
the limits at which the spend down ends
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
um and making it easier for the people
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
both the people who are subject to the
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
spend down as individuals and
 
01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
in particular the mental health centers
 
01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:32.219 align:start position:0%
who have to eat
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
the amount that can't be paid for until
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
the spend down happens I know his
 
01:50:41.330 --> 01:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
objective was closing that Gap and I'm
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
wondering how this report fits with that
 
01:50:46.729 --> 01:50:46.739 align:start position:0%
this report doesn't really have anything
 
01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
to do with increasing the um we call it

01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
increase to 888 dollars where prior to
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you well I I actually
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
do I think
 
01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.890 align:start position:0%
do I think
um

01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:24.770 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

01:51:24.770 --> 01:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:28.609 --> 01:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to absorb this
 
01:51:28.619 --> 01:51:30.850 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to absorb this
um

01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:30.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
so what I think I'm reading here
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
more than half of the people who are
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.890 --> 01:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
don't have to actually submit the
 
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
medical expenses every month how do you
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
so what this is actually saying is due
 
01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
01:52:02.689 --> 01:52:02.699 align:start position:0%
continuous eligibility enrollment during
 
01:52:04.609 --> 01:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 federal Public Health
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
Emergency they don't have to submit
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
their bills we do it systematically for
 
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
anybody who met their spend down on or
 
01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
after March 18th of 2020.
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
um but once that continuous eligibility
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
requirement ends then they will start
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
have to submitting the bills for the
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
spend down okay well that answered my
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
darn

01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%

Senators five house members plus two

alternates so that would be eight
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
members and therefore the Quorum would
 
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
have been five okay if I'm incorrect I'm
 
01:54:33.490 --> 01:54:33.500 align:start position:0%
