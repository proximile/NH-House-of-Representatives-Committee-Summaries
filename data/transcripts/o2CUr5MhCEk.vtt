miler

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
card yes please uh thank you chairman
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
lad my name is Mel Miler and I represent
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
maram 9 the gorgeous towns of hopkington
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
and Bo now I'm presenting uh 1594 for
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
this morning which is a bill that would
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
have an annual determination of the
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility awards for the freedom
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
account now the reason why I did this
 
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
was because
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
um my concern was that uh right now once
 
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
an individual becomes eligible for the
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
freedom accounts they stand their for
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
Life their life uh in school and I
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
thought that was
 
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
wrong uh primarily because most of
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
ours of which I believe this is since it
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
350% poverty level eligibility for a
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
family or for and I begin to think about
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
well what other poverty programs provide
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
annual review and I've passed out to you
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
a thing that I worked with the OS on and
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
you can see the various programs that in
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
fact do have an annual
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
review I want to draw your attention to
 
00:07:57.629 --> 00:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
the last item on the chart which is the
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund which
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
currently has about 45% of its students
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
that are currently getting an annual
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
review primarily those who have free and
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch and so my sense was is
 
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
that if you have 45% that are already
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
doing the the program obviously has a uh
 
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
system at which they monitor students
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
Etc uh to do this on an annual review
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
that we should do this on an annual
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
basis it's my belief that um as we
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
looked at the
 
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
efas that if you have a a parent for
 
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
example who has a child and let's say
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
the parent's 30 years old and is making
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know the 990,000 or so uh
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
eligibility as their as their salary
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
increases it seems to me that there
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
should be some at some point in time
 
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:46.949 align:start position:0%
should be some at some point in time
they

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
basically uh term out if you may uh
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
their eligibility for that so that's
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
really the intent of the bill uh it's a
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
fairly simple concept you can agree or
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
disagree with it but I think think there
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
are merits here that when you talk about
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
families who have to have annual reviews
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that uh they maintain
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
their eligibility that that's uh that's
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
really the intent of this film thank you
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative Myer
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
are questions for representative
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
Miler not seeing any oh yes
 
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.269 align:start position:0%
Miler not seeing any oh yes
representative

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%

Luna thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
you very much representative for taking
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
my question on the um on the handout
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
that you uh yes did this just come
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
around for the yes on 1594 um could you
 
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
comment again what it what it means in
 
00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:40.519 align:start position:0%
the the column that says eligibility
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
period Well I think it means that
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
annually you families who are in this
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
particular Center uh column that they
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
have to be renewed each year
 
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
okay so on maintain their maintain their
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
presence and involvement in the program
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
so followup thank you so on the on the
 
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
last one children's scholarship fund
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
when it says one year you're meaning
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill would
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
propose yes that they would have to do
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
it on an annual basis thank you so I'm
 
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't get that on the first
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
time thanks representative McDonald
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
representative Miler I'm looking at the
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
effective date which must have been an
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
oversight because it already has passed
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
but either way is this bill is there any
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
sort of phase out period so because
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
there are families who are expecting to
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
receive this funding in future years are
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
we just telling them that after when the
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
date passes are no longer to receive the
 
00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
funding well they they'll they'll
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
maintain their eligibility as long as
 
00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:43.959 align:start position:0%
they maintain that within the
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
350% of the poverty level so as long as
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
they maintain that level they'll stay in
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
the program if they go above that
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
through a review by the children's
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund then they would be out
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
out of that program okay may I have a
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
followup yes you may and then line 16
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
there's and be allocated to fund other
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
efas as removed to this bill could you
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
address the intent of that if the
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
funding has already been budgeted for
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
the EF program EFA program then why
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
would it return to the education trust
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
fund as opposed to funding for other
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
efas I guess I I don't would you state
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
your question again I'm not quite sure
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
what it is yes if the funding has
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
already been budgeted to be put towards
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
efas then why would it return back to
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
the trust fund as opposed to funding
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
another student's EFA account well
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a budget as I
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
understand it there's a budgeted amount
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
program excuse me there's a budgeted
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
amount within each budget and so
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
whatever money is available would be in
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
from that budget so if somebody doesn't
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
qualify that just means that whatever
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
that $5,000 is or whatever that is that
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
would just stay in that particular fund
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
voucher thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you spoke uh
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
to the um to the idea of renewing
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility each year but I didn't
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
really hear anything speaking to the the
 
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
elimination of the rollover from year to
 
00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
year can you speak a little bit to why
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
we would be changing that so that funds
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
are no longer rolling over year to year
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
but instead uh revert back to the trust
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
fund well I think if they're if they are
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
in fact ineligible for the program then
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
the money would say in the trust
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
fund follow up thank you if I may just
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
because I I I want to be certain I'm
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
reading correctly because I'm not I
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
don't quite read it the same way so uh
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
number two program funds and then uh
 
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.790 align:start position:0%
number two program funds and then uh
number

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
seven which are you represent which are
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
you referring
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
to you you mentioned seven and two and
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
seven I don't know what you're referring
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
to uh program fund so it's section two
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
and then uh Roman 7 okay any f en force
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
and going use funds should roll over
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
from quarter to quarter but then from
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
year to year was struck in this
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
legislation which tells me regardless of
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
whether the student is remaining
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
ineligible or becomes ineligible even if
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
they remain ineligible those funds would
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
no longer be allowed to roll over from
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
year to year is that your reading of
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
this yes thank you further questions
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative dry
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
question so just to follow up on that if
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
if we have if I had a suit who had an
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
account and for a year we were
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
ineligible for the fa account that money
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
would be gone and if we became eligible
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
again the next year it would be starting
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
from scratch is that correct I would
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
assume that would that if if this would
 
00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
go into effect rules would address that
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
issue thank you further questions from
 
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.949 align:start position:0%
issue thank you further questions from
the

00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
much like to call forward David
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:12.269 align:start position:0%
much like to call forward David
Trumble

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman good morning and
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee members um I support my name
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
is David Trumble from the town of wear I
 
00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:20.759 align:start position:0%
support this bill for a couple reasons
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
first I think the use of an annual
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
income eligibility guideline is
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with other governmental
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
programs that are based on income as
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative Myer stated I could not
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
see any other uh programs that used
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
income guidelines that didn't have an
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
annual program in the state it's also
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
worth noting that the educational
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
oversight committee majority report REM
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
recommended an annual review of income
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
why is this fair this is not about fraud
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
it's just if a parent one year is
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
unemployed and the next year is employed
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
then they're now over that income limit
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
or if they get promoted or their
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
self-employment business grow
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
this is just the way life goes people's
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
income goes up this bill would only
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
affect people whose income is above the
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
350% limit or if the 500% new rule it
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
would be people above the 500%
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
rule second is that 350% limit is pretty
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
high if you compare it to other programs
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
in the state that use annual income
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines for medicate it's
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
39,900 for low-income energy assistance
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
it's 60,000 for snap it's
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
39,000 Child Care scholarship program
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
for the $5 cost share is 41,000 so the
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
hund the 109,000 or
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
156,000 is very high compared to these
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
other programs what does that mean the
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
350% limit is the median New Hampshire
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
income for non-metro New Hampshire the
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Finance Authority says the
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
Statewide median income is
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
121,000 but for non-metro it's 106,000
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
so basically what this is saying is that
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
if you're in the upper half of income if
 
00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839 align:start position:0%
you started out at some point you were
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
under the lower half but you move up to
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
the upper half you're still being
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
subsidized by the people of the state if
 
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
you use the 500% limit and it looks like
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
that's likely to happen based on last
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
week's result that's the top 20% of
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
income in the state the uh New Hampshire
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy Institute just turned out
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
a report this year about Granite Staters
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
with the lowest incomes have the highest
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
effective tax rates and they tell us
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
153,00 and above is the top 20% so if if
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
the 500% rule is going forward basically
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is say if you
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
move into the top 20% the state is no
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
longer supporting your EFA program and
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem unreasonable when
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
people who are just going into the
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
$41,000 mark lose their Medicaid they
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
lose their SNAP benefits and they lose
 
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
their child scholarship programs
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
basically I think it just comes down to
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
oh the other question is who pays for
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
this it's the people in the lowerer
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
income brackets that New Hampshire
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy Institute said that the
 
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
people under 154,000 pay a higher tax
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
rate than people above it in fact they
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
said that families in the bottom 20%
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
have a combined tax rate more than three
 
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
times the rate of those in the top 1%
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's a regressive tax state in the state
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
so really what you're saying to people
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
who make 40,000 a year is you're going
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
to finance the education for people who
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
are now have moved into the $160 to
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
$200,000 range
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's not fair it's basically just a
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
question of fairness if your income
 
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
rises above the eligibility level then
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
you should no longer be eligible for the
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
program we have one set of rules for
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
low-income programs if your income goes
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
up you're out this creates a right now
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
we have a different set of rules for
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
high incomes even if your income goes up
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
you get to keep the benefit that's not
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
fair it's it's disrespectful I believe
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
to people who are participating in all
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
of the other Statewide programs thank
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from the
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
leus I'm
 
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.510 align:start position:0%
leus I'm
wondering

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
public trying to think of how to ask
 
00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.669 align:start position:0%
public trying to think of how to ask
this

00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
education and the efas are a one of the
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
recognized methods for getting an
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
education in the state and I'm wondering
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
so it should be compared to that rather
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
than these other things and so I'm
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
wondering do we means test traditional
 
00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.430 align:start position:0%
wondering do we means test traditional
public

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
education thank you representative leus
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
so two differences with public education
 
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
one is under Public Schools we have a
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional Duty as a state to
 
00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
finance those schools that's written in
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
our constitution it's been made clear by
 
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
the Claremont decision as for private
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
schools they are not mentioned in the
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution they're not included in the
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision we have no obligation
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
to finance private schools it's an
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
discretionary expense for the state so
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
they they're two completely different
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
luckus man every time I go to start to
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
ask a question my mind goes blank I'm
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry further questions represent
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you thank you for uh
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
being here again today um I wasn't clear
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
on what you meant by um funding private
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
schools I'm not sure who is funding
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
private schools okay um I should have
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
said funding the EFA program which uses
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
which allows people to use the money to
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
fund private schools but the point I was
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
simply making was is that the EFA
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
program is not constitutionally required
 
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire it's a
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
it's a choice that we've made to have in
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
this state if tomorrow this the state
 
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:15.559 align:start position:0%
had a tremendous Financial shortage and
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
it eliminated the EFA program that would
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
be constitutional there's no
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh block to that
 
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
happening but we have to continue to
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
finance our Public Schools
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
constitutionally followup um so I assume
 
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
you're not saying that the state should
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
not Institute any programs that are are
 
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
not specified in the Constitution am I
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
correct you're that's not the direction
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
you're going sorry there was two
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
negatives in there could you just say
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
that again represent um I assume you're
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
not saying that the state should not
 
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
Implement any programs that are not
 
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
specified in the Constitution I I seem
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
to hear that in in your comment I I
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
assume that's not what you mean I I'm
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
not saying that efas are
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and I'm my point today
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
was not that we should eliminate efas
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
what my point was just I was asked the
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
question why why does this not same set
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
of logic apply to Public Schools why do
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
we Finance public schools that have
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
people who are wealthy that attend and I
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
was trying to distinguish that the
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
public school is constitutionally
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
required you heard Andrew Linsky story
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
about how it came from the you know
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Constitution it's part of
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
the system of government every everybody
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the state benefits from it that's
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
what we agree as a set of norms if you
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
have public schools they have to follow
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
the rules like no discrimination if you
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
want to set up a private school you're
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
not bound by any of those rules so
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
therefore the state is not bound to
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
finance you but I'm not saying we should
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate funds to private schools I'm
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
just saying if you are going to have a
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
program like this it should at least
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
follow the same guidelines we do for
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
every other income based program in the
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
state when your income goes above that
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
number you no longer receive the
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
we unfund those parents because their
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
income went a little high you know
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
bumped up for whatever reason maybe they
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
have to replace their car and they took
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
an extra job for a little bit for
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
whatever reason their income had bumped
 
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
up for a little bit and they could no
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
longer afford whatever it was that they
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
were doing they would then most likely
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
revert to the public school and we'd be
 
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
revert to the public school and we'd be
paying

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
$20,000 to educate them rather than
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
$4,000 to educate them and that's what
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting so your question is if
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
they go to the public school it's
 
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
actually going to be more expensive and
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
you think the EFA saves money for the
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
towns basically yes okay so I I would
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
like to address that if I might Mr
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
chairman the question was asked my
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
conception of that is that that's a
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
theoretical savings I have never seen
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
any data that proves that it actually
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
happen and and I would I would urge you
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
to go to the convel lawsuit the judge
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
laid out the expense categories for in
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
the public schools the number one
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
expense is the teachers then comes the
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
facilities then comes excuse me the
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
other professionals such as your nurse
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
your guidance counsel your principal and
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
then you have instructional materials
 
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
which is a couple hundred a student
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
right now we have 4,000 students in the
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
EFA program 75% of them already go to
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
private schools 1,000 of them came from
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
public schools right those are the basic
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
numbers that we operate on here there's
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh 160 school districts and some almost
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
500 schools in the state that means that
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
under the EFA program each school in the
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
state has had two children who went from
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
the public school over to a private
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
school so just think about your local
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
school it's got 400 children in it two
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
of them went over to a private school
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
Under the EFA program does that affect
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
your teacher salaries the biggest effect
 
00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
no I mean if you have four classes of
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
fourth grade each 20 or 25 students
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
you're not going to lay off a teacher
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
because two students in the whole school
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
left you're not going to lay off the
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
principal or the nurse or the guidance
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
counselor or the person who meets you at
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
the desk you still have to fix the roof
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
you still have to heat the building and
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
put the lights on the only discretionary
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
expense that changes is the
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
instructional materials which is $300
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
per student so maybe having a child go
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
over to a private school 3 NFA saves the
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
town $300 per student but also don't
 
00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
forget that school now loses the $4,000
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
in base adequacy although they get back
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
a couple thousand for the first year or
 
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
two it's a little confusing but
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
basically they they save 300 but they
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
lose 2,000 so I would say that those two
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
children have now lost that school money
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
you would have to have dozens and dozens
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
and scores of children leaving before
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
there's any savings but at this point
 
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
the program is not saved in my mind
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
Public Schools a single
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
dollar thank you very much are there
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.669 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
represent

00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:02.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr Trumble for uh
 
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
for joining us this morning um just
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
based on what you're you're talking
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
about now and students that that exit
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
their public school and that under
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
certain conditions might return to their
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
public school um are are we seeing as as
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
now that we've got sort of three years
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
of data that are starting to come out um
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
on the uh the the education Freedom C
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
program are we seeing students that may
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
have exited their Public School in one
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
year then returning back to their public
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
school after another after a year of
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
maybe being out with an EFA it's really
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
unclear uh there's another category of
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
people who students who are kind of lost
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
in the numbers who they don't know what
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
happened to them there they went to a
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
private school but then they got lost
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
and there was somebody who testified
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
that somebody from this from the uh EFA
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
program was a number keeper of that
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
explained that there's some that they
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
don't know about it's it's it's it's
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
some percentage I don't know I mean
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
maybe they graduated maybe they dropped
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
out maybe they returned back to to
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
public school I do know from just
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
reading about how EFA type programs or
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
voucher type programs whatever they're
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
called different things around the
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
country many parents especially special
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
ed parents are used to a public school
 
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
where you get an e you get an IEP and
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
everything that's in that you have a
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
right to then they go to a a through a
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
voucher program in other states which
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
what they're called in those States
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
voucher programs they don't know what
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
they're getting into they don't realize
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
that they're giving up their their
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
rights they they have to sign away their
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
their Federal rights they get to the
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
private school and find out that they
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
have one special educator who does all
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
the special ed for the building and may
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
not be trained in their child's and then
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
they start looking for other private
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
schools and maybe they go back to the
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
public school so I don't have the
 
00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
numbers that's one of the basic problems
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
with this program is it keeps expanding
 
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a really good grip on
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
how it's working so I don't know but I
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh I wish I could give you an answer
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr chairman I have no
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
more cards on this so I'm going to close
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
this hearing down and we'll start the
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:33:22.669 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead with the
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
next hearing the next hearing on the
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
dock is
 
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
1287 this is an act relative to the
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
definition of the term evidence-based
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
within public education welcome
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative beler thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee good
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
morning this bill um is primarily about
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
directing this state and our education
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
not the curriculum but the methods by
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
which we use educate to be rooted in a
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
in a properly defined
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
scientific process so first imagine the
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
two following questions that each
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
generate data the first question is this
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
program when instituted demonstrates on
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
average a 10% increase in standardized
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
test scores apologies that's not a
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
question but it's a statement of fact
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
that contains data the second question
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
true or false I feel like students are
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
more capable of Performing after doing
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
both of those items generate data but
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
the data they generate is not
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
equal first science operates by
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
attempting to falsify a claim the more
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
attempts to falsify a claim that a claim
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
survives the higher degree of certitude
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
we can have that the claim is
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
true the second question posed based in
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
feelings and subjectivity
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
is fundamentally not
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
falsifiable therefore it cannot be said
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
to represent real good
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
science far too often in the history of
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
education have we relied on this second
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
data this has resulted in the adoption
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
of suboptimal methods suboptimal
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
outcomes and significant Wast in time
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
and money
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
there is no need for us to continue to
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
do this all across this nation and
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
across this world colleges of education
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
and other related fields are constantly
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
pushing out studies peer reviewed good
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
science studies demonstrating methods
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
that can be efficacious or disproving
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
methods but saying that oh absolutely
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
actually this doesn't work we find that
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
out all the
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
time if we want to improve
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes and do the best by our students
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
we must eliminate
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
nonscience and pseudo science-based data
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
from our evaluations of the methodology
 
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.030 align:start position:0%
from our evaluations of the methodology
being

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
used we should only be using objective
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
verifiable data based on falsifiable
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
hypotheses now to the cost of
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
this this shouldn't cost much of
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
anything to our state or to our local
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
subdivisions in this in this
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
state this law allows for localities and
 
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
those adopting these pedagogical methods
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
to demand of the providers of textbooks
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
and other such methods that they furnish
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
them with the studies that they relied
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
upon when creating their
 
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
products in other words the textbook
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
providers and others should already have
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
this data they already should have used
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
it when they put their text together all
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
we ask them to do is furnish it to us
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
the state and or those adopting this so
 
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
they can in turn furnish this to the
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
public this is a hugely necessary item
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
transparency is Paramount this is the
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
way science works it science works by
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
continually attempting to falsify
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
information and claims by putting this
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
information out publicly it allows
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
parents it allows teachers and allows
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
experts in various Fields all over the
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
country and all over the world to look
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
at the studies we're relying upon and
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
say hey this is a good study or maybe
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's not and they can raise a concern
 
00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:40.870 align:start position:0%
it's not and they can raise a concern
with

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
it and according to this basic logic if
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
the methods being utilized are in fact
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
efficacious if they work they should be
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
no problem whatsoever to identify two or
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
more studies from educational related
 
00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:57.550 align:start position:0%
more studies from educational related
fields

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
fields
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
that actually say yeah this we tried to
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
falsify this concept and we couldn't so
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:06.430 align:start position:0%
 
concept

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
concept
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
further we will be throwing a wrench
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
into the occasional bad
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
habits of major education corporations
 
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
and those sometimes producing the
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
textbooks of making frequent
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
changes that they might update their
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
textbooks to sell more textbooks and
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
more new classes it's been a longterm
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
problem within the field of Education
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
this concept of chasing fads and we
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
would by doing this and relying on good
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
science take away the necessity or the
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
even ability to constantly update things
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.270 align:start position:0%
 
things

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
finally this has no direct bearing on
 
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
the individual teacher or classroom that
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
was not the intent of this bill that
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
bird the teacher with anything
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
whatsoever it is specifically written to
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
this that it shall not be enforced at
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
that level this is all about those
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
people those organizations such as the
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
the doe and local school boards who are
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
adopting the pedagogical methods that
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
classrooms it does bind the state
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
accepting higher education and their
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
freedom of Education to conform to this
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
proper definition of the term
 
00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.990 align:start position:0%
proper definition of the term
evidence-based

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
and it does so to eliminate any
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
possibility of misuse of the term that
 
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
could see false scientific Concepts
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
being legitimized under the banner of
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and that's what it does
 
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take questions thank you
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
very much other questions from the
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
committee represent cordelli thank you
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
um whose evidence are you relying on and
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
evidence I I assume you mean if if the
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
bill were were to pass whose evidence
 
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
would we be relying upon we would be
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
relying upon the evidence um produced by
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
professional journals professional
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
colleges in order to the the the persons
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
who uh actually do design studies the
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
ones they're typically involved in peer
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
review though they don't necessarily
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
have to be um and they would that would
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
be the data and evidence we would rely
 
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
upon for pedagogical
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
methods yes um uh a couple of months ago
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
during the presidential c campaign uh
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
there was a little um uh discussion
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
about the uh causes of the Civil
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
War um
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
what um and different
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
viewpoints um what evidence would you
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
rely on um for discussion in uh
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum or classroom as to the causes
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
of the Civil War whose evidence would
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
that be relied on well thank you for the
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
question but this bill doesn't actually
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
speak to that because that would be a
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum matter and this is purely
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with pedagogical methods not not
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum or or what is true or false
 
00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
in curriculum it's a matter of how
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
things are to be taught in terms of
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
efficacy of methods one last question
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um last year I had a bill
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
related to
 
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
literacy and for decades we relied on um
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
the U methods uh outlined in terms of
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
teaching reading by Lucy ckins and um
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
others um who agreed with her um methods
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
um and that was evidence-based it was
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
written up in the journals Columbia uh
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
University had um a unit um specifically
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
related to that in terms of uh
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
instruction but that was disprove so
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
that was evidence
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
based so now after
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
Decades of research and including brain
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
studies on how students learn to read um
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
there is new
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
evidence um the science of reading if
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
you will um that um has been objected to
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
by some um so in terms of literacy what
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
evidence should we rely on um Lucy cins
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
evidence or um other evidence that has
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
been gathered over the past couple of
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
decades thank you for that and that that
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
really highlights some of the importance
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
of of what I'm talking to in this bill
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
so we we have to understand that there
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
is no such thing as a perfect science we
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
don't have perfect information in this
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
world about really anything it's about
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
trying to improve our understanding of
 
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
things over time and as such we do have
 
00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
to recognize that science because it is
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
constantly testing falsifiable claims
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
may eventually falsify a claim which
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
means the science itself can
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
legitimately change that's something
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
that can happen which is a matter that
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
is addressed in this bill because it
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's not about making the perfect
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
the enemy of the good it's about saying
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
that we should be doing the best we can
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
even though it's not going to be perfect
 
00:43:17.549 --> 00:43:17.559 align:start position:0%
and how do we identify the best at any
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
given time that we can do and I think
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's the the angle that you're
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
speaking to as well in this and and
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
that's a a approach I would report to
 
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
good objective scientific evidence being
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
used in pedagogical
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
methods I I do have a question sort a
 
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
little bit followup to where repesent
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
Celli was coming from can evidence-based
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
as you define that be based upon
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
historical research that is premised
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
upon studying and understanding causes
 
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
and effects of trends that occurred in
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
the past to anticipate where we're going
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
future I think I have an idea of what
 
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to um so this bill in
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
terms of evidence-based excuse me it
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
would allow the consideration of any
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
evidence-based so a properly designed
 
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
study so a historical study could be
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
included um
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
however the bill does leave the
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
obviously can't fix everything the bill
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
does leave the possibility that you
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
could address old science and ignore
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
some new science but that's why the
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
transparency is so important it's
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
because people can look at this parents
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
whoever can look at this and say hey
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
this is this is old son this is an old
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
study and we have newer studies that
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
actually have falsified that claim in
 
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
the meantime so it's it's something that
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
can be updated and it can be updated
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
according to a legitimate objective
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
measurement as opposed to updating
 
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.549 align:start position:0%
measurement as opposed to updating
constantly

00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
constantly
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
based on more subjective matters which
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
are not an optimal way to do things
 
00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good morning thank you chairman
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
L Rob uh I'm thinking about the
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
practicality okay um I'm looking at Mich
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
on your uh particularly in respect to
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
line 14 and 15 not sort the line but the
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
the inference if we're talking about um
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
including educator
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
training okay um I'm thinking about the
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
different schools of philosophy and the
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
different schools of
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
training uh that folks come from we have
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
in this committee seven or eight n
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
former teachers may have been trained at
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine different colleges some
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
private some Catholic some maybe Greek
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
some public I mean so they have
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
different philosophies some more
 
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
Socratic you know what they thinking so
 
00:45:56.829 --> 00:45:56.839 align:start position:0%
I don't understand understand how we're
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
going to be able from a practical
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh where it comes to
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
including educator training uh how we
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
could make this applicable at work sure
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh that's a very important
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
point so this doesn't seek to address
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
historical issues with people having
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
been trained in different places and
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
having different philosophies and in
 
00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
fact there's plenty of room within this
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
for different philosophies to exist
 
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
because I do know for a fact that these
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
different philosophical doctrines from
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
education are individually and
 
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
separately producing their own
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed studies
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
so if they want to be able to continue
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
in that same manner all they would have
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
to do is is identify the for instance
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
the College of Education that is
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
teaching this philosophy we just have to
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
identify two or more studies that are
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
proper peer review or they don't even
 
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
have to be peer review but they have to
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
be properly properly well-designed
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
studies that justify that methodology of
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
of of approach and I I mean there's more
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
than one way to skin a cat there's more
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
more than one way to teach a child so
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to have differences of
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
approaches that can be separately
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
verified to be be effective and that
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is all free to exist perfectly fine
 
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.190 align:start position:0%
that is all free to exist perfectly fine
under

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
here thank you sir um to the same
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
extent how in the practicality piece of
 
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:08.829 align:start position:0%
extent how in the practicality piece of
this

00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
thing how are we going to regulate that
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
the nine different schools those folks
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
around this room went to are going to
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
participate in this I go to the if I go
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
Ohio State or uccla or B cookman and I
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
come here we can't ensure all those
 
00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:26.839 align:start position:0%
three school and all of are going to
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
provide education evidencebased
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
education pedagogy
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
instruction correct yes this this has no
 
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
ability we have no ability to regulate
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
anything that's happening out of state
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody learned methods that are not
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
optimal that that that don't stand up to
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
criticism and study and they come here
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be any immediate uh
 
00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
effect to this but what we can control
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
is our continuing education of Educators
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
that occurs in the state and to make
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
sure that that continuing education does
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
do occur along lines that are actually
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
based on good objective data sets that
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
would be that last last thing yes thank
 
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
you so that would be the profession
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
development once this The Faculty are on
 
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
board in different schools in New
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it wouldn't really be the
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
education training would be the
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
professional development continued yes
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you chairman lad
 
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.309 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you chairman lad
represent

00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
leus thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
question you use the term
 
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.549 align:start position:0%
question you use the term
reproducibility

00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
reproducibility
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if you can Define that
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
reproducible in the same circumstances
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
or is that reproducible say in this case
 
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
across districts across ages across
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
types of kids Etc thank you for that
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
that's a very important point to clarify
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
so reproducibility in this is actually
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
talking about the scientific
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
reproducibility of studies meaning that
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
if you do you conduct a study on a
 
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
methodology and it demonstrates okay
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
that we have this positive out outc come
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
this positive effect it we did not
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
falsify a truth claim and then another
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
study is necessary this is why I've
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
written this requires two or more
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
studies from education or related
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
fields another study then is done that
 
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
confirms that and that is
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
reproducibility the ability to confirm
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
the same result in in in repeatable
 
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
studies thank you represent
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
question so I feel like I'm hearing a
 
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
conflict between some of what you're
 
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
stating and some of the language in the
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
bill so I would hope you can clarify
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
sure on line seven and8 it reads the
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
general court believes that while peer
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
review of studies has uses including
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
evaluating the proper design of studies
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
peer review alone has no weight in
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
evaluating or falsifying claims but I
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
believe I've just heard you validate the
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
usefulness of peer review multiple times
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
so correct I don't understand uh so So
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
within the scientific process what peer
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
review is primarily good for and what it
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
was primarily originally intended for is
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
the ability of persons who have
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
expertise in these sorts of data and and
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
studies to determine if the study itself
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
is properly designed to meet and produce
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
the criteria the kind of data that we
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
want to see but when it comes to whether
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
something is true or false peer review
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
has no no effect on whether something is
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
actually true or false it stands alone
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
as is as a true item or a false item and
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's all this is
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
saying further further questions yes you
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
have a followup to
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.589 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
so since peer
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
review could and
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
does validate or invalidate study
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
design how is that not a credible piece
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
of what the results of that study are I
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
mean it if it didn't pass muster for
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
peer review then you don't trust the
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
results of the study I I think we're
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
we're crossing on so what I'm what I'm
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
referring to is purely an
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
epistemological issue so how do we
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
verify a truth claim and the fact is
 
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
something is either true or it's not
 
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
depending on and that doesn't matter
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
what people say about it so in that
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
regard peer review the fact that certain
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
people think it's true or false doesn't
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
actually affect whether or not it is
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
actually true or false but they are
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
useful because they have expertise in
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
this area for helping to guide us in our
 
00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.190 align:start position:0%
this area for helping to guide us in our
decision-

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
making further questions from the
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
committee representative dry thank you
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking this question
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
can you maybe illustrate for us what the
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
local school districts and Department
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
making publicly available the scientific
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
studies they relied on would look like
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
sure I and I left it kind of open-ended
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
so they could pursue different ways of
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
doing this it could be a matter of they
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
have it available and upon request they
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
will provide it such as something like
 
00:51:58.789 --> 00:51:58.799 align:start position:0%
under 91a would be or they could choose
 
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
to publish this kind of stuff to a
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
website and say hey this is the uh the
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
me methodology we're using and this is
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
this the two or more studies that that
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the efficacy of this
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
technique further questions from the
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative Tanner okay
 
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I actually have two questions
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
but they're kind of related one um is
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
whether this is based on um legislation
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
in other states and part of it National
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and which standardized test
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh were you referring to when you said
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
PE people do better in scientific um
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
with your methodology rather than um
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
what's currently being
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
offered um so the the first one um I
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
referred to nothing when I created this
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
this was from scratch from scratch from
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
scratch um on the second question could
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
you rephrase it because I'm not sure I
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
probably you referenced in the beginning
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
that uh you have found that in
 
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
standardized tests students that are
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
exposed to this do better than the the
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
common practice and I'm thinking we
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
don't do this um and so it isn't our
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
standardized tests in New Hampshire so
 
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
which standardized tests are you looking
 
00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
at thank you so I I think there was a
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
bit of a misunderstanding on that that
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
that's probably my fault I didn't speak
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
it appropriately so I was simply
 
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
providing two hypothetical examples to
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrate two different types of data
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
one type of data is objective data uh an
 
00:53:33.309 --> 00:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
improvement and standardized test scores
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
that can be documented the other type is
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
subjective data based on a true or false
 
00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
I feel like students are more capable um
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
as of right now the term evidence base
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
would treat those two data sets
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
identically with equal weight it's my
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
contention that that second data set
 
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
based in subjectivity should not be
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
given the weight of an objective data
 
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
set such as a demonstrated increase in
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
test scores so it's hypothetical I'm not
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
referring to anything real that is
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
actually happening it's just to
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the difference between those
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
two types of
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
data thank followup just to make sure
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
I'm clear on this because when you
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
started out your introduction said that
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
students do better on standardized tests
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
when they're exposed to this
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um scient in Education
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
Act rather than what they do presently
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
and I'm just asking what standardized
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
test did you base that on and where did
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
it come from thank you just to clarify I
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
did not in fact say that what I said was
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
imagine the two following questions that
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
generate data I did not claim that this
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
was based on any any program they were
 
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.150 align:start position:0%
was based on any any program they were
purely

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
purely
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals representative
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair I'd like like to
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
ask you a question about verifiable
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
through history or things like that I
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
realize that we're talking about
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
post Haw Ergo propter Haw which is
 
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
commonly argued this happened but
 
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
therefore that happened and it's proven
 
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
to be pretty well false it didn't
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily cause and so you're when you
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
get down to arguing causality I.E truth
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
or some version of
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
Truth what do you run into when you're
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
as in the argument you talked about the
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
cause of the Civil War that was recently
 
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
and can you make that case based
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
on the subject of slavery did not appear
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
in the public argument here's the
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
document of the arguments sure because
 
00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:39.039 align:start position:0%
until Abraham Lincoln introduced it at a
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
certain point to sway the argument as he
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
admitted sure so first let let me be
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
very clear that this bill does not touch
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
kurriculum it only touches pedagogical
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
methods so it would not be evaluated or
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
looking at things like the cause of the
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
Civil War or other items that would be
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
covered within curriculum it would only
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
be looking at like well what's the most
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
effective method to teach kids to read
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
or to do math and is this method can we
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
demonstrate here's a here's a truth
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
claim the truth claim is this method of
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
teaching math uh is an improvement over
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
our current setup so we evaluate that
 
00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
truth claim based on okay let's put it
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
to a study let's try this method and
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
let's take some objective measurements
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
from it look at test scores let's look
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
at other performance metrics and say
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
okay can we can we demonstrate that this
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
truth claim is false if we can't
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
demonstrate it's false and the more
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
often we test it and can't demonstrate
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
that it's false the more likely it is to
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
be true so we would Institute that
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
method based on these well-designed
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
scientific studies to improve things
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
like math education and reading
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
education but has nothing to do with
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum or what students are being
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
taught representative
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
cascaden uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
for um taking my question I'm wondering
 
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't dispute that
 
00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based methods should be applied
 
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
must be applied um I'm wondering if you
 
00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
have a specific example as
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
to where or what was implemented that
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
was not
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um and I'll tell you what
 
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
the reality is in the public school
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
setting as a principal for over 20 years
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
I had a lot of responsibility on
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
purchasing materials changing methods
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
strategies techniques based on evidence
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
I mean that is a must I mean I agree
 
00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
with you that um and in particular
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
because we're spending the taxpayers
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
money that better be all out on the
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
table um but sometimes we have vetted
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
programs or methods for well over a year
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
before we've actually jumped and
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
Incorporated so just wanted you to know
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
the reality is that sometimes it takes
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
one two 3 years to change a method or a
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
technique sure because you're vetting
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
that evidence so I I'm questioning do
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
you have a specific example that I can
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
understand why there's a need for this
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you so I'll deal
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
with that backwards forward so um to
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
start the the the issue is being able to
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
properly evaluate that evidence and what
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
the evidence means and where it's coming
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
from and that is why in my opinion is so
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
important to differentiate data sets
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
between subjective and objective
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
measures because I do know and i' I've
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
seen some of the surveys that are
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
currently being done in schools as far
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
as asking teachers to evaluate like how
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
this program is working in terms and
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
they will ask questions like do you
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
think this program is working better
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
than your previous program um and they
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
will rely to significant degree they
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
will put a significant amount of weight
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
on those kind of responses um in
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
comparison to things like well well is
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
this reflected in objective standards
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
such as test scores graduation rates and
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
any other objective metric can be that
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
can be pulled out of this in order to
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
evaluate it um so I think there is a
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
real problem that is happening currently
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
where there is too much subjective data
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
being collected and being utilized in
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
determining how efficacious these
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
various methods are and when it comes to
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
specifics all I think we have to do is
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
look at the history of um teaching math
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
or teaching reading that we have in fact
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
jumped into into certain areas where we
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
thought things were going to be good and
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
then later those truth claims were
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
falsified and we found out actually
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
that's not so good maybe it's not ideal
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
so what this does and I can't say it's
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to fix everything all the time
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to be perfect but what
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
it would do is by making sure we utilize
 
00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
objective measures instead of subjective
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
we are aiming toward the direction of
 
00:59:52.109 --> 00:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
reality itself instead of what people's
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
perceptions might be and I think that
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
elimin Ates a lot of potential for bias
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of potential for other issues
 
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.109 align:start position:0%
and a lot of potential for other issues
that

00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
happen yes so you're referring to
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
surveys in terms of like School climates
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
just an example of one I'm I'm not so if
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
if students completed a survey about
 
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.150 align:start position:0%
if students completed a survey about
school

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
climate um and it meant that okay let's
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
um let's do something about wherever the
 
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:20.839 align:start position:0%
deficit is that if it's not
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
evidence-based that you can't make that
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
change I not exactly sure how you would
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
Define School climate because this is
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
really just referring to pedagogical
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
methods so it's not in academics in
 
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:32.839 align:start position:0%
academics so it's not it's not looking
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
at like well how do I feel about this
 
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
thing I mean you can collect that kind
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
of data it just can't be used to back up
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
a pedagogical
 
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
method represent
 
01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you first um don't
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
teachers um routinely on a day-to-day
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
basis change instructional methods
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
depending on the situation depending on
 
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
the student um and those aren't
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily evidencebased they're based
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
on student need so I'm not sure how a
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
teacher would specify what they're doing
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
is evidence-based thank you and they
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
would not have to because it is it is
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
explicitly written to this legislation
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
that it does not apply at the level of
 
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
the individual teacher or individual
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
classroom it is only for those school
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
boards and doe and others who are
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
adopting more broad brush these
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
pedagogical methods yes um several years
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
ago um the state switched kindergarten
 
01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
instruction from a more academic based
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
model to a play-based
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
instruction and uh I I know there was
 
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
great debate about that for several
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
years and um many people brought forward
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
evidence about test scores you know once
 
01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
they reached a greater um uh grade
 
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
levels uh with the academic instruction
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
um focus on kindergarten but others
 
01:02:09.069 --> 01:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
brought forward studies um about play
 
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
based instruction and outcomes so
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
who's who's I go back to the question
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
whose evidence do you rely on when there
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
are conflicting studies that that's an
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
excellent question and this this bill is
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
not designed to arbitrate between what
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
evidence-based methods are utilized it
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
is just to limit the overall scope of
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at to objective
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
measures instead of subjective ones so
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
we know that when we are deciding what
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
evidence-based measures to implement and
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
utilize that at least we're looking at
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
objective measures and things that are
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
connected to reality and have been
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
studied as opposed to things that are
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
collecting surveys on how do you feel
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
about this how this
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
works well we're getting really per name
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
one more question that's we're going to
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
call it quits
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.029 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
another

01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
question I would like to hear why the
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
bill only addresses this uh approach in
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
public education and not everywhere that
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
our tax dollars support
 
01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
education that was purely a matter of
 
01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
where it seems to me we have the most
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
obvious jurisdiction in regulating and I
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
didn't want to overstep with
 
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
this thank you very much um thank you
 
01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
very much we're g to call quits on the
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
questions at this point and I'd like to
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
go on with the other people that have
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
submitted pink cards here um like to
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
svy good morning uh representative vad
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
Emma Sven I the children's Behavioral
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
Health policy coordinator at new Futures
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
new Futures is a nonprofit nonpartisan
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
organization that solves problems
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
through part uh policy change we're here
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
um in opposition to 128 House Bill 1287
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
um just out of fear of some unending
 
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
consequences to the bill I think um
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
while we understand the the commendable
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
um intent behind the bill I think there
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
are some practices that are in schools
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
already under a the phrase
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice that could be
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
Exempted then from this definition
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
that's being put forth um and
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
furthermore removing the phrase peer
 
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
studied or removing the regard to peer
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
studied um can reduce the uh like
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
legitimacy of studies so to speak um
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
peer reviewed is an important piece of
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
having a well-designed study um and it
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
makes a study what what it is um it
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
makes a study rep replicable or um
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
reliable so um there's been a lot of
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
conversation up at the higher level um
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences we're
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
foreseeing are uh in regard to social
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
emotional learning um and the
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered system of support or
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
mtssb um these are uh Frameworks that
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
schools and school districts Implement
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
through evidence-based practices so um
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
for social emotional learning so to
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
speak that's a framework and the school
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
will Implement an evidence-based
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
practice to implement social emotional
 
01:05:34.269 --> 01:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
learning so as we were all here last
 
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
week um for the uh bill on social
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
emotional learning the school districts
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
will Implement um you know classes or or
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
some type of uh learning for students to
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
um have that social emotional learning
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
component to their education um this
 
01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:54.630 align:start position:0%
component to their education um this
evidence-based

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
is defined um in many places but it is
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
pertaining to um or derived from
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
informed and informed by objective
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
science most commonly educational
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
research or the metrics of schools
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
teachers that sort of thing so it is
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
already defined in data and in fact
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
there is a federal statute the um educ
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
every student succeeds act that defines
 
01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
evidence-based as requiring studies um
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
and it has a separate definition um and
 
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
explains how schools can select their
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices already from
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
various levels or tiers of
 
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices that are
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
defined by different studies and study
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
types that definition differs slightly
 
01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:45.079 align:start position:0%
from the definition included in this
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill in a way that I think could exclude
 
01:06:49.269 --> 01:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
some of the evidence-based practices
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
that are already successfully being
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
implemented in schools and that we're
 
01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
seeing are working well
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
um right now our students are suffering
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
from mental health consequences they
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
based on the ybs are having um High
 
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
rates of depression anxiety suicidal
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
ideation and behaviors um right now it
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
would be really detrimental to our
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
students to change or add a definition
 
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily that could take away those
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
practices that are already being
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
implemented and implemented with success
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
um so for those reasons uh new features
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
is opposed to this bill I'm happy to
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
take questions I know that this is um
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a a bill that touches more than
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
just social emotional learning so I'm
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions as they pertain
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
Tok area questions from the committee
 
01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you thank you
 
01:07:46.269 --> 01:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
for being here um so correct me if I'm
 
01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
wrong but I I think you're I heard you
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
say that social emotional learning was
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
evidence-based so the framework is uh
 
01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
like a a theory so to speak and then the
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
evidence-based is the method it's
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
delivered to students so um there can be
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
various uh practices so to speak that
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
are evidence-based that are delivered to
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
schools and that's how schools do it and
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
successfully further questions from the
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee represent Dr thank you and
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you just kind of follow up on that
 
01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
um that sounds to me that that's more
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
like the curricul part which he said
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't affected by the
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
evidence-based so that's where it gets a
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
little confusing with this bill as well
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
and why it's a
 
01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
little I think an unintended consequence
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
um that we're just concerned about so
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
the curriculum piece yes there are
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
schools that have set curriculum for
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
seal that's Exempted by this bill but
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
there are other pieces of seal that are
 
01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
just embedded in our day-to-day schools
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
and the way that people administer
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:54.590 align:start position:0%
and the way that people administer
education

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not an educator but um for my
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
understanding um seal is delivered
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
through you know encouraging students to
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
work together um on the playground and
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
not be bullies or something like that so
 
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
um that type of non-curriculum
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
learning is also happening and I believe
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
would be looped in on this definition
 
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay and I think that that that kind
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
of lends to representative cordell's
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
question about whether teachers can
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
change their their method of dealing
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
with particular students so it seems to
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
me like that falls under that category
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
more than
 
01:09:37.709 --> 01:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
pedagogy un absolutely so yes uh that
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
was not a great example of exactly
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
um let me back up so yes teachers are
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
Exempted as you mentioned but school
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
districts are implementing seal on a
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
districtwide level and so that
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
districtwide level is what would not be
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
Exempted by this bill and that's where
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
our concern is further questions from
 
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you very much thank
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.149 align:start position:0%
 
Elizabeth

01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
scrutin have your children's trust yes
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
good morning you um thank you chair and
 
01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Liz scrutin
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
I work at New Hampshire children trust
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
who is the New Hampshire lead Agency on
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
the prevention of child abuse and
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
neglect um and today I'm adding my voice
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the proposed science
 
01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
and education bill um particularly that
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
definition of the evidence base that
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
everybody has been referring to um
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
echoing what Emma said um while the
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill is really
 
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
commendable uh in seeking to ensure the
 
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.630 align:start position:0%
commendable uh in seeking to ensure the
quality

01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
quality
 
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
pedological uh methods the
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
implementation as outlined is a little
 
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
flawed and potentially harmful uh to the
 
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
very students it aims to serve um as we
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
consider the implications of this bill
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
um it's essential to recognize that
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
foundational importance of the social
 
01:11:00.669 --> 01:11:00.679 align:start position:0%
emotional competence in children um the
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
streng strength thing of families
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
approach which is implemented in some
 
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
schools um is one of those peer-reviewed
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
processes um where it does have the
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
research behind it but is not considered
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um but esteemed
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
institutions such as the American
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics Annie Casey
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
Foundation Center of child um for
 
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
Harvard University all unders score that
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
um we know that research is highlighting
 
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
that promoting social and emotional
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
confidence in a child's developmental
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
Years also makes measurable impact on
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
families um by fostering these
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
relationships by giving the more uh
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
personalized approach to social
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
emotional learning we see that family
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
stressors also come off of this because
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
we know that um social emotional
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
competence can play such a role in a
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
child's behaviors in and out of
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
school uh so by narrowly defining this
 
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
evidence-based prti practice this bill
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
really undermines the creation of
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
supporting learning environments which
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
are named in the cdc's essentials for
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
childhood as a strategy of decreasing
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
the risk of child abuse and
 
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
neglect um so in conclusion while
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
promoting evidence-based practices is
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
commendable that this act fails to
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
consider that holistic nature of Child
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
Development are there any questions from
 
01:12:16.719 --> 01:12:17.510 align:start position:0%
Development are there any questions from
the

01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%

1453 uh and I'll get ahead of any
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
questions I I wrote this bill all on my
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
own it's not based on any national
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
framework or uh or or prescription so um
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
and um and in the basically in the
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
nutshell um 1453 establishes a minimum
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
standard for uh for the state's higher
 
01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
education commission which is part of
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
our Department of Education uh a minimum
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
standard for uh for approving uh
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education for
 
01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
degree granting Authority and um and
 
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
occasionally this committee will hear uh
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
from um uh uh from new institutions of
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
higher education that are interested in
 
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
operating inside the state of New
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and conferring degrees upon
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
its graduates um and um and that's
 
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
something that is uh is subject to to
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
both uh our approval as a legislature
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
and uh and and subject to the high
 
01:14:26.189 --> 01:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
education commission's recommendation uh
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
for approval so again this bill is
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
establishing just uh just a minimum deck
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
for uh for what that uh entails so um so
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
let me just sort of run through what uh
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
what that means um and how the bill
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that unfortunately the uh
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
the provision in law in RSA 292 colon
 
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
8h is not contained in our um in our law
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
books um and I suspect it may be because
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
it what has not been amended in the last
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh in the last year but uh but it's a
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward section of Law
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
and and I'll just sort of you know give
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
you a little context of it right now the
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
section applies to all education
 
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
institutions within the state granting
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
degrees or seeking to do so except the
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
following a any institution now granting
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
degrees which has been in continuous
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
operation since before
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
1773 we know what that is
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that's one so so uh and um and the
 
01:15:30.669 --> 01:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
second one is institutions of the
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire and
 
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
institutions of the community college
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire so uh so
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
basically the section of law applies to
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
any other um
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
U private uh organization that's uh
 
01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
that's seeking to become operated as a
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
as a Institute of high Ed in the state
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and conferred degrees
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
um no Institute no educational
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
institution shall Grant degrees unless
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
approved by the higher education
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
commission and authorized by name to do
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
so by an act of the legislature so
 
01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
that's what I was just talking about
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
there's two parts of the process
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation by the department of Ed's
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
higher education commission and action
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
upon the
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and what the bill before you
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
does is it adds a a paragraph to what I
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
just read that says any institution
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
approved by their higher educ education
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
commission under paragraph two what I
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
just read shall be a nonprofit
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
organization exempt from income tax
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
under 501c3 501c3 IRS um statute so
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's the first part number two
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
complies with all provisions of the
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
institutional eligibility standards of
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
the higher education of act 1965 those
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
are civil civil rights protections that
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
were put in place at the federal level
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
and in particular con contain things
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
like title 4 with which is um which is
 
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh federally back student loans and
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
Title 9 which is um uh which is fairness
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
um and U and then the third piece is
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
complies with all applicable state and
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
federal anti-discrimination laws so and
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
um and the um the this language here was
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh was run by both the community college
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
and the university system uh Chad
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
Pimentel from who's the um the um
 
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh the the the council for the
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire uh
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
suggested that we put all applicable
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
state and federal anti-discrimination
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
laws in there using all applicable in
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
there so uh so which we have which we
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
have done so so this has been reviewed
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
so so these three things standards are
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
important standards are important to the
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we listen to
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
standards we look at standards all the
 
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
time represent beler was just here
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
talking about some uh some standards
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to um to to uh
 
01:17:59.629 --> 01:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices standards are
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
important civil rights are
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
important currently it's not something
 
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
that's required uh by the higher
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
education commission or by the
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
legislature when uh when recommending uh
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
the approval of an Institute of of
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
higher education for degree granting
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
Authority in the state civil rights are
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
important and anti-discrimination is
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
important we hear that from all of us we
 
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
hear that it's not a partisan issue
 
01:18:25.149 --> 01:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh but it's not something that's
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
currently contained in in the statute so
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
these are the three things this bill
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
puts in making sure that we're 501c3
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofit make sure that we comply with
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
the federal Higher Education Act and
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
number three that all applicable federal
 
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
and state anti-discrimination laws are
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
followed all before the higher education
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
commission can recommend a u uh a new
 
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
College to do business in the state and
 
01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
have degree granting Authority um and
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
and there's also some rationale behind
 
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
behind these three not not that we need
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
it beyond what uh what are clearly
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
priorities uh that we that we all share
 
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
in the state but um but you know based
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
on you know Common trends that we've
 
01:19:15.629 --> 01:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
seen in other states that uh that do
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
have um uh
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
for-profit uh colleges and uh and of
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
course the very very few
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities um that do not
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
follow the federal Higher Education Act
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
um for civil rights protections but
 
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
common trends that that we see in other
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
states that uh that do um uh have these
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
colleges operating in their states high
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
cost and debt burden debt burden with
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
students uh particularly a heavy
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
Reliance on uh on student loans when
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
attending for-profit colleges low
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
graduation rates compared to public and
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
for-profit institutions so low
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
graduation rates aren't things that are
 
01:19:57.149 --> 01:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
good for our students they're not
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
they're not it's not something that's
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
good for our economy it's not something
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's good for for our Workforce or um
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
or or degree attainment so uh so looking
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
out to avoid that Pitfall um Quality
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
concerns uh lack of accreditation and uh
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
We've SE other states have seen that
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
that the the accreditation standards for
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
some colleges particularly for-profit
 
01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.430 align:start position:0%
some colleges particularly for-profit
colleges

01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh may be uh may be lacking or that
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
these colleges because they have
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
for-profit motivations uh limit
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
resources for students so not good
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
things particularly uh in light of you
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
know a lot of the testimony we've be
 
01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
been hearing on other bills and um and
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
then I guess finally aggressive
 
01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
marketing tactics that uh that some
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
Institutes of higher education are
 
01:20:47.629 --> 01:20:47.639 align:start position:0%
employing and uh having sort of
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
deceptive marketing schemes that make uh
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
prospective students feel that they're
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
going to be able to to get a job quick
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
get rich quick something like that uh
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
without really having to put the time
 
01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
into it so so you know I'm sure there's
 
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
exceptions to every rule but um but
 
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
these are the trends that we're seeing
 
01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
these are the the you know sort of the
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
the standards that I think are important
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
to all of us and U and all 14536 to do
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
is set some sort of quality at deck for
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
um for the higher education to uh to to
 
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
work from when recommending um
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
Institutes of higher education have
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
degree granting Authority within the
 
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
state with that I'll happy to take some
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much I I'd like
 
01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
to ask a question just for clarification
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
here uh when I'm looking at the bill
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
analysis on the front page it's saying
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
the higher education
 
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
commission uh will be granting Authority
 
01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
actually the approve uh to be organized
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
as nonprofit
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
organizations and as I see nonprofit
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
organizations rather
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
than profit going out to
 
01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
investors on the other side of the coin
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
the profit or the balance sheet if there
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
is any Revenue that's in in beyond their
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
operating needs it plows back into the
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
organization uh the university how's
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
this going to impact a uh a for-profit
 
01:22:21.629 --> 01:22:21.639 align:start position:0%
such as SN well for-profit SN is not a
 
01:22:21.639 --> 01:22:23.350 align:start position:0%
such as SN well for-profit SN is not a
for-profit

01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
well it it's it's a nonprofit I don't
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
believe that's not what they're saying
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
on the web I don't believe we have any
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
for-profit Institutes of higher
 
01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
education in New
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean for-profit or I mean
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
there are there are some you know
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
nationally out there I don't believe sou
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know if somebody can look it up
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh quickly on this I don't believe
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire University is a
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.669 align:start position:0%
 
nonprofit

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:01.719 align:start position:0%
I no yeah um but that's why I say
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
clarification yeah I need clarification
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no I I I and I could be wrong
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
on that but uh but my understanding is
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does not have have
 
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
any instit higher education institutions
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
with degree granting Authority that are
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
for-profit institutions
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.679 --> 01:23:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
toser

01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
toser
 
01:23:38.159 --> 01:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
toser
right

01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
correct further questions represent mil
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you m thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
you representative luno for bringing
 
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
this forward I think in the 12 years
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
I've been on this committee we may have
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
had maybe three or four uh issues come
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
before this committee so could you for
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
the for you for the edification of the
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee could you outline exactly the
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
role that the higher education
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
commission plays in receiving
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
applications and what's the process of
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
it to ultimately come before the uh
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
legislature so thank you very much for
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
the question it's it's been a little bit
 
01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
time since I think we've had the higher
 
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
education uh commission here um this
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
committee actually did um did approve uh
 
01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
an organization down in Nashua u a u a a
 
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
a a private
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofit uh Aviation management I
 
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
believe it was an aviation management
 
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
company and um and the higher education
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
commission does look at the um the
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
ability for that organization to serve
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
its students meet the students needs uh
 
01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.390 align:start position:0%
its students meet the students needs uh
sustainability

01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
sustainability
 
01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.310 align:start position:0%
sustainability
accreditation

01:24:59.310 --> 01:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
accreditation
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure there are several other
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
factors uh involved in that there's um
 
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
there's there are uh several people that
 
01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh that are on the higher education
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
commission who uh who we've all seen in
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
this committee uh whether they're
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
testifying on those uh bills uh for
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
higher education or they may be
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
testifying on other bills but these
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
people have a lot lot of experience
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
they've been um you know former
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
chancellors of um of community college
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
system uh former uh College presidents
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh within the um the university system
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
and the community college system so so
 
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
so I think the higher education
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
commission does have have uh good good
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
internal standards that they uh that
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
they look for but uh but as far as I can
 
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
tell based on on the law set forth in 2
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
92h uh which which provides the
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
barebones criteria for rec for approval
 
01:26:01.109 --> 01:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
of degree granting Authority the
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
legislature does not set a floor a
 
01:26:07.109 --> 01:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
statutory floor for this and um and
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
adding these these three areas being a
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
nonprofit combin uh complying with the
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
Higher Education Act and complying with
 
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
federal and state uh applicable federal
 
01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
and state um anti-discrimination laws
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
would uh would be a reasonable uh hard
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
deck to uh for the legislature to set
 
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
further questions representa
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you just in your response
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
to uh SN um it says SN is a nonprofit
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
501c3 institution and according to the
 
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
National Center for educational
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
statistics students who pursue their
 
01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree at private nonprofit
 
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
institutions experience much higher
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
graduation rates than their counterparts
 
01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
at for profit schools
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
so the concern that I did have have on
 
01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
that is the analysis says to be
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
organized as a nonprofit organization
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
the analysis doesn't mention any of the
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
501c3 at all the analysis is often times
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
seen as an intent and the intent here
 
01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
would be nonprofit
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
organization well it but the the the
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill does require I get it the title
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
though I'm I'm speaking to the analysis
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
on the bill I think it's consistent
 
01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
no I'm not gonna no no no no that's yeah
 
01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:22.840 align:start position:0%

01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
question if I was uh
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
skilled as a
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
welder and I wanted to create a welding
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh school vocational welding school for
 
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
a profit uh and have some of the other
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
academic pieces to go with it to meet a
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
two-year associates degree uh in in

represent Woodcock um I think you've
 
01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
conflated a couple of things here though
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
I mean there are a lot of
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
for-profit uh occupational educational
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
um institutions they're not they're not
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
Institutes of higher education with

01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
you know I think you use the term
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
vocational uh vocational occupational
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
skills that that have value in the uh in
 
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
the marketplace but they're not
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily Associates degrees or

01:29:34.109 --> 01:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
you know whatever these these um
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
occupations that require professional
 
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
lure uh in New Hampshire th this doesn't
 
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this does not
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
get in the way of any of that and I
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want I don't think any of us
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
would want it to thank you thank you
 
01:29:48.669 --> 01:29:48.679 align:start position:0%
chairman further questions from the
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:53.109 align:start position:0%
committee represent
Ford

01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
Ford
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question having served on
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
several of those kinds of decision
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
groups that you're talking
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
about I don't ever
 
01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
recall that the issue of profitability
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
Enterprise was a concern in the
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
discussion it was always and almost
 
01:30:20.189 --> 01:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
totally focused on how the Integrity of
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
the Enterprise was Main
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
mained and I just wonder if you're
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit asking a question or wondering
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
whether it can
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
be a program of
 
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
Integrity if it's makes a profit and I'm
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
I fully make the connection you seem to
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
be making yeah no thank you thank you
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
very much for the for the question
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative Ford and and and you know
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
I've spent a lot of time in businesses
 
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
I've I've founded a business it was not
 
01:30:59.229 --> 01:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit business it was a for-profit
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
business and um and
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
and and there there is a difference in
 
01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
the between the for-profit world and the
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit world I think when
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner was was reading
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
from the I think the Southern New
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the the snhu uh website where
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
it talked about how some of those differ
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
is um manifest when it comes to and I
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't want I I I don't want to use the
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
word integrity but I want to use I I
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
want to do you know doing the best for
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
its students as opposed to doing the
 
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
best for its shareholders and and and
 
01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
you know I think in in higher education
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
it's imperative that um that that are
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities that have
 
01:31:48.109 --> 01:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
degree granting Authority that come
 
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
before the Department of Education for
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
higher education uh commission approval
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
and come before uh this esteemed um body
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
that um that they that they put the
 
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
interests of students first and the only
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
way you you you you can be assured of
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
that is um is is is by being a nonprofit
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
um uh organization and um and even then
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
I suppose that could be a challenge but
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
um uh but you know the the the the
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
national trends that have been seen with
 
01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.830 align:start position:0%
national trends that have been seen with
with

01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
for-profit uh uh colleges and
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
universities are like what represented
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
of Tanner read from the Southern New
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University uh website that uh
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
that um that you know the delivery of
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
services or necessary services for
 
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
students can be underresourced resources
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
for students can be more scarce and um
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
and you know I think New Hampshire is a
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
small state and um and and
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh we I don't think I I I think New
 
01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:01.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is very well served by its um
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
by the um the the nonprofit colleges and
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
universities that we have and and uh and
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
especially well served by our public um
 
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities uh across the
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
state and uh and I'd like to see New
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire establish that hard deck for
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
minimum qualification
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
to uh to so that we continue to see that
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
future thank you Mr chair as a followup
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
to representative Ford's question uh
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that one of the key things
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
that the higher education commission
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
looks at when they're looking at a new
 
01:33:45.149 --> 01:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
institution is aurity bond to make sure
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal nature of that
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
institution is viable so that should
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
they happen to go out of business that
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
the students do not suffer as a result
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
of that and that charity Bond basically
 
01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity for students to
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed if in fact uh the that
 
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
institution does cease to exist isn't
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
that true so so thanks I I I think I
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
think that is one of the things that the
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
higher education commission looks at but
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'm certain that is one of the things
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
that we do have in statute
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
for these vocational occupational
 
01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
Training centers uh to make sure that uh
 
01:34:33.149 --> 01:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
that they have aurity bond in place so
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
we do have um um some student
 
01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
Protections in place for vocational
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
occupational you know Professional
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
Licensing training organizations but we
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
don't have we don't have the floor in
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
place when it comes to uh Institutes of
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
higher ed that have granting Authority
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
further questions represent
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
LE in order
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
for a business a for-profit business to
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
stay in business they have to make their
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
customers happy otherwise their
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
customers wouldn't use them so I'm
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
wondering why
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that a
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
for-profit uh degree granting Institute
 
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't also have to do
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
that so so thanks I'm not suggesting
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
that that that that a for-profit
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
business can operate without customers
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
it certainly can't and to have customers
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
clearly they've got to be uh
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh there there's got to be something
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
about the product that's being delivered
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's important for the customers but
 
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to leave it alone on that
 
01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
because I think in the for-profit world
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
you see a lot of um things there's
 
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
certainly some for-profit companies that
 
01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
are in the news right now um that are
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
very important for-profit companies that
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
that are being criticized maybe for
 
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
putting profits above above safety and
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
um and you know
 
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
I again the for-profit world and the
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit world are very different and
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh from at least the information
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
that that I've been able to see and I
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
think the information that that folks
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
around the the in on the committee have
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
been able to see New Hampshire's
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities are nonprofit
 
01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and just looking to to make sure
 
01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
that we're um we're providing that that
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
sort of emphasis on on um on on student
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
focus and students first uh going
 
01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
forward when you were looking and
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
signing this bill did you ask the
 
01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
question of the either University system
 
01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
or the community college system if
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
they're accepting cours workk skill work
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
that a students transferring or wanting
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
to bring in from a nonprofit or for a
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization whether they're
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
getting credit for this from the
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
University system I did not ask that
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
question but it's a very good question
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
leus moving on to another of the three
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
parts I'm wondering which accreditation
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
for-profit uh institutions not have that
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofit institutions do
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
have I'm wondering why you put that in
 
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
there why why putting nonprofit in there
 
01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
no why you put
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
um you made a
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
comment about standards and
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
accreditation standards earlier and I'm
 
01:37:50.719 --> 01:37:51.350 align:start position:0%
accreditation standards earlier and I'm
wondering

01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.589 align:start position:0%

um are there accreditation standards

01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
for-profit universities don't get that
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
that uh nonprofit one yeah there there
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
may be I don't I don't have an easy
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
answer to that I mean obviously um uh
 
01:38:16.589 --> 01:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
Nei I think is a is a is a common um uh
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh accreditation that that are that that
 
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities have in uh in
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
the New England area I I I don't know if
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
there are for-profit organizations that
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
that have accreditation from Nei or
 
01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
whether they can or can't get get those
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
accreditations but I'm sure there are
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
accreditation authorities for um for for

Hopkinson in the town of both uh in
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
concept Mr uh chair this is a very
 
01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:41.750 align:start position:0%
concept Mr uh chair this is a very
simple

01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
Bill uh and uh every two years the state
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
creates a
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
budget and in that budget it alloc Ates
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
how much money should go to each program
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
and this program basically this bill
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
basically says that the education
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts funding should be held
 
01:50:04.350 --> 01:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
to whatever the budgeted amount is that
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
the uh budget committee and the budget
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
process establishes I have handed out to
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
you a um information that was received
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
by the LBA uh from OS and you can see in
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
the three years of the uh phas what the
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
budget amount was and what the expended
 
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
amount was and you can see that in each
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
each of the years it has gone over what
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
the budgeted amount has been and this
 
01:50:33.629 --> 01:50:33.639 align:start position:0%
bill would basically limit the amount of
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
EFA grants to uh uh parents to that
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
budgeted amount that's basically what
 
01:50:43.069 --> 01:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
the bill is thank you thank you are
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
there any questions of represent mil
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock thank you chairman
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
chairman Milo thank you uh question
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
question what
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
happens uh in actuality um when a a line
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
item like this goes over three four8
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
million over the budget account what
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
happens I have no
 
01:51:09.069 --> 01:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
idea well thank you okay represent
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli did you have a question I S
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
your hand up uh yeah thank you
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
um if the uh the budget amount is
 
01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.589 align:start position:0%
um if the uh the budget amount is
reached

01:51:20.589 --> 01:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
reached
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
um what happens with the uh subsequent
 
01:51:29.069 --> 01:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
students who might um be uh applying and
 
01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
who qualify for an account it would see
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that one
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli but it would
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
seem to me that once the uh budget has
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
been reached that there should be there
 
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
could be a warrant that could be issued
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh to the fiscal committee to expend
 
01:51:44.910 --> 01:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
that if they wanted to do that but right
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
now that's not
 
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
available thank you representative Damon
 
01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:52.350 align:start position:0%
available thank you representative Damon
thank

01:51:52.350 --> 01:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
you are do you have any information
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
on what
 
01:52:02.189 --> 01:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
happens or how often other line
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
item large uh
 
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
programs sorry I'm not asking this a
 
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
very organized way trying to get
 
01:52:12.669 --> 01:52:12.679 align:start position:0%
information on whether there's other
 
01:52:15.149 --> 01:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
programs that overspend the budget and
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
what happens with that I I don't know
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
that specifically but I do know that
 
01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
there's the fiscal committee is
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for basically administering
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
the budget in between the two once the
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
budget is adopted then they're
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
responsible for its imp implementation
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
leus if a number of school AED children
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
move into the state of New
 
01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:44.550 align:start position:0%
move into the state of New
Hampshire

01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
and that would then increase the
 
01:52:51.390 --> 01:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
spending for the state amount of the
 
01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid what happens
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
then now I mean now but all that comes
 
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
out of the trust fund so why would it be
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
different for EFA students coming in as
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to other student because an
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
annually there's a a it's it lags a year
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
behind annually there's a note that the
 
01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
that the the uh Department of Education
 
01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
comes up with with what the amount is
 
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
and this as we know this year it's like
 
01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.310 align:start position:0%
and this as we know this year it's like
51

01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
51
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
4150 and it's allocated based upon what
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
those are and and and if the budget goes
 
01:53:30.589 --> 01:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
typically in the past when the trust
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
fund needs more money it comes out of
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
the general fund and there's a process
 
01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
to get that right now there's no process
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
here there's no oversight here at least
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
to my understanding on how that money
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
once you reach that budget amount what
 
01:53:48.069 --> 01:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
what happens to in this case for example
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh in 2023 the 147 versus the 3.3
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
million I have no idea what the process
 
01:53:58.069 --> 01:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
is for that 14,000 they ultimately have
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
been allocated my point is is that once
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's established that it should be it
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
should follow the same process that any
 
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
other program would be with some
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
oversight as relates to what the
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
allocations would be for a particular
 
01:54:13.149 --> 01:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal year thank you thank you further
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee representa
 
01:54:18.270 --> 01:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you aren't there some funds
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
like um the special ed or catastrophic
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
Aid fund that has a budget and then uh
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
when schools submit their their bills
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
for that if if um the funding goes over
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
the budgeted amount it's decreased on a
 
01:54:37.629 --> 01:54:37.639 align:start position:0%
pro-rated basis to each school so that
 
01:54:39.149 --> 01:54:39.159 align:start position:0%
like in New Hampshire right now I
 
01:54:42.069 --> 01:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
believe it's schools only get about 51%
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for their special ed cost
 
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding yes just just to
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
correct that of the budgeted money for
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
the catastrophic Aid the the it's been
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
PR rated to 89% of that state obligation
 
01:54:59.950 --> 01:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about the whole special
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
education gamut of costs I'm talking
 
01:55:05.069 --> 01:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
about what has been appropriate for that
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
particular as that Grant area and it's
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
pro rated down to 89% some years it's
 
01:55:14.189 --> 01:55:14.199 align:start position:0%
been 100% other years I can remember was
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
69% you're welcome if I if I might add
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
to that one one of the I guess one of
 
01:55:20.109 --> 01:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
the concerns I do have
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
is a kind of a Cavalier attitude about
 
01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.149 align:start position:0%
is a kind of a Cavalier attitude about
this

01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
program uh when we uh dealt with this
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
issue last Thursday and um we passed the
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
500% of poverty level I was somewhat uh
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
shocked uh when it was waved any any
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal application of what that would
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
cost it just waved so let the Senate do
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe that's the way it
 
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
should be do business
 
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
here further questions represented
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
D thank you Mr chair thank you take
 
01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:54.069 align:start position:0%
D thank you Mr chair thank you take
another

01:55:54.069 --> 01:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:55:59.470 --> 01:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
question I would like to hear your help
 
01:56:01.229 --> 01:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
me understand
 
01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
please the fiscal note does not seem to
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
me to correspond to the language of the
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
bill in that the bill line 12 into
 
01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
13 specifically says not exceed
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
$1,800,000 for fiscal year 2024 and then
 
01:56:21.790 --> 01:56:21.800 align:start position:0%
talks about subsequent fiscal years and
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note they've somehow concluded
 
01:56:28.109 --> 01:56:28.119 align:start position:0%
that you could interpret the
 
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
bill to double that amount of
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
dollars well TP I I think makes sense
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
yeah if I may I'm not a budget expert by
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
any means but my sense is that that's
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
what what was budgeted for each each of
 
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal years that's where that's
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
where the if you look down at the
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom of the fiscal note
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
where it has the 39 the
 
01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
39651 that's a combination of what was
 
01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
budget in one year and what was budget
 
01:56:59.470 --> 01:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
in the second year that's how I that's
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
those dollars are budgeted for the bium
 
01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
yeah for the bani not each year for the
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
bani if you I 30 plus 30 plus million
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
but that's not what it says it says in
 
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
2025 it doesn't seem like that's what
 
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
the bill says but it that if it if you
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
read that no it says it could be
 
01:57:24.239 --> 01:57:25.750 align:start position:0%
read that no it says it could be
interpreted

01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes and so it's language which is not
 
01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.910 align:start position:0%
yes and so it's language which is not
really

01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:57:34.510 --> 01:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
clear further questions of represent
 
01:57:36.910 --> 01:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you very
 
01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
Trumble morning
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
good morning there you go start over
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and committee
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
members um I support this bill from
 
01:57:58.350 --> 01:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
representative Miler uh for a couple of
 
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
reasons and this a lot of this will be
 
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
similar to what we talked about under
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
the other bill this morning about the
 
01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.510 align:start position:0%
the other bill this morning about the
annual

01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
annual
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility first the EFA program is a
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
discretionary program and I made this
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
point earlier but I do want to stress it
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
again there's no constitutional mandate
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
that efas exist like there is a
 
01:58:19.149 --> 01:58:19.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandate that we must fund
 
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools that's directly from
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
our Constitution and from The Claremont
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
case so secondly I would say that means
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
that this program should be treated like
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
every other discretionary program in the
 
01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
state budget if you have a
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandate to spend on
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
something then maybe you have a blank
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
check because you have to spend on it
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
you have no choice we don't have to
 
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
spend on efas therefore it should be
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
treated like other discretionary
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
programs for instance um invest New
 
01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in an affordable housing
 
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
program they will finance a fixed number
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
of units they're spending tens of
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars we know we need way
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
more than they're funding for that
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
program but they've picked an amount
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
that they're going to spend the
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire gets
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
a certain amount they got a certain
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
amount to fix Spalding Hall but the
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
universities are constantly saying they
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
need more money but we don't give it to
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
them we give them a certain amount they
 
01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
have to stay within that budget the
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
division of Developmental Services gets
 
01:59:18.990 --> 01:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of money and the state
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
is been party to numerous lawsuits about
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
waiting lists but they get a certain
 
01:59:24.750 --> 01:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
amount of money that they can spend
 
01:59:26.910 --> 01:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
School building Aid has I was listening
 
01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
to a hearing last week on that they have
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
a competitive system for applications
 
01:59:32.669 --> 01:59:32.679 align:start position:0%
they don't Grant and pay immediately
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
everyone you they have to go through a
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
process so I think the EFA should be
 
01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
treated like every other discretionary
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
program and get a certain amount of
 
01:59:45.629 --> 01:59:45.639 align:start position:0%
money the next thing I want to talk
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
about is the net cost of public schools
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
this question came up from
 
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative leus earlier this morning
 
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to just walk through it
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
again there have been claims that the
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
EFA program saves schools money saves
 
01:59:59.950 --> 01:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
Town's money saves Public Schools money
 
02:00:02.189 --> 02:00:02.199 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really save money it's a
 
02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
theoretical savings that sure it costs
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
an average of 20,000 to educate each
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
student but if you take two students out
 
02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
of every public school and they go over
 
02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
to a private school through the EFA
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
program that school doesn't save money
 
02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
and again I'll just walk through some of
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
the statistics from earlier in the con
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
decision teachers are 66% of the budget
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
losing two students in a middle school
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
in your big town is not going to lead to
 
02:00:29.629 --> 02:00:29.639 align:start position:0%
any teachers being fired the other
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
professionals guidance Library
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
custodians principles 14% you're not
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
going to fire a custodian if two
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
children leave your public school and
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
join an EFA the facilities are 15% you
 
02:00:42.910 --> 02:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
still have to fix the roof you still
 
02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
have to heat and put the lights on and
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
the only difference is the instructional
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
material and Technology that's 4% or 4
 
02:00:54.189 --> 02:00:54.199 align:start position:0%
$400 so the EFA program does not in the
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
real world save money and if people want
 
02:00:58.750 --> 02:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
to make that claim I would just say
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
present some data to the public you now
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
have several years of this program let
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
the institutions who do nonprofit
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
research whether it's the center for
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
Budget uh policy Mr Klein's group or
 
02:01:11.069 --> 02:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
it's reaching higher New Hampshire the
 
02:01:13.470 --> 02:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school funding project
 
02:01:16.350 --> 02:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
give them some data that you've track 10
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
schools the impact of vfas on them and
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
show whether or not there is an actual
 
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
savings or better yet bring in six
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
superintendant they it's budget season
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
they have their data ask them the simple
 
02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
question your school we know lost two
 
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
students through efas what was the
 
02:01:34.069 --> 02:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
impact on your budget and I bet you
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you none if anything
 
02:01:38.069 --> 02:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
negative because they lose some of that
 
02:01:40.069 --> 02:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
adequacy money so I think there needs to
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
be an understanding that this program
 
02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
and the public school funding programs
 
02:01:45.870 --> 02:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
interact with each other at a
 
02:01:49.149 --> 02:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
fundamental Financial level if you take
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
more money and put it into this program
 
02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's not available for the public
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
schools and the conv Val decisions
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
coming down the highway you're going to
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
need to come up with $500 million more
 
02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
money this certainly means that we
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
should not be spending on it with
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
unlimited funds on a program giving it a
 
02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
blank check uh unless you can and last
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
week the question was how would it be
 
02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
implemented I thought representative
 
02:02:12.510 --> 02:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
myor was correct send it back to the
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
finance committee and have another
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
debate do we want to spend more money or
 
02:02:18.669 --> 02:02:18.679 align:start position:0%
you could do a declining benefit system
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
public Housing Works that way as your
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
income Rises and you get closer to the
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility cut off point your benefit
 
02:02:29.229 --> 02:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
drops so maybe if you say we only have1
 
02:02:31.229 --> 02:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
million what we'll do is adopt the
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
declining benefit model so that if
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
you're at the poverty level you get the
 
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
$5,000 as you go further up and income
 
02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
towards that 500% Mark you get a
 
02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
declining benefit that would be one way
 
02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
to allow every child who's in the
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
program to stay in the program and
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
families would know where they stand
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
that as they earn more money they have
 
02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
to pay a little bit more themselves and
 
02:02:52.510 --> 02:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
get a little less from the state there's
 
02:02:53.950 --> 02:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
certainly ways it could be done but the
 
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
basic point I wanted to make was if it's
 
02:02:58.069 --> 02:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required you have to
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
pay it if it's not constitutionally
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
required there's no reason to put a
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
blank check it should be treated like
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
every other discretionary program like
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
Housing Programs developmental services
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
and the university system so thank you
 
02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
02:03:16.069 --> 02:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
Trumble not seeing any thank you very
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr chairman and I have no
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
other pin cards on this bill so we are
 
02:03:20.719 --> 02:03:26.589 align:start position:0%
other pin cards on this bill so we are
closed

02:03:26.589 --> 02:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
1512 and uh get ready to go into HB
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
1108 1108 uh relative to establishing a
 
02:03:37.149 --> 02:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
committee to study the role of colleges
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
and universities in contributing to the
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:49.870 align:start position:0%
 
crisis

02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
02:03:49.880 --> 02:04:00.950 align:start position:0%
crisis
yeah

02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
right good morning again Mr chair and
 
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
beler for the record representative
 
02:04:13.229 --> 02:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
beler Carol District 4 out of
 
02:04:16.589 --> 02:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
Wakefield so this bill establishes seeks
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
to establish a committee
 
02:04:22.549 --> 02:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
to look at the student loan crisis and I
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't think any argument can be made
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
against the fact that we do in fact have
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
a student loan crisis in this
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
country this problem is substantially
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
responsible for the number of Young
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
Americans who are having difficulty
 
02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing homes starting families and
 
02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
moving on in their
 
02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
careers as such this problem not only
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
affects the borrowers this problem
 
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
generally we must take up this issue
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
with the seriousness that it
 
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
deserves we must look for Solutions and
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
we must look to see what can be done to
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
curtail the issue going
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
forward there are very many arguments
 
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
from very many different people
 
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
identifying possible causal factors and
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
attributing responsibility for the
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
crisis I can't address all those right
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
now but what I can say
 
02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
unequivocally is one party can be ruled
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
out entirely as having any
 
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this situation and
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayer it's not the taxpayer's fault
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
that students signed on and borrowed
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
large sums of money sometimes hundreds
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars it's not it's
 
02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
not the taxpayer's fault that government
 
02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
took over and began backing student
 
02:05:48.910 --> 02:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
loans which appears to have uh
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
immediately preceded the skyrocketing of
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
costs and expansion of non-teaching
 
02:05:56.430 --> 02:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
positions it's not the taxpayer's fault
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
that colleges and universities lobbied
 
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
the government to back student
 
02:06:04.030 --> 02:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
loans and proceeded to abgate their
 
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to the students by
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
increasing costs dramatically and hiring
 
02:06:14.549 --> 02:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
more and more non-teaching
 
02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
personnel as such I don't think it makes
 
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense that we look for foremost
 
02:06:23.069 --> 02:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayer to solve this problem
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
through either direct taxation or
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
inflation which robs their Savings of
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
its value
 
02:06:31.629 --> 02:06:31.639 align:start position:0%
indirectly I think we should instead be
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the government and at the
 
02:06:34.990 --> 02:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities themselves to
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
determine what if any responsibility
 
02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:40.679 align:start position:0%
they hold for this
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
crisis of course I believe there is more
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
than reasonable
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
articulable uh suspicion to carry out an
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
investigation into this matter and to
 
02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:51.910 align:start position:0%
investigation into this matter and to
make

02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations on any findings that can
 
02:06:57.750 --> 02:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
be come up with if we're serious about
 
02:06:59.310 --> 02:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
tackling the student loan crisis we need
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
to investigate its Origins and identify
 
02:07:03.709 --> 02:07:03.719 align:start position:0%
the responsible
 
02:07:07.069 --> 02:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
parties so that we can solve the problem
 
02:07:09.549 --> 02:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
without implicating parties that had no
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
role in creating the problem in the
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
first place thank you I will take
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much representa
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you uh I'm just
 
02:07:23.149 --> 02:07:23.159 align:start position:0%
unclear as to how you expect um five
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
house members and one Senator to come up
 
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
with this information I just did a quick
 
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
search last night on the internet um
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
there are plenty plenty of studies out
 
02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
there student loan debt crisis from the
 
02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
Education data initiative causes and
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
solutions to the student debt crisis
 
02:07:45.149 --> 02:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
from the Annie Casey Foundation um
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
America's student loan crisis from the
 
02:07:50.589 --> 02:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
credit abuse resistance educ ucation um
 
02:07:53.069 --> 02:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
student debt analysis higher ed funding
 
02:07:55.629 --> 02:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
data from Pew charitable trust and I
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
could go on I've got a whole page long
 
02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
list here with just a few minutes search
 
02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
on the internet plenty of people are
 
02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
looking at this and identifying the
 
02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
problems so what more can a group of
 
02:08:09.069 --> 02:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
five representatives and one Senators
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
bring to this issue thank you that's a
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
very good question there is a lot of
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
data out there there's a lot of private
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
parties looking at this putting forward
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
good reports but what they can't do
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
is they can't issue legislative findings
 
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
or potential legislation to try to
 
02:08:25.549 --> 02:08:25.559 align:start position:0%
address the problem and I think that's
 
02:08:27.950 --> 02:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
where it falls to us as a body to be
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
able to look at this and see not just
 
02:08:31.709 --> 02:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
not just say well this part party
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
appears to have from responsibility but
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
is there legislation we can move forward
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
to address the problem or at the very
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
least to Cil it going
 
02:08:42.750 --> 02:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
forward further

and Lynn could you give us a brief
 
03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:25.359 align:start position:0%

03:47:33.710 --> 03:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:37.149 --> 03:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
you absolutely thank you Mr chair um
 
03:47:39.469 --> 03:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um as I uh
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
indicated during my testimony basically
 
03:47:45.389 --> 03:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
this is this bill is designed to uh
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
ensure that um students student
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
organizations and faculty members uh
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
that are facing
 
03:47:56.349 --> 03:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action uh have their due
 
03:48:01.389 --> 03:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
process rights uh protected um and and I
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
think I I kind of you know just went
 
03:48:06.870 --> 03:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
went into a fair fair amount of detail
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
when I first testified um there were
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
questions raised and I know I I worked
 
03:48:14.429 --> 03:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
with representative beler um about
 
03:48:15.870 --> 03:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
issues that were raised and I know one
 
03:48:18.710 --> 03:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
of the one of the uh significant issues
 
03:48:22.790 --> 03:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
that was were was raised by um members
 
03:48:24.990 --> 03:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
of the of the community college system
 
03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I think the university system was
 
03:48:28.510 --> 03:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill had originally
 
03:48:31.590 --> 03:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
been drafted it had I had also had it
 
03:48:35.070 --> 03:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
apply to something less than a
 
03:48:37.469 --> 03:48:37.479 align:start position:0%
suspension um for example a rep I think
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
it said reprimand or uh even something
 
03:48:41.550 --> 03:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
less than that and I think there was a
 
03:48:43.950 --> 03:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
concern expressed about that maybe goes
 
03:48:47.149 --> 03:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
too far they have you know there I think
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
there was uh representative luno you may
 
03:48:50.070 --> 03:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
have raised the issue of you know
 
03:48:52.229 --> 03:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
someone if a student is uh making too
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
much noise in the dormatory and and they
 
03:48:56.550 --> 03:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know they they basically tell him to
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
cut it out or give them some some the
 
03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
student some uh some very low level of
 
03:49:06.830 --> 03:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh of discipline does that St do we have
 
03:49:09.950 --> 03:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
to invoke all of the due process
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
rights um and I I you know I I still
 
03:49:16.389 --> 03:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
have some concern about that but
 
03:49:20.149 --> 03:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
I you know I'm I very much believe in
 
03:49:24.110 --> 03:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
compromising and I and uh this proposed
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
amendment takes out the it has to be at
 
03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
least a suspension um and so I you know
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
I I mean I certainly can can live with
 
03:49:35.070 --> 03:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
that I understand the concerns that are
 
03:49:38.990 --> 03:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
raised about not turning you know a mole
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
hill into a mountain so to speak uh
 
03:49:42.910 --> 03:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
where where there's very low levels of
 
03:49:45.030 --> 03:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
discipline so I can you know I can kind
 
03:49:48.670 --> 03:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
of live with that um uh and so that
 
03:49:49.950 --> 03:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's one of the big
 
03:49:52.990 --> 03:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
things that uh that is is proposed as a
 
03:49:55.510 --> 03:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
change in the amendment
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to to discuss I'm happy
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
to discuss the other changes that are it
 
03:50:02.910 --> 03:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like instead of a 30-foot tsun
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
tsunami we're going to have a one foot
 
03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
right right okay um uh do we have the we
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
we do have an amendment put forth here
 
03:50:15.630 --> 03:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
represent beler you're also a sponsor
 
03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%

03:50:24.510 --> 03:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:24.520 --> 03:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
1288

03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:37.349 --> 03:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:39.870 --> 03:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
0332 okay are there
 
03:50:41.349 --> 03:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
represent Bel you can come up to the
 
03:50:43.830 --> 03:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
table as well seeing that you are also a
 
03:50:45.790 --> 03:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
a sponsor on
 
03:50:48.910 --> 03:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
this are there any questions from the
 
03:50:51.469 --> 03:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
committee regarding the amendment is
 
03:50:53.229 --> 03:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
there anything represent beler that you
 
03:50:54.950 --> 03:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
feel that needs to be explained about
 
03:50:56.750 --> 03:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment that has not been said to
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
date sure if if you I will sure um so as
 
03:51:03.469 --> 03:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
uh as repent indicated we remove the
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
reprimand Port uh just because of the
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
issues that that could potentially
 
03:51:11.590 --> 03:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
create um we added an area surrounding
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
the idea of criminal allegations or
 
03:51:15.070 --> 03:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
allegations that could be of a criminal
 
03:51:18.429 --> 03:51:18.439 align:start position:0%
nature and we did that recognizing that
 
03:51:21.870 --> 03:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
our court system is in the business of
 
03:51:24.750 --> 03:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
Justice that's their primary goal and
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
role whereas in universities it's more
 
03:51:29.790 --> 03:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
of a secondary function so at the uh at
 
03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
the we added a definition but also at
 
03:51:34.590 --> 03:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
the end we added a clause that if there
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
is a criminal proceeding brought against
 
03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
a student then the uh University or
 
03:51:42.030 --> 03:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
college uh must hold off on their
 
03:51:43.590 --> 03:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings until the
 
03:51:45.750 --> 03:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
professional Justice is done but they
 
03:51:48.309 --> 03:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
can still take um disciplinary measures
 
03:51:50.349 --> 03:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
on a temporary basis until that point in
 
03:51:52.070 --> 03:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
time under the sort of presumption that
 
03:51:56.670 --> 03:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:59.510 --> 03:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
so there are questions on what was just
 
03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
stated who brings forth the the um the
 
03:52:07.149 --> 03:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
uh need for a criminal proceeding who
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
makes that allegation
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
well well I mean if that would be um
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
that would that would be prosecutorial
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
authorities you know the county attorney
 
03:52:18.269 --> 03:52:18.279 align:start position:0%
or the Attorney General it would have to
 
03:52:20.469 --> 03:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
be a prosecutorial Authority that would
 
03:52:22.870 --> 03:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
make the decision to prosecute you know
 
03:52:25.229 --> 03:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
the one other thing that um along the
 
03:52:26.510 --> 03:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
same line that I think is important to
 
03:52:28.910 --> 03:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
point out you'll notice that in the in
 
03:52:31.710 --> 03:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment in paragraph Roman numeral
 
03:52:34.990 --> 03:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
4 um there's a provision that was added
 
03:52:37.229 --> 03:52:37.239 align:start position:0%
um and this was based on my discussions
 
03:52:39.189 --> 03:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
with with between representative vure
 
03:52:44.710 --> 03:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
myself that says that if there's been an
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
adjudication by the by the student
 
03:52:50.830 --> 03:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
disciplinary procedures if there's been
 
03:52:50.840 --> 03:52:51.830 align:start position:0%
disciplinary procedures if there's been
a

03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:52:54.389 --> 03:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
determination that is not
 
03:52:58.469 --> 03:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
admissible in the criminal uh uh
 
03:53:00.990 --> 03:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding um and the and the reason for
 
03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:01.870 align:start position:0%
proceeding um and the and the reason for
that

03:53:01.870 --> 03:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:05.309 --> 03:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
is under the Rules of Evidence I wish I
 
03:53:07.070 --> 03:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
I I forgot to bring them with me but
 
03:53:09.269 --> 03:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
under the rules of evidence that apply
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
in court there are certain circumstances
 
03:53:16.590 --> 03:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
in which a determination by an
 
03:53:18.910 --> 03:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
administrative tribunal or some kind of
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
fact-f finding
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
tribunal can in some cases be admitted I
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
think if I recall correct I wish I had
 
03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
the rule in front of me but I think I
 
03:53:31.750 --> 03:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
think basically it can only be admitted
 
03:53:34.149 --> 03:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
against the government or so against the
 
03:53:36.389 --> 03:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
state in other words there might be
 
03:53:38.149 --> 03:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which let's say that
 
03:53:40.750 --> 03:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
where's a discipline lary proceeding in
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
the uh you know in the the school
 
03:53:47.349 --> 03:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceeding and the student
 
03:53:47.359 --> 03:53:48.389 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceeding and the student
was

03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:53:53.710 --> 03:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
found um not to have violated the um the
 
03:53:56.670 --> 03:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
the code or or uh yeah not not to have
 
03:53:58.229 --> 03:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
violated the student code just as an
 
03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
example um there might be circumstances
 
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
in which that
 
03:54:06.670 --> 03:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
finding would be admissible against the
 
03:54:08.710 --> 03:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
state in the criminal proceeding there
 
03:54:10.229 --> 03:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
might be I mean I suppose there could
 
03:54:13.149 --> 03:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
also be circumstances in which in which
 
03:54:17.269 --> 03:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
even a even a finding like a of that a
 
03:54:19.510 --> 03:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
victim had lied or something like that
 
03:54:22.149 --> 03:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
arguably could be admissible in a Crim
 
03:54:23.870 --> 03:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
in a criminal proceeding this is
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
designed to say no that's that that will
 
03:54:28.750 --> 03:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
not happen the criminal proceeding will
 
03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
the evidence the whatever the evidence
 
03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
might be you know that certainly can be
 
03:54:37.469 --> 03:54:37.479 align:start position:0%
can be admitted but the finding of the
 
03:54:39.870 --> 03:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
tribunal is not not is not to be
 
03:54:42.510 --> 03:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
admitted in the criminal proceeding um
 
03:54:46.070 --> 03:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
and that seemed to make that that seemed
 
03:54:49.149 --> 03:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
to me to make sense um and I think it
 
03:54:52.189 --> 03:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
representative belshire agreed
 
03:54:55.309 --> 03:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
so with this understanding perhaps it'
 
03:54:58.110 --> 03:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
be a a a good time if we don't have
 
03:55:00.070 --> 03:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
questions right now further we will have
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
questions but that we should have some
 
03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
of those that are here to speak
 
03:55:07.149 --> 03:55:07.159 align:start position:0%
regarding this to come forward and
 
03:55:09.750 --> 03:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
present their perspective
 
03:55:13.149 --> 03:55:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh and where we are on this um who'd
 
03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
like to be up
 
03:55:14.960 --> 03:55:17.309 align:start position:0%
like to be up
first

03:55:17.309 --> 03:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner glad to love to have the
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
agriculture Department here well I am
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:29.950 --> 03:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and for the record I am Sean
 
03:55:32.229 --> 03:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
Jasper not appearing as commissioner of
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture markets
 
03:55:37.469 --> 03:55:37.479 align:start position:0%
and food but H appearing as chapter
 
03:55:40.030 --> 03:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
advisor to the Alpha gamar fraternity
 
03:55:42.510 --> 03:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
which is the agricultural fraternity at
 
03:55:46.030 --> 03:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
UNH uh to which I have been advisor for
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
the past 36
 
03:55:52.149 --> 03:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
years um in my role as commissioner to
 
03:55:55.790 --> 03:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
just be transparent I also serve uh as a
 
03:55:58.590 --> 03:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
university system member of the the
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees and I have had many of
 
03:56:03.870 --> 03:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
these conversations of things that I'm
 
03:56:06.429 --> 03:56:06.439 align:start position:0%
going to share with you um with others
 
03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
over the years and really while there
 
03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
has been some progress
 
03:56:15.469 --> 03:56:15.479 align:start position:0%
made the thing about that is so much of
 
03:56:17.830 --> 03:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
it is dependent on who is in the
 
03:56:21.149 --> 03:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
office so things can EB and flow and I
 
03:56:23.030 --> 03:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
do think that there should be
 
03:56:27.149 --> 03:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
Protections in in legislation to
 
03:56:29.349 --> 03:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
protect the parties here and I'm going
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
to read you uh one paragraph from an
 
03:56:39.550 --> 03:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
email that I sent in uh on May 14th 2022
 
03:56:42.910 --> 03:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
which I think summarizes some of my
 
03:56:47.189 --> 03:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
concerns and this was to um the
 
03:56:50.349 --> 03:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
assistant or Greek advisor or now called
 
03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
fraternity and sorority life advisor and
 
03:56:55.950 --> 03:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
I said yesterday my intent was to try to
 
03:56:58.389 --> 03:56:58.399 align:start position:0%
ensure that AGR was provided with due
 
03:57:00.670 --> 03:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
process which includes my right to
 
03:57:02.229 --> 03:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
advise the president throughout the
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
process I also made a statement about my
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
lack lack of trust in the system I have
 
03:57:10.030 --> 03:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
been chapter advised for 34 years and
 
03:57:12.670 --> 03:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
during that time I have seen processes
 
03:57:14.590 --> 03:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
procedures and standards used that would
 
03:57:17.550 --> 03:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
never be allowed in our legal system to
 
03:57:20.229 --> 03:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
me it is not only wrong but Al also very
 
03:57:23.309 --> 03:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
sad in a university setting everything
 
03:57:24.950 --> 03:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
that is taught by the university should
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
be done according to the higher
 
03:57:29.309 --> 03:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
standards I hope that you would agree
 
03:57:31.030 --> 03:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
students on both sides of the process
 
03:57:33.550 --> 03:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
should be learning about how an ethical
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
judicial process works again I hope you
 
03:57:39.670 --> 03:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
agree sadly in the the several judicial
 
03:57:41.349 --> 03:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
processes that I have been part of over
 
03:57:43.510 --> 03:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
the years I've never come away with the
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
feeling that either of those objectives
 
03:57:48.149 --> 03:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
have been met even when I offered to
 
03:57:50.269 --> 03:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
work with the university on those issues
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
after our case was adjudicated I was
 
03:57:52.800 --> 03:57:54.110 align:start position:0%
after our case was adjudicated I was
ultimately

03:57:54.110 --> 03:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
03:57:56.910 --> 03:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
ignored and so that's why this bill
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
caught my eye it had not spoken to the
 
03:58:02.189 --> 03:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
sponsors before uh before I saw the
 
03:58:07.550 --> 03:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
hearing of this um this bill and so
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
things that have happened happened in
 
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
the process have been such as and this
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
was a number of years ago that the
 
03:58:16.349 --> 03:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
chapter was
 
03:58:19.349 --> 03:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
suspended our president was planning on
 
03:58:21.309 --> 03:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
meeting with the at that time was the
 
03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
Greek advisor went into that meeting and
 
03:58:28.510 --> 03:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
there was the dean of students who
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
handed him a letter of suspension there
 
03:58:34.990 --> 03:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
had been no contact no no opportunity to
 
03:58:38.550 --> 03:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
respond to what had gone on and in fact
 
03:58:40.269 --> 03:58:40.279 align:start position:0%
fact as we got into the process and we
 
03:58:43.550 --> 03:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
had to spend some $88,000 to defend the
 
03:58:46.510 --> 03:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
fraternity which ultimately it was not
 
03:58:48.149 --> 03:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
the fraternity that was really found
 
03:58:49.710 --> 03:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
responsible but two
 
03:58:52.870 --> 03:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
individual um individuals within the
 
03:58:52.880 --> 03:58:54.750 align:start position:0%
individual um individuals within the
fraternity

03:58:54.750 --> 03:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
fraternity
 
03:58:58.950 --> 03:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
um it found out that couple of th I
 
03:59:00.630 --> 03:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
think there were three who wanted to get
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
out of the housing situation at the
 
03:59:06.189 --> 03:59:06.199 align:start position:0%
fraternity went to to the Greek adviser
 
03:59:08.149 --> 03:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
to see how they could get out and what
 
03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
he was told is I can only help you if
 
03:59:14.590 --> 03:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
you give me dirt on
 
03:59:18.149 --> 03:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
AGR and then he became the complaint and
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
called the police ultimately there was
 
03:59:23.870 --> 03:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
nothing that the police found but it was
 
03:59:25.670 --> 03:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
a really ugly
 
03:59:28.750 --> 03:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
process I put unbelievable number of
 
03:59:30.870 --> 03:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
hours into that so that was one case
 
03:59:33.389 --> 03:59:33.399 align:start position:0%
that was a number of years ago the more
 
03:59:36.269 --> 03:59:36.279 align:start position:0%
recent one again was just if you look at
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
the the rules and IFC technically into
 
03:59:41.630 --> 03:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
fraternity council is technically an
 
03:59:44.110 --> 03:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
independent governing body in reality it
 
03:59:45.189 --> 03:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
it really
 
03:59:48.189 --> 03:59:48.199 align:start position:0%
isn't um we received a letter and this
 
03:59:50.670 --> 03:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
was simp a simple matter which didn't go
 
03:59:53.469 --> 03:59:53.479 align:start position:0%
any any place other than a loss of
 
03:59:55.750 --> 03:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
social privileges for a week and was
 
03:59:59.149 --> 03:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
settled informally but it was you look
 
04:00:01.550 --> 04:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
at this process and the chapter advisor
 
04:00:04.269 --> 04:00:04.279 align:start position:0%
is not allowed to participate you know
 
04:00:06.870 --> 04:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
you're putting these students into this
 
04:00:09.910 --> 04:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
situation where they're defending
 
04:00:12.349 --> 04:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
organization and they've probably never
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
gone through this again they're not only
 
04:00:18.149 --> 04:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
just facing a peer but um um the Greek
 
04:00:20.710 --> 04:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
advisor as well and it seems proper as
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
this bill points out to allow that that
 
04:00:27.630 --> 04:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
advisor to participate in the process
 
04:00:30.070 --> 04:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you another example which
 
04:00:32.790 --> 04:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
isn't so much perhaps on
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
point but the really shows what I've had
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
to go through
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
so during the the pandemic the
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
fraternity received notice from the
 
04:00:47.870 --> 04:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
University that HHS from the state
 
04:00:51.830 --> 04:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
wanted a list of the names of all of the
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
men living in the chapter house well
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
that seemed very strange to me so I went
 
04:00:58.389 --> 04:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
back and forth and I've got the email
 
04:01:00.830 --> 04:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
chain here I won't bore you with with
 
04:01:04.189 --> 04:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
that but ultimately I just kept getting
 
04:01:05.790 --> 04:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
well the state wants it the state wants
 
04:01:06.990 --> 04:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
it they don't want their medical
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
conditions they just want to know who's
 
04:01:10.349 --> 04:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
living there I said well to myself well
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's very strange the state doesn't go
 
04:01:14.990 --> 04:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
around asking who's living where now I
 
04:01:17.710 --> 04:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
had known for years the university had
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
been trying to get lists of who was
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
living in in the house that's up to the
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
individuals we don't share their living
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
situations with them ultimately after
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
being told yes this is what the state
 
04:01:32.110 --> 04:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
wants I have that in writing I contacted
 
04:01:34.349 --> 04:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
HHS I contacted the person who had been
 
04:01:37.630 --> 04:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with the university and was told
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
no we have not requested that
 
04:01:41.149 --> 04:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
information we don't have a database to
 
04:01:43.389 --> 04:01:43.399 align:start position:0%
keep that information in all we've said
 
04:01:46.510 --> 04:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
is if there is an an outbreak of covid
 
04:01:48.670 --> 04:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
among a significant number of people in
 
04:01:50.349 --> 04:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
a building we want to know who's living
 
04:01:53.030 --> 04:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
there which is is reasonable so hence I
 
04:01:57.070 --> 04:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
go back to even as a as a
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
trustee there's a lack of trust and
 
04:02:03.950 --> 04:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
there needs to be um a better system but
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
particularly on the judicial side there
 
04:02:09.750 --> 04:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
should be that due process that should
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
um exist and no matter how I have tried
 
04:02:13.469 --> 04:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
to deal with it over the
 
04:02:16.910 --> 04:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
years I have made little progress
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps some with the current
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
Administration and again I mean I I like
 
04:02:22.990 --> 04:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
the people who are all behind me from
 
04:02:25.269 --> 04:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
the University I'm not blaming any of
 
04:02:28.469 --> 04:02:28.479 align:start position:0%
them but it seems to be a system that
 
04:02:32.189 --> 04:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes controls itself and not the
 
04:02:34.269 --> 04:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
individuals controlling the system and
 
04:02:37.030 --> 04:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
depending on who are in those particular
 
04:02:39.149 --> 04:02:39.159 align:start position:0%
roles things can change very
 
04:02:41.189 --> 04:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
dramatically and so that's why I do
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
think this is very important I'd be glad
 
04:02:46.510 --> 04:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you um the
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
egg fraternity that's a separate
 
04:02:52.110 --> 04:02:52.120 align:start position:0%
Corporation right that is correct and
 
04:02:56.149 --> 04:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
are they living on campus or off campus
 
04:02:58.110 --> 04:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
all the fraternities are located off
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
campus and so therefore the uh
 
04:03:04.189 --> 04:03:04.199 align:start position:0%
controlled in terms of our housing
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
Arrangement who's who has the police
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
Authority that is Durham Police and not
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
the as police so if a complaint is made
 
04:03:17.149 --> 04:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
to Paul Dean chief of police down to u
 
04:03:19.389 --> 04:03:19.399 align:start position:0%
university system New
 
04:03:19.399 --> 04:03:21.269 align:start position:0%
university system New
Hampshire

04:03:21.269 --> 04:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
UNH who who responds is it the Durham
 
04:03:28.269 --> 04:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
Police Department the responds and how's
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
that work yes it is it is the Durham
 
04:03:32.830 --> 04:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
Police Department so he would no doubt
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
notify if there was a complaint that
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
came through campus police he would pass
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
that on to the you um to the Town police
 
04:03:43.750 --> 04:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
and we have a very good relationship uh
 
04:03:47.309 --> 04:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
with both um both departments and don't
 
04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
have any any issues and they haven't had
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
any issues with us this is more this
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
internal thing where in in some cases
 
04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
frankly there are people within the
 
04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
system looking for things for instance
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I've been arguing
 
04:04:10.469 --> 04:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
about for years is the university con
 
04:04:14.429 --> 04:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
considers a fraternity event anything
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
this is a short version the whole
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
language is here anything where if you
 
04:04:21.550 --> 04:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
looked at a number of people and and
 
04:04:23.670 --> 04:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
realized they were Greek you could say
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
hey that's a fraternity event no matter
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
if it was 5 10 or or whatever and I've
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
been trying to argue to say you know in
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
our case we have a chapter house that
 
04:04:36.149 --> 04:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
holds 24 members if we have 48 members
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
there that's you know
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
um the residents and a guest each um the
 
04:04:47.670 --> 04:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
university only allows registration on
 
04:04:47.680 --> 04:04:49.269 align:start position:0%
university only allows registration on
Thursday

04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
04:04:51.870 --> 04:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
um two nights you can register Thursday
 
04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
Friday or Saturday but it can't be a
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
Friday and Saturday together um but if
 
04:04:59.149 --> 04:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
they are aware of any number of people
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
together in the fraternity house they
 
04:05:02.990 --> 04:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
haven't bothered as if it's just the
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
guys hanging out but if they have any
 
04:05:06.910 --> 04:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
guests over then that's an unregistered
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
social event and we subject to um
 
04:05:11.550 --> 04:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action and I've said we
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
have the right to do that we're well
 
04:05:19.110 --> 04:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
under what is considered um a need for a
 
04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
um occupancy permit from the fire
 
04:05:24.110 --> 04:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
department and our Corporation has told
 
04:05:26.429 --> 04:05:26.439 align:start position:0%
the guys look as long as you stay under
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
50 we're fine with that we expect that
 
04:05:30.309 --> 04:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to have friends over and
 
04:05:32.750 --> 04:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
you may all have friends over but that's
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
not supported by the university rules
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
and then people will post pictures on on
 
04:05:41.790 --> 04:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
social media people have trolled for
 
04:05:44.070 --> 04:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
that we actually had a a
 
04:05:48.870 --> 04:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
situation um last last year where yep
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
they had a a party just some of the guys
 
04:05:52.349 --> 04:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
and their
 
04:05:54.429 --> 04:05:54.439 align:start position:0%
girlfriends at the end of the semester
 
04:05:56.189 --> 04:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
but it was after a period when socials
 
04:05:58.189 --> 04:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
were allowed I didn't consider that to
 
04:06:00.189 --> 04:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
be a social there were probably less
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
than 20 people participating and yet
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're somebody's trolling somebody's
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
reporting and then without knowing who
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
that person is is and this is these
 
04:06:12.349 --> 04:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
people don't have to come as Witnesses
 
04:06:13.870 --> 04:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have to tell us how they got
 
04:06:16.229 --> 04:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
the pictures or whatever you just make a
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
complaint and then um the disciplinary
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
action starts and we never find out you
 
04:06:25.149 --> 04:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in terms where due
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
process come in well there is no due
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
process in in that part of it um and
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's where I feel that you know as as
 
04:06:36.510 --> 04:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment to the bill perhaps the
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
bill itself talks about you know
 
04:06:41.229 --> 04:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
cross-examining Witnesses and talking to
 
04:06:43.149 --> 04:06:43.159 align:start position:0%
to people I think we have the right to
 
04:06:46.990 --> 04:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
know in due process who is making the
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
allegation and talking to them about
 
04:06:51.149 --> 04:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
that I feel I've always felt very
 
04:06:53.309 --> 04:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
strongly about that you can't should not
 
04:06:55.469 --> 04:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
just be going out there making
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
allegations and often because there's no
 
04:07:00.510 --> 04:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
other complaint it's really the
 
04:07:03.630 --> 04:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
university itself making the complaint
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
but we have no no ability to
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
cross-examine or talk to the to the
 
04:07:10.590 --> 04:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
originator of the complaint thank you
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the yes
 
04:07:11.920 --> 04:07:14.269 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the yes
represent

04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:07:16.830 --> 04:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
luno sure thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much commissioner for
 
04:07:21.309 --> 04:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
joining us as your in Your Capacity as
 
04:07:25.109 --> 04:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
fraternity advisor um so I I've got a
 
04:07:28.109 --> 04:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
little bit of experience um uh being in
 
04:07:31.389 --> 04:07:31.399 align:start position:0%
Greek life uh in another institution and
 
04:07:36.070 --> 04:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
um and as I recall um when um when there
 
04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
was um maybe dis plenary action being
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
cons considered before things went to uh
 
04:07:45.269 --> 04:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
the Dean's office um
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh the inner fraternity Council would
 
04:07:51.870 --> 04:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
get involved and the IFC I believe was a
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
was a an organization on campus with
 
04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
members from each of the the the
 
04:07:59.790 --> 04:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
fraternity fraternities on campus that
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
would um um you know review complaints
 
04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering does does that type
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
of due process exist at UNH it does on
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
minor um offenses but as I've said it's
 
04:08:16.510 --> 04:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
really intertwined because it's really
 
04:08:19.469 --> 04:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
uh that process and what goes on really
 
04:08:23.109 --> 04:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
is controlled to a large degree by the
 
04:08:26.189 --> 04:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
Greek the fraternity and sority life
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
advisor I mean it is very hard to to
 
04:08:31.469 --> 04:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
totally separate the two of them which I
 
04:08:33.790 --> 04:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
think they should be but the way it
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
practically works it doesn't um the
 
04:08:39.149 --> 04:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
letter that we received again I have it
 
04:08:41.790 --> 04:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
here um about the minor infraction which
 
04:08:44.550 --> 04:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
we we dealt with through a um an
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
informal process which worked well
 
04:08:48.590 --> 04:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
frankly I didn't want to go that route
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
because I was I felt so strongly that
 
04:08:54.910 --> 04:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
having 12 to 20 people in your house is
 
04:08:57.429 --> 04:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
just not how do how do you how do they
 
04:08:59.550 --> 04:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
get to tell us we can't use our our
 
04:09:01.710 --> 04:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
facilities the guys decided that it
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't worth it um but that letter came
 
04:09:08.750 --> 04:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
and said you are in violation of
 
04:09:10.269 --> 04:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
now would you like a
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
hearing you know they did Apologize
 
04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
later saying yeah they they needed to
 
04:09:17.790 --> 04:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
update their form letters um but again
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's not totally independent
 
04:09:22.590 --> 04:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
because you go to the informal hearing
 
04:09:25.070 --> 04:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
and the one of the staff members from
 
04:09:28.269 --> 04:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
fraternity sorority life is there
 
04:09:31.149 --> 04:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
advising the um person who's in charge
 
04:09:32.990 --> 04:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
of the charge of the judicial process
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
for IFC so I don't really see them as as
 
04:09:36.520 --> 04:09:38.109 align:start position:0%
for IFC so I don't really see them as as
independent

04:09:38.109 --> 04:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
independent
 
04:09:39.670 --> 04:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank
 
04:09:46.990 --> 04:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
you um like to ask that we now have I
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
see we have Tom Cronin
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
here anybody else from un or the
 
04:09:55.870 --> 04:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
university system that you like to have
 
04:09:57.469 --> 04:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
come up at the same time we have a few
 
04:09:59.229 --> 04:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
of us if I could start and then maybe
 
04:10:00.109 --> 04:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
pass it off because I think there's
 
04:10:01.950 --> 04:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
people who will speak to different
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
pieces all right so I think so thank you
 
04:10:07.229 --> 04:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
uh members of the committee Tom pronin
 
04:10:10.030 --> 04:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
with the University system uh so first
 
04:10:11.429 --> 04:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
just want to say thank you to
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative Glenn representative
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
beler for working through the amendment
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
certainly the the adjustment in the
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceeding section uh we
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate being heard on that during uh
 
04:10:22.670 --> 04:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
the hearing that said I think there are
 
04:10:24.309 --> 04:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
still challenges inside of this
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and ultimately it doesn't
 
04:10:28.670 --> 04:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
significantly change the underlying text
 
04:10:32.510 --> 04:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
of 1288 um and so what I I hope we could
 
04:10:34.550 --> 04:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
do is maybe have a couple appropriate
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
folks walk through uh both on the HR and
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
our collective bargaining side and then
 
04:10:42.910 --> 04:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
also our student Affair side uh just was
 
04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that they had
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
shared with us as we were working
 
04:10:48.070 --> 04:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
through this um and then hopefully to
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
kind of take questions from there just
 
04:10:51.830 --> 04:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
quickly on the amendment I think and I
 
04:10:54.389 --> 04:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if this was an an error or
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
purposeful uh we had a conversation
 
04:10:59.349 --> 04:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
during the hearing uh that we were
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about the the definition of
 
04:11:04.229 --> 04:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
faculty member uh and again I'm not sure
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
if it was meant but the amendment
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
strikes aary status um which essentially
 
04:11:12.189 --> 04:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
would give then full protection to a
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
faculty member on their first day full
 
04:11:16.030 --> 04:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
or part-time we also discussed obviously
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
there's a range of different faculty
 
04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
types at the University in full and
 
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
part-time doesn't entirely cover that um
 
04:11:24.510 --> 04:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
again folks will speak a little bit more
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
to this and we are just reading the new
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
section four uh but that does seem to
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
raise a number of concerns that sort of
 
04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
handcuff us a bit in the event that
 
04:11:34.269 --> 04:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
actual criminal charges are filed
 
04:11:36.070 --> 04:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
against uh either a student or a faculty
 
04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
member um in terms of how we can proceed
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
there you know I think with the
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
exception of the commissioner's points
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
he made a second ago that I think our
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
our colleagues from Student Life can
 
04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
discuss I think our main point at the
 
04:11:50.790 --> 04:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
hearing a few weeks ago was simply there
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
is not there are not complaints at the
 
04:11:54.750 --> 04:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
University system or the community
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
college system that are warranting 1288
 
04:11:58.990 --> 04:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
and that we have between our student
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
rules rights and responsibilities our
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements and
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
even for folks who would not be covered
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
by this due process rules for all of our
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
employees that cover uh everything we're
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish here so I'm hopeful
 
04:12:12.870 --> 04:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
that with my colleagues speaking through
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of their concerns we can
 
04:12:17.109 --> 04:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
continue to see that we have a a strong
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
body of policy behind this um that sort
 
04:12:21.750 --> 04:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
of makes 1288
 
04:12:24.189 --> 04:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so with that if I can I
 
04:12:26.670 --> 04:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
think I'd like to ask Tracy and John
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
Wallen to speak first from the HR and
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.239 --> 04:12:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
Tom

04:12:41.030 --> 04:12:41.040 align:start position:0%

of New Hampshire I serve as the chief
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
negotiator for the University on the
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements with
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%

04:13:15.109 --> 04:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
among other things grievance process
 
04:13:15.119 --> 04:13:16.349 align:start position:0%
among other things grievance process
that

04:13:16.349 --> 04:13:16.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
um yes mirrors a lot of the language in
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
1288 so I wanted to approach this first
 
04:13:26.229 --> 04:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
I mic down a little bit more yeah right
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I work with the university
 
04:13:29.790 --> 04:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
extensively on our employment
 
04:13:31.950 --> 04:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
relationships and one of the things that
 
04:13:34.269 --> 04:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
I think it's important for us to
 
04:13:37.710 --> 04:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
understand this proposed bill
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
would impact certain classes of
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
employees which includes student
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
employees and faculty but not all of our
 
04:13:46.710 --> 04:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
employees um one of the things that Tom
 
04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
was alluding to we already have very
 
04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
extensive due process protections the
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
university system embodies in policy
 
04:13:56.469 --> 04:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
something that we feel is really
 
04:13:59.790 --> 04:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
important which from an employment
 
04:14:02.830 --> 04:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
perspective always a first objective is
 
04:14:05.229 --> 04:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
to make sure that our employees are
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
heard and that we have the opportunity
 
04:14:10.670 --> 04:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
to engage with our with our employees
 
04:14:13.030 --> 04:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this bill puts
 
04:14:16.109 --> 04:14:16.119 align:start position:0%
forward is really an adversarial system
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
which would replace our current system
 
04:14:23.149 --> 04:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
which is a really robust due process
 
04:14:26.070 --> 04:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
protection that also allows us as an
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
employer to work with our
 
04:14:31.469 --> 04:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
employees which for those of you who
 
04:14:33.670 --> 04:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
work in an employment environment is
 
04:14:36.189 --> 04:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
really important to make sure that we
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
have a collegial environment that allows
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
for our employees to work with each
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
other in a way that's effective the bill
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
would substitute for that something that
 
04:14:50.070 --> 04:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
looks much more like an adversarial
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
system and some of the process that we
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
see here would really undermine what we
 
04:14:59.790 --> 04:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:03.710 --> 04:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
do try speak a little more loudly uh in
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
addition to everything that try had said
 
04:15:06.720 --> 04:15:07.550 align:start position:0%
addition to everything that try had said
the

04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
language even um in the uh amended
 
04:15:14.229 --> 04:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
language that we shared with us today uh
 
04:15:17.670 --> 04:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
regarding uh one disciplinary proceeding
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
and the removal of uh the word uh
 
04:15:23.550 --> 04:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
reprimanded uh doesn't actually address
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
um in his totality the concerns that we
 
04:15:28.990 --> 04:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
have about the first level of
 
04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh discipline uh occurring in a
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
typically informal fashion and in fact
 
04:15:37.750 --> 04:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
most often uh cases that may and in
 
04:15:40.510 --> 04:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
suspension or termination of A Faculty
 
04:15:43.950 --> 04:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
member's uh Position will start with a
 
04:15:46.830 --> 04:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
far more innocuous uh discussions an
 
04:15:49.109 --> 04:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
example may be uh that a student reports
 
04:15:51.550 --> 04:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
a faculty member canceling a class uh
 
04:15:53.309 --> 04:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
something that would be very normal as a
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
routine part of A Faculty member's day
 
04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh but their chair may want to speak to
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
them about that or their Dean may want
 
04:16:00.030 --> 04:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
to speak to them about that and as part
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
of that discussion May determine or may
 
04:16:04.030 --> 04:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
discover that in fact it was not a
 
04:16:05.950 --> 04:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
single class that was canceled there was
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
a pattern of these classes being
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
canceled and in fact the faculty member
 
04:16:10.910 --> 04:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
has not been responsive to students and
 
04:16:13.389 --> 04:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
that may lead to something that was not
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
known or intended at the time of the
 
04:16:16.950 --> 04:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
initial discussion and I think that the
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
way that this language in n288 is
 
04:16:23.070 --> 04:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
drafted um it it creates an impediment
 
04:16:26.429 --> 04:16:26.439 align:start position:0%
to having those earlier conversations in
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
a more collegial way in a time frame
 
04:16:30.910 --> 04:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
that is uh more quick and remediating
 
04:16:32.830 --> 04:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the vast majority of
 
04:16:35.109 --> 04:16:35.119 align:start position:0%
complaints that come in in a more time
 
04:16:37.469 --> 04:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
sensitive and and appropriate fashion
 
04:16:39.469 --> 04:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh the other point uh to something that
 
04:16:41.349 --> 04:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
Tom had raised earlier with respect to
 
04:16:43.630 --> 04:16:43.640 align:start position:0%
three faculty member meaning a full or
 
04:16:44.950 --> 04:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
part-time member of The Faculty of a
 
04:16:47.070 --> 04:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
public institution of higher education
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh without taking too much of the
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee's time I did just want to
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
address that faculty uh come in all
 
04:16:54.109 --> 04:16:54.119 align:start position:0%
shapes and sizes not just full or
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
part-time but in fact uh we have a
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
number of Faculty who are not employees
 
04:16:59.309 --> 04:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
of the University of New Hampshire but
 
04:17:01.229 --> 04:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
are considered members of The Faculty uh
 
04:17:02.510 --> 04:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
those would be individuals who are
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
considered either affiliate faculty
 
04:17:05.950 --> 04:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
members or visiting faculty members who
 
04:17:08.149 --> 04:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
may be employed by another institution
 
04:17:09.510 --> 04:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh during their time at the University
 
04:17:11.309 --> 04:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
they are still afforded the opportunity
 
04:17:12.790 --> 04:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh and the due process that is outlined
 
04:17:15.189 --> 04:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
in our policies I'm raising that simply
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
to point out that it would not uh be
 
04:17:19.630 --> 04:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
captured uh in the language under
 
04:17:21.990 --> 04:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
three I apologize One More point to
 
04:17:24.510 --> 04:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
build off of that um John alluded to the
 
04:17:26.950 --> 04:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
timeliness issue as an employer as all
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
of you probably know we have obligations
 
04:17:31.349 --> 04:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
to follow up if we have employees who
 
04:17:34.109 --> 04:17:34.119 align:start position:0%
raise concerns to timely follow up on
 
04:17:37.389 --> 04:17:37.399 align:start position:0%
that our current due process protection
 
04:17:39.710 --> 04:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
contemplate that so to John's point
 
04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
about we work with folks early and
 
04:17:44.910 --> 04:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
collegially to address issues but if we
 
04:17:47.109 --> 04:17:47.119 align:start position:0%
have employees who are raising concerns
 
04:17:49.309 --> 04:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
to us we have legal obligations to
 
04:17:52.630 --> 04:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
follow up on that timely promptly and
 
04:17:54.990 --> 04:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
our existing process I think does that
 
04:17:57.309 --> 04:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
very effectively some of the things we
 
04:17:59.469 --> 04:17:59.479 align:start position:0%
see in the new bill with timelines
 
04:18:01.790 --> 04:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
requirements for disclosures a really
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
adversarial process I think would
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
probably be impediments to doing that
 
04:18:06.359 --> 04:18:09.590 align:start position:0%
probably be impediments to doing that
timeline

04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
are there anything further no thank you
 
04:18:14.910 --> 04:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative Miler
 
04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:18:19.990 --> 04:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
being here so the question that I would
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
have is that uh what is your what do you
 
04:18:26.429 --> 04:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
believe that the impact I've got two
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
questions actually what would be the
 
04:18:29.109 --> 04:18:29.119 align:start position:0%
impact of
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
1288 as proposed to your policies and
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
your CBA that you have that that you're
 
04:18:39.870 --> 04:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
working off of right now that's question
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
one please you want to start yeah I'd be
 
04:18:44.510 --> 04:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
happy to um so the way that our
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
collected bargaining Agreements are
 
04:18:48.349 --> 04:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
drafted in the way that um the Canon of
 
04:18:50.149 --> 04:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
labor law works is a traditionally
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
around a progressive disciplinary
 
04:18:52.830 --> 04:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
process I'm sorry I'm Miss speaking
 
04:18:54.550 --> 04:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
loudly enough thank you around a
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
progressive disciplinary process uh
 
04:19:00.109 --> 04:19:00.119 align:start position:0%
which uh ensures that before any um
 
04:19:02.030 --> 04:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
action uh adverse to an employees
 
04:19:03.950 --> 04:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
employment status is taken they are
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
afforded the opportunity to have a
 
04:19:07.550 --> 04:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
discussion and to provide uh that
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
information as I said earlier that is
 
04:19:13.149 --> 04:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
most often in most instances uh done
 
04:19:15.149 --> 04:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
verbally uh and is done either
 
04:19:19.149 --> 04:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
informally or fairly quickly um meaning
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
quickly from when we are aware of the
 
04:19:23.309 --> 04:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
issue to when we try and have that
 
04:19:25.109 --> 04:19:25.119 align:start position:0%
conversation so that we're working with
 
04:19:26.750 --> 04:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
and supporting our employee as quickly
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
as possible so that they are aware of
 
04:19:31.469 --> 04:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
the concern they can provide what they
 
04:19:34.229 --> 04:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh believe to be the facts or their
 
04:19:36.149 --> 04:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
explanation for the behavior if in fact
 
04:19:37.149 --> 04:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
it occurred
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh and we can work with them uh
 
04:19:40.510 --> 04:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
supporting them in uh contining to move
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
forward in in a productive employment
 
04:19:46.590 --> 04:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
relationship so if I may yes so if if
 
04:19:48.790 --> 04:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing what you're
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
saying that the proposed
 
04:19:55.469 --> 04:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
1288 could
 
04:19:58.189 --> 04:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
interfere with that early
 
04:20:02.830 --> 04:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
step of the in your definition of
 
04:20:02.840 --> 04:20:04.189 align:start position:0%
step of the in your definition of
collegial

04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
collegial
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
environment that it would interfere with
 
04:20:08.550 --> 04:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
that early step of trying to seek some
 
04:20:09.830 --> 04:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
04:20:14.269 --> 04:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
resolution to the issue prior to an
 
04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
official movement into a uh a
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
progressive discipline kind of an
 
04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
approach that this would uh call for is
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
that correct yes representative that's
 
04:20:27.550 --> 04:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
exactly correct thank you so what's HR
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
do then when you have an issue going on
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
is there not an informal step that's
 
04:20:34.950 --> 04:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
taken prior to either a reprimand
 
04:20:37.309 --> 04:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
suspension or
 
04:20:38.950 --> 04:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
in in in K through2 we call it
 
04:20:41.229 --> 04:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
revification of of of your teaching
 
04:20:44.590 --> 04:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
ticket but you it would be exp expulsion
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
isn't there anything informal that goes
 
04:20:50.189 --> 04:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
on prior to those possible three steps
 
04:20:51.790 --> 04:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
which were in the bill has introduced
 
04:20:53.950 --> 04:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
two steps which are in the
 
04:20:56.109 --> 04:20:56.119 align:start position:0%
amendment go ahead yeah and I think
 
04:20:57.790 --> 04:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
you've put your finger right on the
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
issue our process right now has a lot of
 
04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
steps before we get to something that
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
would be as significant as that but the
 
04:21:08.189 --> 04:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
proposed bill is talking about needing
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
to take immediately into an adversarial
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
situation anytime if it could result in
 
04:21:17.670 --> 04:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
that so to John's point when we start
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
our process which is always
 
04:21:22.109 --> 04:21:22.119 align:start position:0%
intentionally at the outset we want to
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
have discussions with folks that could
 
04:21:24.720 --> 04:21:25.710 align:start position:0%
have discussions with folks that could
result

04:21:25.710 --> 04:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
result
 
04:21:28.590 --> 04:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
in serious discipline depending on what
 
04:21:32.750 --> 04:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
happened so the bill as proposed to your
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
point would put us in a position to say
 
04:21:38.269 --> 04:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
all of those early stage processes would
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
be put into doubt to say could we do
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
that consistent with the law if this
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
went forward to say we would be then in
 
04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy to say well did we do the
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
process that requires Witnesses written
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
statements um it's just inconsistent
 
04:21:58.349 --> 04:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:02.189 --> 04:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
works so are those informal stages
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is that part of the
 
04:22:03.840 --> 04:22:04.990 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is that part of the
due

04:22:04.990 --> 04:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
due
 
04:22:08.189 --> 04:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
process that we now are looking at in
 
04:22:10.830 --> 04:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
terms of this legislation which is
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
taking steps beyond the policy that's
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.269 --> 04:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
UNH but part of the problem is it's
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
eliminating in some respects it would
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate all of the options we have
 
04:22:27.950 --> 04:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
under existing policy to try to address
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
things less in the outside of the
 
04:22:32.109 --> 04:22:32.119 align:start position:0%
adversarial process the bill is
 
04:22:34.990 --> 04:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
proposing an adversarial process really
 
04:22:37.429 --> 04:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
anytime something could lead lead to
 
04:22:40.030 --> 04:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
significant discipline our current
 
04:22:42.870 --> 04:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
process by policy and John can speak to
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
in our cbas talk about doing oral verbal
 
04:22:50.429 --> 04:22:50.439 align:start position:0%
conversations we do oral warnings we do
 
04:22:53.109 --> 04:22:53.119 align:start position:0%
a first written warning oftentimes those
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
are you as casual as conversations in an
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
office so that you can give people
 
04:23:01.590 --> 04:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
immediate feedback that could ultimately
 
04:23:04.389 --> 04:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
lead to discipline but that doesn't mean
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
from our perspective that the situation
 
04:23:08.349 --> 04:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
is best addressed by making it
 
04:23:10.149 --> 04:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
adversarial from the
 
04:23:13.870 --> 04:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
outset and the bill as proposed seems to
 
04:23:13.880 --> 04:23:15.269 align:start position:0%
outset and the bill as proposed seems to
contemplate

04:23:15.269 --> 04:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
contemplate
 
04:23:17.790 --> 04:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
that the process you're talking about
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
here your collective bargaining
 
04:23:23.109 --> 04:23:23.119 align:start position:0%
agreements with those that are employed
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
what about the students that would not
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
come underneath the CVA that now where's
 
04:23:31.229 --> 04:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
their informal process yeah and you've
 
04:23:33.149 --> 04:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
raised another very good point because
 
04:23:35.349 --> 04:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
and our colleagues will speak to them
 
04:23:38.550 --> 04:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
the student EXP experience as students I
 
04:23:41.710 --> 04:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
can speak to it as students as employees
 
04:23:43.950 --> 04:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
one of the educational one of the
 
04:23:47.070 --> 04:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
purposes of um we employ
 
04:23:49.550 --> 04:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
students as part of their educational
 
04:23:52.030 --> 04:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
Mission or our educational Mission along
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
with it helps get things done but
 
04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
students are employees and under our
 
04:23:59.429 --> 04:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
existing policies they're entitled to
 
04:24:01.070 --> 04:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
some of the same due process that we
 
04:24:03.790 --> 04:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
apply to our other employees one of the
 
04:24:05.349 --> 04:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
other challenges when I was looking at
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
this bill was to say well we're creating
 
04:24:09.389 --> 04:24:09.399 align:start position:0%
two classes of employees we've got
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
student employees who will be subject to
 
04:24:13.790 --> 04:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
the bill we've got faculty who are
 
04:24:15.790 --> 04:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
employees who would be subject to the
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
bill and then we have a whole host of
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
other employees who would fall under our
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
existing policies from my experience
 
04:24:28.630 --> 04:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
particularly for student employees that
 
04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
informal non-adversarial process is
 
04:24:34.550 --> 04:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
really important because often times
 
04:24:36.790 --> 04:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
these are young workers and when I say
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
young I mean new to employment and it's
 
04:24:41.710 --> 04:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
really important to them to have that
 
04:24:44.590 --> 04:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity that comes with
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
giving a new employee feedback and this
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
process that's contemplated with the
 
04:24:52.269 --> 04:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
bill will make it an adversarial process
 
04:24:53.429 --> 04:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
that really I think is going to
 
04:24:56.389 --> 04:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
undermine that important aspect of
 
04:24:56.399 --> 04:24:57.510 align:start position:0%
undermine that important aspect of
student

04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:24:59.469 --> 04:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
employment further questions from the
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
04:25:03.870 --> 04:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you thank you for being
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
here and explaining uh the
 
04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
uh processes you have in CBA um but if
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
there is the informal conversations and
 
04:25:18.070 --> 04:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
discussions that that you talked about
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
um at some point there might well be uh
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
further discipline required and would
 
04:25:28.590 --> 04:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
would wouldn't you have in place
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
something that's um Ain to what is laid
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
out on page two of the bill yeah so
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
specific to the collective bargaining
 
04:25:39.389 --> 04:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
agreements that we have currently we
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
have a process that was negotiated with
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
obviously uh the representatives for
 
04:25:48.550 --> 04:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
those um agreements they are similar to
 
04:25:51.309 --> 04:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
but different um in terms of the timing
 
04:25:53.070 --> 04:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
that occurs uh in terms of the way that
 
04:25:55.309 --> 04:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
notification is uh is provided and
 
04:25:58.070 --> 04:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
processed in terms of uh the
 
04:26:00.910 --> 04:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
identification of which Advocates uh are
 
04:26:02.429 --> 04:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
permissive to be able to be brought to
 
04:26:05.550 --> 04:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
that as well as uh the scope uh and the
 
04:26:08.590 --> 04:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
potential outcomes um that could occur
 
04:26:10.349 --> 04:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
the standard is also different uh for
 
04:26:12.870 --> 04:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
moving forward with a uh termination
 
04:26:14.670 --> 04:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
case against for example a 10e faculty
 
04:26:16.109 --> 04:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
member we have a just cause standard
 
04:26:18.429 --> 04:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
that we have to uh that we have to meet
 
04:26:19.389 --> 04:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
which is different than the
 
04:26:20.830 --> 04:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
preponderance standard that's included
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
here um we also have um additional steps
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
in our process uh that require uh the
 
04:26:29.109 --> 04:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
engagement of the president of the
 
04:26:31.070 --> 04:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
institution uh the engagement of our
 
04:26:33.269 --> 04:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
faculty Senate uh for peer review and
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary uh recommendations uh as
 
04:26:38.030 --> 04:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
well as the opportunity for uh obviously
 
04:26:39.790 --> 04:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
the individual to afford themselves uh
 
04:26:41.469 --> 04:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
to a representative from the UN from
 
04:26:43.510 --> 04:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
their Union uh to be in attendance at
 
04:26:47.070 --> 04:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
all uh meetings that they have with the
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
administration represent M thank you
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
again thank you uh for responding to my
 
04:26:56.550 --> 04:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
question um how many unions do you have
 
04:26:58.750 --> 04:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh at the University at the University
 
04:27:00.229 --> 04:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire currently we have four
 
04:27:02.670 --> 04:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
threee faculty and one is uh as you uh
 
04:27:04.750 --> 04:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
noted earlier with uh Chief Dean and the
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
police department
 
04:27:09.109 --> 04:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
just on a followup I'm assuming that
 
04:27:11.389 --> 04:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
your student employees are not unionized
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct so the the issue
 
04:27:18.309 --> 04:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
of dealing with issues where does past
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
practice come in as a as it relates to
 
04:27:24.750 --> 04:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
solving similar issues uh with your
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
particularly with your student with your
 
04:27:28.990 --> 04:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
student group sure Tracy yeah and the
 
04:27:31.830 --> 04:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
student your your spot on is closer
 
04:27:34.229 --> 04:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
please yeah the practice with respect to
 
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
our student employees is the import
 
04:27:37.269 --> 04:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
important aspect that you're you're
 
04:27:39.630 --> 04:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
highlighting it's our practice when we
 
04:27:42.550 --> 04:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
have student employees to work with them
 
04:27:45.269 --> 04:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
in that process that I discussed to say
 
04:27:47.630 --> 04:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
you discuss issues in their employment
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
verbally first followed by you know
 
04:27:52.870 --> 04:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
process that becomes more
 
04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
formal I I still don't have my mind
 
04:27:59.070 --> 04:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
fixed to what's going on here the bill
 
04:28:00.990 --> 04:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
itself says relative to establishing
 
04:28:02.910 --> 04:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
certain due process rights for students
 
04:28:05.109 --> 04:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
student organizations we're not talking
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
student employees we may be but we're
 
04:28:10.710 --> 04:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
talking about students that are there to
 
04:28:12.670 --> 04:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
learn the academics and to have a little
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
bit of fun on campus and um and
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
organizations like we heard about the
 
04:28:20.670 --> 04:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
fraternity earlier so they're not
 
04:28:23.389 --> 04:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
employees what's the first step for them
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
is there an informal process of
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
notifying them that who has made the the
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
concern who you know submitted that and
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
how are we going to work with you to try
 
04:28:34.910 --> 04:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
and correct this you want yeah and I
 
04:28:37.269 --> 04:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
think as we're talking about students in
 
04:28:40.990 --> 04:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
the student as students being subject to
 
04:28:43.109 --> 04:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
student discipline I think we have some
 
04:28:44.910 --> 04:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues who will speak to that and I
 
04:28:47.309 --> 04:28:47.319 align:start position:0%
apologize if I've kind of created um
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
confusion about the students as
 
04:28:51.149 --> 04:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
employees versus students as students
 
04:28:53.309 --> 04:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
there is an entirely different process
 
04:28:55.630 --> 04:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
for them um which Tom alluded to our
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
student rules rights responsibilities
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
document creates extensive due process
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
protections for students as they are
 
04:29:07.149 --> 04:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
engaged with our um student conduct
 
04:29:09.309 --> 04:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
process versus the student employment
 
04:29:12.309 --> 04:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
which is frankly a much less significant
 
04:29:14.790 --> 04:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so maybe it's best that we
 
04:29:17.309 --> 04:29:17.319 align:start position:0%
move to the those that can come up and
 
04:29:17.319 --> 04:29:18.309 align:start position:0%
move to the those that can come up and
speak

04:29:18.309 --> 04:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:29:21.109 --> 04:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
to the what 1400
 
04:29:24.189 --> 04:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
students that you're dealing
 
04:29:29.630 --> 04:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.720 --> 04:29:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Mike Blackman
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm the Dina students at the University
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire been there for about
 
04:29:50.189 --> 04:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
three years now and I'm noting that to
 
04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
state that I am a different Dina
 
04:29:53.149 --> 04:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
students than the DEA students referen
 
04:29:57.309 --> 04:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
by commissioner Jasper earlier in the
 
04:29:59.790 --> 04:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
day afternoon thank you for having me my
 
04:30:01.309 --> 04:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
name is Alexis Pinero Benson I'm the
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
director of community standards I
 
04:30:05.149 --> 04:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
oversee and administer the University's
 
04:30:05.159 --> 04:30:07.590 align:start position:0%
oversee and administer the University's
disciplinary

04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
04:30:10.590 --> 04:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
system so I'll try not to repeat much of
 
04:30:12.429 --> 04:30:12.439 align:start position:0%
what my colleague shared earlier today
 
04:30:15.469 --> 04:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
but I'll note that the purpose behind
 
04:30:17.710 --> 04:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is good that we believe that
 
04:30:19.229 --> 04:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
students and student organizations
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
should be afforded due process
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
protections no matter what the
 
04:30:25.830 --> 04:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
allegation is and as has been referenced
 
04:30:28.109 --> 04:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
a couple times we have extensive conduct
 
04:30:29.510 --> 04:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
procedures that are described in our
 
04:30:30.429 --> 04:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
student rights rules and
 
04:30:32.830 --> 04:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities handbook that say for
 
04:30:35.109 --> 04:30:35.119 align:start position:0%
any sanction what a student can expect
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of of those due process
 
04:30:39.309 --> 04:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
protections we know that students
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
education is a thing of value to them
 
04:30:43.710 --> 04:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
and that doing anything that impacts
 
04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
that education is depriving them of that
 
04:30:48.030 --> 04:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh property and that value and we take
 
04:30:50.910 --> 04:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
that responsibility seriously and as has
 
04:30:53.070 --> 04:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
been stated the due process protections
 
04:30:55.309 --> 04:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
afforded to students are proportional to
 
04:30:57.870 --> 04:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
the potential sanction and so I want to
 
04:30:59.950 --> 04:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the change the
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
amendment raising the bar removing the
 
04:31:04.630 --> 04:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
word reprimand and raising the bar by
 
04:31:07.070 --> 04:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
which this applies to students uh to
 
04:31:10.670 --> 04:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
suspension or potential expulsion is
 
04:31:13.710 --> 04:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
good and we believe that when a student
 
04:31:16.109 --> 04:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
is facing potential loss for their
 
04:31:17.550 --> 04:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
education either temporarily or
 
04:31:18.790 --> 04:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
permanently that there should be
 
04:31:20.469 --> 04:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
extensive due process protections
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
afforded to them that will be more
 
04:31:23.590 --> 04:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
extensive than when a student is
 
04:31:25.349 --> 04:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
potentially getting a warning for
 
04:31:27.149 --> 04:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
holding a beer while they're
 
04:31:31.389 --> 04:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
underage I will say that um a few
 
04:31:33.389 --> 04:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
remaining amendments would still be
 
04:31:36.269 --> 04:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
helpful if it all to be considered
 
04:31:38.830 --> 04:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
the first being that uh defining student
 
04:31:42.030 --> 04:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
organizations to only apply when student
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
organizations have actually been
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
recognized versus seeking organization
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh seeking recognition status for our
 
04:31:51.109 --> 04:31:51.119 align:start position:0%
purposes a group of students that is
 
04:31:53.469 --> 04:31:53.479 align:start position:0%
seeking recognition is not formally
 
04:31:55.830 --> 04:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
recognized and does not have the
 
04:31:57.630 --> 04:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
protections afforded to a recognized
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
student organization they are just a
 
04:32:02.109 --> 04:32:02.119 align:start position:0%
group of students at that point in
 
04:32:04.389 --> 04:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
addition we would recommend that a
 
04:32:06.990 --> 04:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
similar threat hold bar be applied to
 
04:32:08.750 --> 04:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
student organizations as it was to
 
04:32:11.469 --> 04:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
students in the amendment raising the
 
04:32:13.469 --> 04:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
bar by which the disciplinary proceeding
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
would be defined to include suspension
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
and Beyond to be the same for student
 
04:32:20.109 --> 04:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
organizations uh student organizations
 
04:32:23.070 --> 04:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
facing loss of recognition or suspension
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
or dismissal from the school we believe
 
04:32:27.830 --> 04:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
that those should have more significant
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
due process protections and similarly
 
04:32:31.349 --> 04:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
when we're issuing a student
 
04:32:33.830 --> 04:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
organization a warning because they've
 
04:32:36.189 --> 04:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
been a little bit too loud um we
 
04:32:37.750 --> 04:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
certainly think they should have due
 
04:32:39.870 --> 04:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
process protections afforded to them but
 
04:32:41.590 --> 04:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
those should be different from when a
 
04:32:43.109 --> 04:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
student organization is potentially
 
04:32:45.189 --> 04:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
facing the loss of
 
04:32:48.149 --> 04:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
recognition I also want to address um
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
and then I'll pause the amendment on the
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
second page certainly understanding the
 
04:32:57.510 --> 04:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
importance of um not having evidence
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
from a disciplinary proceeding be
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
admissible in a court of law I will say
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
that the second sentence and beyond that
 
04:33:07.390 --> 04:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
requires that we wait until the criminal
 
04:33:09.390 --> 04:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
proceeding be complete before we proceed
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
with a disciplinary proceeding on our
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
end would be incredibly challenging for
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
us um we have an obligation to respond
 
04:33:19.990 --> 04:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
quickly and swiftly when we learn of a
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
potential violation I understand the
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
motivation behind it but we know that
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
Court proceedings can sometimes take
 
04:33:30.429 --> 04:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
months or years to complete and under
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
many laws we have an obligation to
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
respond as Tracy referenced um within a
 
04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
certain time frame or even if a certain
 
04:33:39.629 --> 04:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
time frame hasn't be specified that we
 
04:33:41.629 --> 04:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
still act quickly to protect our
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
community and if we're not able to do
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
that and have to wait for potentially
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
months or years for a criminal
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
proceeding to be over that would really
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
limit our ability to do that uh I
 
04:33:54.269 --> 04:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
understand that there was a clause put
 
04:33:56.949 --> 04:33:56.959 align:start position:0%
in to say that we can take temporary
 
04:33:58.990 --> 04:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
actions pending the completion of a
 
04:34:01.949 --> 04:34:01.959 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding however any interim
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
actions that we Implement are meant to
 
04:34:07.189 --> 04:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
address highly significant Behavior we
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
have a very high threshold for when we
 
04:34:11.470 --> 04:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
do that because the nature of an interim
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
action means that the student is not
 
04:34:15.670 --> 04:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
getting their due process protections
 
04:34:18.029 --> 04:34:18.039 align:start position:0%
under the code of conduct we're acting
 
04:34:21.390 --> 04:34:21.400 align:start position:0%
quickly so it would not be ideal to be
 
04:34:24.510 --> 04:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
implementing many temporary or interim
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
measures waiting for a criminal
 
04:34:28.269 --> 04:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
proceeding to complete we want to be
 
04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
able to give students their full process
 
04:34:32.910 --> 04:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
as quickly and resolve these things for
 
04:34:36.269 --> 04:34:36.279 align:start position:0%
students as quickly as we can
 
04:34:41.590 --> 04:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mike um is Alex Alexis yeah is
 
04:34:42.629 --> 04:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
do you have anything anything else to
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
add right now Mya students is such a
 
04:34:45.000 --> 04:34:47.390 align:start position:0%
add right now Mya students is such a
great

04:34:47.390 --> 04:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
job this is the new Dean too the new
 
04:34:54.029 --> 04:34:54.039 align:start position:0%
Dean yes abely so questions from the
 
04:34:56.390 --> 04:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent Miler yes thank
 
04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for being here could
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
you review for us the various
 
04:35:05.910 --> 04:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
levels from just a conversation
 
04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
what are the what are the levels of due
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
process and actions that you might take
 
04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
and give us some at least some examples
 
04:35:15.869 --> 04:35:15.879 align:start position:0%
like you know if I violate it because
 
04:35:17.629 --> 04:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
I'm breaking and I'm not sure obviously
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
that's a much lower could you move up
 
04:35:23.789 --> 04:35:23.799 align:start position:0%
that scale to to ultimately dismissal
 
04:35:27.910 --> 04:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
sure so um in our code of conduct we
 
04:35:30.349 --> 04:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
have generally two forms of resolution
 
04:35:34.109 --> 04:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
which is a conference or a hearing and
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of our
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings are resolved
 
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
through a conference which tends to be a
 
04:35:41.949 --> 04:35:41.959 align:start position:0%
one-on-one conversation with a staff
 
04:35:44.230 --> 04:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
member U to put it in perspective we had
 
04:35:47.070 --> 04:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
about 3,000 overall allegations last
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
year and only 80 of them resulted in a
 
04:35:51.629 --> 04:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
hearing because the vast majority of
 
04:35:53.910 --> 04:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
them are lower level violations that
 
04:35:55.830 --> 04:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
happen in the residence Halls people
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
making too much noise students underage
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
drinking that we know are only going to
 
04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
result in a warning or potentially um an
 
04:36:05.629 --> 04:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
educational sanction that go with that
 
04:36:07.990 --> 04:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
so in those lower level cases the basic
 
04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
due process proceeding uh protections
 
04:36:11.830 --> 04:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
that students are all afforded is right
 
04:36:14.230 --> 04:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
to notice to have a notice of the
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
allegations uh they right to have a
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
meaningful opportunity to respond before
 
04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
any uh final decisions are made um the
 
04:36:24.189 --> 04:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
right to be to have an impartial
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
decision maker make those decisions
 
04:36:29.070 --> 04:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
anything you would add
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
Alexis and then when we start talking
 
04:36:32.910 --> 04:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
about a hearing which we use when a
 
04:36:34.510 --> 04:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
student is going to be suspended a
 
04:36:36.429 --> 04:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
potentially suspended potentially
 
04:36:39.349 --> 04:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
dismissed um or more serious sanctions
 
04:36:42.029 --> 04:36:42.039 align:start position:0%
then we have far more due process
 
04:36:44.269 --> 04:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
protections that include what is in the
 
04:36:46.830 --> 04:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
bill and Beyond including things like a
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
live hearing a panel hearing the right
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
to an advisor um more uh specified
 
04:36:54.789 --> 04:36:54.799 align:start position:0%
timelines of notice and resolution and
 
04:36:55.869 --> 04:36:55.879 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
like sure so when um an activity occurs
 
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
at the fraternity house off campus that
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
we spoke to earlier and the allegation
 
04:37:10.109 --> 04:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
was made to the university
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
itself and contact was then made with
 
04:37:15.910 --> 04:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
the Durham Police where's the due
 
04:37:18.150 --> 04:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
process in this thing is it now due
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
process according to your policy or is
 
04:37:21.869 --> 04:37:21.879 align:start position:0%
it due process according to what the
 
04:37:25.070 --> 04:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
city of Durham has got in place so the
 
04:37:27.150 --> 04:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
two would be two separate processes
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
right if the town of Durham if there's
 
04:37:30.590 --> 04:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
any criminal proceedings then they would
 
04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
have their own separate processes if I
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
think what you're describing is we might
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
be no notified by the Durham Police
 
04:37:38.230 --> 04:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
Department that for example a fraternity
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
house was very loud or well I take it
 
04:37:44.109 --> 04:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
the university
 
04:37:48.070 --> 04:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
notified the police in dur sure so now
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
we have it going that way where's due
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
process exist here is it now out of the
 
04:37:55.590 --> 04:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
baileywick of unh I see what you're
 
04:37:59.629 --> 04:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
saying in that of the town so if by us
 
04:38:01.269 --> 04:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
notifying the police department we're
 
04:38:03.789 --> 04:38:03.799 align:start position:0%
not seeding our right to follow up and
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
normally for the similarly to student
 
04:38:07.949 --> 04:38:07.959 align:start position:0%
organizations the process will depend on
 
04:38:11.070 --> 04:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
the potential sanction similarly most
 
04:38:12.551 --> 04:38:12.561 align:start position:0%
sanctions are going to be informal
 
04:38:15.070 --> 04:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
conversations or Warnings and those are
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
really handled by the governing bodies
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
that have been referenced throughout
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
this uh meeting today the inly council
 
04:38:23.349 --> 04:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
or the panh helenic council those are
 
04:38:26.470 --> 04:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
student governing bodies that part of
 
04:38:28.109 --> 04:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
their role is to respond to these
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
allegations so we would share the police
 
04:38:33.189 --> 04:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
report for example or the complaint with
 
04:38:35.349 --> 04:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
the respective governing body who will
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
then work to resolve it based on the
 
04:38:40.150 --> 04:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
their bylaws if the organization was
 
04:38:42.551 --> 04:38:42.561 align:start position:0%
facing potential suspension or loss of
 
04:38:45.629 --> 04:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
recognition then we would Implement a
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
different process that had more
 
04:38:49.230 --> 04:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
procedural protections managed by the
 
04:38:53.709 --> 04:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
standards I don't think my my question
 
04:39:00.150 --> 04:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
was really answered oh no
 
04:39:04.470 --> 04:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm if it's now in the hands of
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
the Police Department then they initiate
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
something through the court
 
04:39:15.750 --> 04:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
system where's where's the due
 
04:39:18.670 --> 04:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
process first of all how do how do how
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
does the attorney even know who made the
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
allegation and it seems to me there
 
04:39:29.150 --> 04:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's there's a hole here in terms of
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
following and not I'm not following
 
04:39:32.310 --> 04:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
along if if everything occurred
 
04:39:35.150 --> 04:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
underneath Paul Dean's right right
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
Bailey work I could get it but I'm not
 
04:39:39.550 --> 04:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
getting it now when we involve in you
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
know the the town of Durham coming in
 
04:39:43.910 --> 04:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
saying you're too loud on this
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
fraternity MH and by the way we don't
 
04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
have an ordinance on it but you're just
 
04:39:47.600 --> 04:39:49.350 align:start position:0%
have an ordinance on it but you're just
too

04:39:49.350 --> 04:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:39:52.110 --> 04:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
loud so it might speak to what I was
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
describing earlier with the amendment
 
04:39:57.110 --> 04:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
that the the criminal proceedings and
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
the university proceedings are really
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
two parallel processes that could occur
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
simultaneously it's not common that we
 
04:40:07.230 --> 04:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
would the ones to notify the police
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
maybe a student walked by the house and
 
04:40:11.270 --> 04:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
called the police because they thought
 
04:40:13.990 --> 04:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
it was too loud but more commonly we
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
would hear about an issue from the
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
police and anytime we're talking about
 
04:40:21.070 --> 04:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
the university proceeding the D process
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
protections that I was describing apply
 
04:40:24.628 --> 04:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
it would be managed depending on the
 
04:40:27.470 --> 04:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
severity by the appropriate body most of
 
04:40:30.190 --> 04:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
the time that's the governing body the
 
04:40:31.868 --> 04:40:31.878 align:start position:0%
in fraternity Council the panh helenic
 
04:40:34.990 --> 04:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
council whose due process procedure are
 
04:40:37.670 --> 04:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
described in their bylaws and voted on
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
by the the respective Council so those
 
04:40:42.150 --> 04:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
are the pro those are the protections
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
that would apply the the process that's
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
handled by the court system if there is
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
some separate court process that would
 
04:40:51.150 --> 04:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
be totally separate from us um we would
 
04:40:53.310 --> 04:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
move with our own proceedings following
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
our either our bylaws or our code of
 
04:40:57.750 --> 04:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
conduct um and affording students all
 
04:41:00.390 --> 04:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
the protections outlined therein thank
 
04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
you sure are there any questions for
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee for
 
04:41:06.110 --> 04:41:06.120 align:start position:0%

04:42:04.150 --> 04:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
Department is working on some kind of
 
04:42:05.470 --> 04:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding do they
 
04:42:08.230 --> 04:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
automatically notify us of that that is
 
04:42:10.590 --> 04:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
the question yes uh not necessarily it
 
04:42:12.788 --> 04:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
would depend on the nature of the
 
04:42:16.270 --> 04:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
violation um but as I said earlier we
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
often will receive what we call landlord
 
04:42:20.910 --> 04:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
notifications if a certain house or
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
property is too loud but there's no
 
04:42:26.230 --> 04:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
automatic we get notified of every
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding that's happening in
 
04:42:29.910 --> 04:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham by law enforcement
 
04:42:32.430 --> 04:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much thank you
 
04:42:32.440 --> 04:42:33.550 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much thank you
thank

04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:42:33.560 --> 04:42:44.788 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Shannon Reed here on
 
04:42:48.430 --> 04:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of the community college system
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be brief because you've
 
04:42:51.868 --> 04:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
already heard a lot about what I think
 
04:42:54.270 --> 04:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
concerns that we share um about some of
 
04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
the specifics of this bill and more
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
broadly while I I think the bill is
 
04:42:58.990 --> 04:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
certainly very well-intentioned
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
um I think that it might have been
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
brought without an understanding of the
 
04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
fact that we have very sound robust
 
04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
policies already in place that I think
 
04:43:10.030 --> 04:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
accomplish what the sponsors uh in in um
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
conceptually would want us to have um I
 
04:43:16.190 --> 04:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of what you heard from the
 
04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
University system is congruent with what
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
we experienced except of course we don't
 
04:43:22.310 --> 04:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
have the Greek life component that you
 
04:43:25.150 --> 04:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
heard you heard a story about um at the
 
04:43:27.150 --> 04:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
outset I do have two colleagues here
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
with me from one from HR and uh CBA
 
04:43:31.990 --> 04:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
negotiation and one from student
 
04:43:35.310 --> 04:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
services who I will ask to follow me and
 
04:43:36.750 --> 04:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
and address any kind of specifics that
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
pertain more to our system than what you
 
04:43:40.430 --> 04:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
heard previously from our friends at the
 
04:43:42.270 --> 04:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
University system but a couple things
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
that I'll that I'll point out that um we
 
04:43:45.990 --> 04:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
still would have concerns or questions
 
04:43:47.948 --> 04:43:47.958 align:start position:0%
about um before we'd be comfortable with
 
04:43:49.470 --> 04:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
anything like this going
 
04:43:52.110 --> 04:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
forward um first I think we pointed out
 
04:43:53.788 --> 04:43:53.798 align:start position:0%
in the hearing this bill from the
 
04:43:57.310 --> 04:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
employee standpoint includes faculty but
 
04:43:59.948 --> 04:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
not staff so that would set up a kind of
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
a separate um process for staff and
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
faculty not that I want to suggest
 
04:44:08.550 --> 04:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
expanding the scope of this bill but
 
04:44:10.350 --> 04:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
just pointing out that it would set up
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
that kind of dual um structure so what
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
staff staff faculty got definition for
 
04:44:19.310 --> 04:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
each yes we do not I mean basically
 
04:44:21.550 --> 04:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
people who don't teach I mean I'm staff
 
04:44:24.190 --> 04:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
um CHC Rubenstein is Staff people don't
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
teach you know our regist our bursters
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
our financial aid counselors our
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
admissions officers anyone like
 
04:44:31.200 --> 04:44:33.350 align:start position:0%
admissions officers anyone like
that

04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
um one concern I heard internally when I
 
04:44:37.990 --> 04:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
talked about this bill with some of my
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues pertains to the the hearings
 
04:44:45.390 --> 04:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
as they are outlined in house B 1288 um
 
04:44:48.030 --> 04:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
the bill allows a respondent to
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
cross-examine a
 
04:44:51.550 --> 04:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
complainant basically that the languages
 
04:44:55.150 --> 04:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
confront and cross-examine Witnesses
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
um the bill doesn't set out what legal
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
guard rails would apply in that type of
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
a situation for example um would this
 
04:45:03.600 --> 04:45:05.510 align:start position:0%
a situation for example um would this
include

04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
include
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
um should would this include uh Guidance
 
04:45:10.510 --> 04:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to relevant lines of
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
questioning for instance sexual history
 
04:45:15.910 --> 04:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
in a in a criminal trial there are very
 
04:45:17.430 --> 04:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
clear guidelines understood by other
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
parties about what can and cannot be
 
04:45:20.750 --> 04:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
asked I don't know that this bill
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
provides that type of guidance while it
 
04:45:25.868 --> 04:45:25.878 align:start position:0%
allows for that same kind of format of a
 
04:45:28.670 --> 04:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
hearing um and in fact allowing the
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
complainant to be the one to
 
04:45:32.830 --> 04:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
cross-examine potentially I mean I'm
 
04:45:34.350 --> 04:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
sorry allowing the respondent
 
04:45:37.150 --> 04:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
potentially be cross-examining the
 
04:45:39.550 --> 04:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
complainant um raises some concerns
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
about whether that could ret traumatize
 
04:45:46.230 --> 04:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:49.390 --> 04:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
situations I would also s um I do want
 
04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
to raise the fact that the definition of
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
student in this bill and this is
 
04:45:55.990 --> 04:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
something that could be tweaked but for
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
us we believe that that would probably
 
04:45:59.230 --> 04:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
include all of our dual and concurrent
 
04:46:00.670 --> 04:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment students these are high
 
04:46:02.310 --> 04:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
school students who do fall under the
 
04:46:03.628 --> 04:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
definition I think in this bill of
 
04:46:06.670 --> 04:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
student so I I think that we would be
 
04:46:08.788 --> 04:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
really cautious about opening up this
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill to a large high school student
 
04:46:12.550 --> 04:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
population I just don't know what that
 
04:46:14.230 --> 04:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
would look like in
 
04:46:18.990 --> 04:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
practice and I will I will stop here and
 
04:46:20.310 --> 04:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
see if there's any questions that I can
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
answer but I would also um after that
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
ask my colleagues to come up and speak
 
04:46:26.550 --> 04:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
specifically about our CBA environment
 
04:46:28.230 --> 04:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
HR environment and then the student
 
04:46:28.240 --> 04:46:30.788 align:start position:0%
HR environment and then the student
Affair

04:46:30.788 --> 04:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
side repan
 
04:46:35.230 --> 04:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
luno thank thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:46:36.990 --> 04:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much Miss Reed for
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um sort of similar to
 
04:46:42.510 --> 04:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
um to what the university system spoke
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
to in terms of the number of complaints
 
04:46:47.390 --> 04:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
they get um in a year and then leading
 
04:46:49.670 --> 04:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
to a certain number of hearings and and
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
and disciplinary action I was wondering
 
04:46:54.270 --> 04:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
if you could put that into the cont in
 
04:46:56.590 --> 04:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
similar context but in in the in the
 
04:46:59.948 --> 04:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
community college Quan context and yeah
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
and also maybe maybe also talk about any
 
04:47:05.230 --> 04:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
sort of complaint
 
04:47:08.070 --> 04:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
that that um community colleges have
 
04:47:10.510 --> 04:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
received with respect to the processes
 
04:47:12.590 --> 04:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
that you have in place today yeah thank
 
04:47:13.830 --> 04:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
you for that question I I think that
 
04:47:15.150 --> 04:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
that's best answered by my colleagues
 
04:47:16.830 --> 04:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
who deal specifically with with this as
 
04:47:19.230 --> 04:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
a part of their normal their normal work
 
04:47:19.240 --> 04:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
a part of their normal their normal work
thank

04:47:19.910 --> 04:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
you further questions Shannon we're
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
talking Community College has older
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
adults in it but you do have these
 
04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
minors do you have separate you know
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
Minor by meaning High School skids do
 
04:47:36.190 --> 04:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
you have have a process to deal with
 
04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
them by policy that are going through
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
issues maybe or
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
not well
 
04:47:47.310 --> 04:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
any legal limitations that surround
 
04:47:49.270 --> 04:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
their that adhere to their status as
 
04:47:51.910 --> 04:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
minors we would of course need to follow
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure if I'm really
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
answering your question um most of the
 
04:47:59.350 --> 04:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
minors that we serve are those dual and
 
04:48:01.310 --> 04:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment students we do
 
04:48:02.830 --> 04:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
have some students who are legitimately
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
minors on our campuses I think any any
 
04:48:06.430 --> 04:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
college would if you're if you're 18 I
 
04:48:07.708 --> 04:48:07.718 align:start position:0%
think both of my kids started college
 
04:48:12.750 --> 04:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
when they were 18 so I mean 17 um but if
 
04:48:13.830 --> 04:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
you're asking specifically about the
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
Dual and concurrent enrollment students
 
04:48:17.040 --> 04:48:18.750 align:start position:0%
Dual and concurrent enrollment students
um

04:48:18.750 --> 04:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:21.948 --> 04:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
we they they remain high school students
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
and so I'm not sure about the how it
 
04:48:28.190 --> 04:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
would work in practice to have the
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill potentially
 
04:48:31.628 --> 04:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
04:48:34.350 --> 04:48:34.360 align:start position:0%
them well I was thinking more you'd the
 
04:48:36.430 --> 04:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
high school from where they're

bargaining uh the community college

system as you know is comprised of seven
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh colleges across the state we also
 
04:49:39.150 --> 04:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
have a system office which is really a
 
04:49:42.190 --> 04:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
centralized uh business function uh we
 
04:49:45.150 --> 04:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
currently have three covered uh
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
bargaining units uh a full-time faculty
 
04:49:49.470 --> 04:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit an adjunct faculty
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit and a staff bargaining
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
unit um in each of our bargaining
 
04:49:58.990 --> 04:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
agreements uh we have a due process that
 
04:50:00.868 --> 04:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
has been negotiated uh between the
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
parties uh similar to the university
 
04:50:05.788 --> 04:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
system we a progressive disciplinary
 
04:50:09.548 --> 04:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
system um also as public employees
 
04:50:12.030 --> 04:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
public employees certainly have a
 
04:50:14.190 --> 04:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
element a significant element of due
 
04:50:16.628 --> 04:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
process which includes uh anytime we're
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
engaging in any form of conversation
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
with regards to uh some form of what
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'll call disciplinary action that
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
includes a pre-meeting where we're
 
04:50:29.070 --> 04:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
meeting with the employee we're
 
04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
reviewing uh the concerns we're asking
 
04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
for input from the employee and taking
 
04:50:35.470 --> 04:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
all of that information into
 
04:50:38.310 --> 04:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
consideration before we render any form
 
04:50:38.320 --> 04:50:39.628 align:start position:0%
consideration before we render any form
of

04:50:39.628 --> 04:50:39.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:50:42.750 --> 04:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
sanction um I would be happy to answer
 
04:50:44.270 --> 04:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have with
 
04:50:47.628 --> 04:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
regards to our due process um I would
 
04:50:50.310 --> 04:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
note that in our negotiated due process
 
04:50:52.190 --> 04:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
not only does it include grievance
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
processes where an employee has the
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
right to bring forth their concerns that
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
progresses through a higher level of
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
management within the organization a
 
04:51:02.548 --> 04:51:02.558 align:start position:0%
final step is what is an arbitration
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
process where that is an independent
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
third party reviewing uh the
 
04:51:10.350 --> 04:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances and renders a decision
 
04:51:13.510 --> 04:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:16.350 --> 04:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
binding thank you questions from the
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent Miler thank you
 
04:51:21.270 --> 04:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here um I'll ask
 
04:51:23.708 --> 04:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
you the same questions I asked UNH what
 
04:51:26.548 --> 04:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
is the what would be the impact of 1288
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
on your Collective bargain and agreement
 
04:51:30.868 --> 04:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
um I share the view of my colleagues at
 
04:51:32.670 --> 04:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
the University system and that uh it's
 
04:51:36.910 --> 04:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
an adversarial approach um a couple of
 
04:51:41.070 --> 04:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
things that uh that have caused me to be
 
04:51:45.990 --> 04:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
concerned uh one is the uh hearing
 
04:51:49.470 --> 04:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
nature uh certainly where
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh a respondent has the
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to question a complainant it
 
04:51:57.910 --> 04:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
it could create again a whole series of
 
04:52:00.510 --> 04:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
negative experiences especially if the
 
04:52:02.230 --> 04:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
situation was
 
04:52:04.350 --> 04:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
traumatic um
 
04:52:04.360 --> 04:52:06.670 align:start position:0%
traumatic um
and

04:52:06.670 --> 04:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:10.948 --> 04:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
also when as an employer if we're taking
 
04:52:13.190 --> 04:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
an action against an
 
04:52:15.390 --> 04:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
employee uh it is Management's
 
04:52:18.310 --> 04:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure that they have
 
04:52:21.510 --> 04:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
given due consideration for all of the
 
04:52:24.670 --> 04:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
facts before them um employees still
 
04:52:28.350 --> 04:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
have rights that go beyond ultimately a
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
grievance process or an arbitration
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
process um to hold management
 
04:52:38.470 --> 04:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
accountable um so those are those are my
 
04:52:41.070 --> 04:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
concerns and and we work similar again
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
to colleagues at the University system
 
04:52:46.110 --> 04:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
um we put every effort in to try to
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
resolve issues at what we've referred to
 
04:52:49.990 --> 04:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
as the lowest possible level and that
 
04:52:51.868 --> 04:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
means having conversations with our
 
04:52:54.910 --> 04:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
employees um taking opportunities to
 
04:52:57.510 --> 04:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
create an environment with our employees
 
04:53:00.430 --> 04:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
where uh circumstances that may have led
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
to an improper decision uh that there
 
04:53:05.590 --> 04:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
may be ways to remedy that and to learn
 
04:53:05.600 --> 04:53:06.548 align:start position:0%
may be ways to remedy that and to learn
from

04:53:06.548 --> 04:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:53:10.830 --> 04:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
those follow please yeah followup
 
04:53:13.150 --> 04:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
273a gives the right of the employees to
 
04:53:16.270 --> 04:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
organize and and negotiate their
 
04:53:19.670 --> 04:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
contract um and so my concern is uh how
 
04:53:22.150 --> 04:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
does this when it particularly when it
 
04:53:25.150 --> 04:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
relates to staff
 
04:53:29.470 --> 04:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
Etc does this would it would just
 
04:53:32.430 --> 04:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
subvert that right of the employee to
 
04:53:34.150 --> 04:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
have a discipline proc
 
04:53:37.110 --> 04:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
process or a due process system that's
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
in the collective bargaining agreement
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
would would this subvert that effort
 
04:53:43.350 --> 04:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
that would be the concern that I would
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
have um to some degree I think the other
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
concern point is the lack of of uh I
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
guess time frames and and timelines um
 
04:54:02.110 --> 04:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
again we work um very um judiciously to
 
04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh resolve issues but also Al to um
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
accommodate defined timelines that we've
 
04:54:07.920 --> 04:54:11.590 align:start position:0%
accommodate defined timelines that we've
negotiated

04:54:11.590 --> 04:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:14.590 --> 04:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
so uh c a question on as the bill was
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
introduced on page two says in all
 
04:54:18.990 --> 04:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings against a
 
04:54:20.670 --> 04:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
student student organization or faculty
 
04:54:22.150 --> 04:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
member the student student organization
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
or faculty member shall be entitled to a
 
04:54:26.110 --> 04:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
hearing under published procedures that
 
04:54:28.430 --> 04:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
include at a minimum all the following
 
04:54:31.190 --> 04:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
and all the rights are listed underneath
 
04:54:32.750 --> 04:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
the bill the right to this the right to
 
04:54:37.590 --> 04:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
that um are you supportive of those
 
04:54:41.070 --> 04:54:41.080 align:start position:0%
rights um I believe our process provides
 
04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
those rights um we provide individuals
 
04:54:47.948 --> 04:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
when we're taking action with the
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
determinations for whatever action that
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
is so we're providing them with the for
 
04:54:54.270 --> 04:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term evidence we're
 
04:54:55.948 --> 04:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
providing them with the opportunity to
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
refute that evidence um however um
 
04:55:04.430 --> 04:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately the
 
04:55:07.708 --> 04:55:07.718 align:start position:0%
what pauses me concerned is that hearing
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
process um the the timely timeliness
 
04:55:15.788 --> 04:55:15.798 align:start position:0%
associated with that um the lack of of I
 
04:55:18.548 --> 04:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
guess framework or guards surrounding
 
04:55:23.150 --> 04:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
that process um but as public employees
 
04:55:25.548 --> 04:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that we work very hard to
 
04:55:27.868 --> 04:55:27.878 align:start position:0%
ensure that any action that we are
 
04:55:31.470 --> 04:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
taking that ultimately the employee
 
04:55:32.910 --> 04:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
understands understands the evidence
 
04:55:34.470 --> 04:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
that we're using to take that action and
 
04:55:36.590 --> 04:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
has the opportunity to refute that thank
 
04:55:38.350 --> 04:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:46.350 --> 04:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
much go ahead sorry Oh I thought you
 
04:55:48.510 --> 04:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
working on tand go ahead so I'm Megan KH
 
04:55:49.750 --> 04:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm the vice president of students
 
04:55:51.510 --> 04:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
and Community Development at Manchester
 
04:55:54.390 --> 04:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
Community College so I can speak to the
 
04:55:56.590 --> 04:55:56.600 align:start position:0%
student experience at ccsnh in the
 
04:55:58.590 --> 04:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
community colleges a little bit and
 
04:56:00.868 --> 04:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
echoing what folks have said today I
 
04:56:03.150 --> 04:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
think that our student Judiciary process
 
04:56:05.110 --> 04:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
is absolutely laid out to provide the
 
04:56:07.708 --> 04:56:07.718 align:start position:0%
student with every instance of um
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
support they need of their ability to
 
04:56:11.830 --> 04:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
advocate for themselves their ability to
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
hear why they're in this situation what
 
04:56:16.350 --> 04:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
has happened and in fact the way that
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
our student Judiciary process is written
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
is really specifically around that idea
 
04:56:24.310 --> 04:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
of educating the student on what
 
04:56:27.990 --> 04:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
happened and why it was not helpful or
 
04:56:29.470 --> 04:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
why it went against our code of conduct
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
or why they're now in this trouble and
 
04:56:36.190 --> 04:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
helping them become a productive member
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
of our community again so it really is
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
all built around this idea of welcoming
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
them back to be a member of the
 
04:56:43.708 --> 04:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
Community College systems and I just
 
04:56:44.948 --> 04:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to read a couple of those
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
highlights so this is built into what
 
04:56:51.070 --> 04:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
our student conduct policy is um it's to
 
04:56:52.470 --> 04:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
protect the relative rights of all
 
04:56:55.070 --> 04:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
students adjudicate student behavioral
 
04:56:57.310 --> 04:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
problems in an effective Equitable and
 
04:57:00.030 --> 04:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
educational manner so again built around
 
04:57:02.548 --> 04:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
around educating with those students why
 
04:57:03.948 --> 04:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
their behavior wasn't considered
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate and then really specifically
 
04:57:08.190 --> 04:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
enabling students to learn from their
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
experiences to foresee consequences of
 
04:57:12.830 --> 04:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
the behavior and to avoid behaviors that
 
04:57:14.788 --> 04:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
would violate ethical and moral
 
04:57:17.390 --> 04:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
standards the missions of the college's
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
Judicial System shall be educational and
 
04:57:21.990 --> 04:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
emphasis so we really think that we have
 
04:57:24.510 --> 04:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
these things in place to support our
 
04:57:25.590 --> 04:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
students who are going through the
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary System like my colleagues at
 
04:57:29.868 --> 04:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
the University system have said we have
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
many different steps and the majority of
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
ours are settled at a much lower
 
04:57:35.788 --> 04:57:35.798 align:start position:0%
standard so I know there was a question
 
04:57:37.788 --> 04:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
regarding kind of the number of incid
 
04:57:39.708 --> 04:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
incidences that we deal with and I don't
 
04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
have it for the full system I can say
 
04:57:44.750 --> 04:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
that I've been with ccsnh for 10 years
 
04:57:46.830 --> 04:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
five I've been very intimately involved
 
04:57:50.150 --> 04:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the student Judiciary contuct and
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
there have not been a substantial number
 
04:57:54.350 --> 04:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
of cases that have gotten to where we're
 
04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
talking about removing a student from
 
04:57:58.948 --> 04:57:58.958 align:start position:0%
their educational experience it's very
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
important to us at the community college
 
04:58:02.510 --> 04:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
that everybody has that opportunity to
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
maintain their educational opportunities
 
04:58:05.948 --> 04:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
at the community college system so
 
04:58:07.708 --> 04:58:07.718 align:start position:0%
that's what we're working on how do we
 
04:58:10.230 --> 04:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
allow everyone to have access um and I
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
will say that I think I think another
 
04:58:15.430 --> 04:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
question uh was brought up about do we
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
have complaints about our process so for
 
04:58:21.070 --> 04:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
the students at ccsnh they can appeal
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
they have an appeals process if they
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't like the decision and one of the
 
04:58:26.190 --> 04:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
reasons they can appeal is because they
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
feel like their um their process was not
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
fair they feel like there was something
 
04:58:34.110 --> 04:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
wrong with with a process they didn't
 
04:58:35.590 --> 04:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
get notified at the right time they
 
04:58:37.270 --> 04:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
didn't get to respond something like
 
04:58:39.150 --> 04:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
that that's one of the basis is they can
 
04:58:41.350 --> 04:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
submit an appeal and we will go through
 
04:58:43.150 --> 04:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
the whole appeals process with them so I
 
04:58:46.110 --> 04:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
think that speaks to um they have a way
 
04:58:48.670 --> 04:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
to voice their concerns or complaints if
 
04:58:51.390 --> 04:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
they have them um and again that is
 
04:58:53.470 --> 04:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
really about bringing them back into
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
that educational setting um and and I
 
04:58:58.510 --> 04:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
think the other question somebody asked
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
about oh the underage students so the
 
04:59:02.390 --> 04:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
high school students uh for students
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
that are doing old who would be taking
 
04:59:06.350 --> 04:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
the classes at their local high school
 
04:59:08.270 --> 04:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
in most cases we allow this the high
 
04:59:09.868 --> 04:59:09.878 align:start position:0%
schools would take the lead on the
 
04:59:12.510 --> 04:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
Judiciary um actions or any code of
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
conduct however I think the concern here
 
04:59:17.310 --> 04:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
is that this bill would require us to
 
04:59:20.708 --> 04:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
then step in and and do things um in a
 
04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
different way than maybe the high
 
04:59:24.030 --> 04:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
schools are set up to do so it really
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
puts a double layer of um proceedings on
 
04:59:30.310 --> 04:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
the student when in most cases I think
 
04:59:32.190 --> 04:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
right now we are really set up to allow
 
04:59:33.708 --> 04:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
students to be heard
 
04:59:36.030 --> 04:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
in their home institution whether that's
 
04:59:38.110 --> 04:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
the high school or the college um so
 
04:59:39.310 --> 04:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
those were just a couple of questions I
 
04:59:42.430 --> 04:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
had jotted down um that I hope I
 
04:59:43.948 --> 04:59:43.958 align:start position:0%
answered for you if you remember that
 
04:59:45.788 --> 04:59:45.798 align:start position:0%
but anything about the student process
 
04:59:48.628 --> 04:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
at ccsnh or the community colleges um
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to to talk about thank you
 
04:59:52.990 --> 04:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much represent Miler
 
04:59:56.590 --> 04:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
04:59:59.910 --> 04:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh we heard from the UNH that there are
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
multiple or at least my interpretation
 
05:00:03.868 --> 05:00:03.878 align:start position:0%
what was said there are
 
05:00:07.230 --> 05:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
multiple uh student Judiciary governance
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
issues around campus so that you're
 
05:00:12.150 --> 05:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with kind of a peer and peer
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
review of a particular problem is there
 
05:00:16.750 --> 05:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
a similar kind of a situation that you
 
05:00:19.548 --> 05:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
have in the CCN SNH system so the
 
05:00:22.910 --> 05:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
majority of our um concerns or potential
 
05:00:24.830 --> 05:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
code of conduct complaints are going to
 
05:00:28.590 --> 05:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
be handled at that conversation level um
 
05:00:30.190 --> 05:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
it really can be split into either
 
05:00:31.310 --> 05:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
something that's a violation of the
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
student conduct or something that it's
 
05:00:34.910 --> 05:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
an academic violation so if it's
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
academic it's plagiarism it's something
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
in the classroom that's taken care of by
 
05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
academic Affairs and the faculty and
 
05:00:42.350 --> 05:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
there there's that process if it's the
 
05:00:44.788 --> 05:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
student affairs it really starts with
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
did you know this is the policy what
 
05:00:49.390 --> 05:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
happened where like what can you talk us
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
through the situation where is this
 
05:00:53.430 --> 05:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
going if it escalates to a hearing we do
 
05:00:55.150 --> 05:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
we can pull together a hearing board and
 
05:00:57.310 --> 05:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
then an appeal board as well but very
 
05:00:59.670 --> 05:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
few times is it more than that
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
conversation with the student to
 
05:01:04.750 --> 05:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
say this is not acceptable behavior in
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
this situation and the sanction is just
 
05:01:11.868 --> 05:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
a now you know we've talked about it now
 
05:01:13.868 --> 05:01:13.878 align:start position:0%
you know that this isn't you know
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
constructive or this is against the code
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
of conduct um and it's not a removal of
 
05:01:20.548 --> 05:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
it's not removing students from class
 
05:01:22.350 --> 05:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's not removing students uh we're
 
05:01:23.910 --> 05:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
fortunate the majority of us don't have
 
05:01:25.628 --> 05:01:25.638 align:start position:0%
dorms so we're not talking about dorm
 
05:01:27.390 --> 05:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
life we're not there's there's some who
 
05:01:29.708 --> 05:01:29.718 align:start position:0%
do but for the majority of us it's more
 
05:01:31.628 --> 05:01:31.638 align:start position:0%
of a when you're a member of this
 
05:01:33.310 --> 05:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
community and you're here on Camp these
 
05:01:37.350 --> 05:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
are the things that we look for so so
 
05:01:39.990 --> 05:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you so is the conversation
 
05:01:41.708 --> 05:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
that you're just related to is that
 
05:01:45.548 --> 05:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
staff to student or is there student to
 
05:01:48.110 --> 05:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
student um so it's usually not student
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
to student unless for some reason it was
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
it happened in a club meeting we do
 
05:01:53.708 --> 05:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
teach students to advocate for
 
05:01:55.270 --> 05:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
themselves so you know we've had
 
05:01:57.030 --> 05:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
situations where a student was in a club
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
meeting and said something and another
 
05:02:00.190 --> 05:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
student in that club meeting felt
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and they might come report
 
05:02:05.110 --> 05:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
that student and our conversation is
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
have you guys talked about what the
 
05:02:08.628 --> 05:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
roles of your Club is what's the norm
 
05:02:10.150 --> 05:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
for your club meetings have you had
 
05:02:11.948 --> 05:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
conversations about what is and is not
 
05:02:14.190 --> 05:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate is it just Club business or
 
05:02:15.310 --> 05:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
are you allowed to hang out and talk
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
about what you did on the weekends have
 
05:02:19.270 --> 05:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
you guys talked about what is a comfort
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
level that you guys are willing to
 
05:02:21.990 --> 05:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
discuss are you comfortable calling each
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
other out so we'll coach the students on
 
05:02:25.310 --> 05:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
having those and if they're not
 
05:02:26.470 --> 05:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable then we absolutely have
 
05:02:28.548 --> 05:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
someone from student life or a staff
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
member um or a faculty adviser help them
 
05:02:33.430 --> 05:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
with those conversations
 
05:02:35.230 --> 05:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are further
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
05:02:37.440 --> 05:02:38.948 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
very

05:02:38.948 --> 05:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
much represent Len did you have a a a
 
05:02:43.548 --> 05:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
concern or a
 
05:02:43.558 --> 05:02:46.788 align:start position:0%
concern or a
question

05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.788 --> 05:02:49.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I saw you moving around there like
 
05:02:56.270 --> 05:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:56.280 --> 05:02:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:02:58.390 --> 05:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:02:58.400 --> 05:03:00.628 align:start position:0%
yes
so

05:03:00.628 --> 05:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:05.670 --> 05:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
the I guess my the the the basic point
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
that I would make is I think it's really
 
05:03:11.230 --> 05:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that one of the
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
provisions I don't have the bill right
 
05:03:14.590 --> 05:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
in front of me now I just have the
 
05:03:16.510 --> 05:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
amendment but one of the provisions in
 
05:03:21.230 --> 05:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
the bill I believe says that um there's
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh any institution that's covered by
 
05:03:27.548 --> 05:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
this bill is is perfect it's perfectly
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
proper for them to to have processes in
 
05:03:34.788 --> 05:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
place that provide more due process
 
05:03:37.350 --> 05:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
protection than this bill what they
 
05:03:40.750 --> 05:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
can't do is provide less and so I have
 
05:03:42.628 --> 05:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
to I mean I guess one of the things I
 
05:03:45.990 --> 05:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
would I would ask you to think about is
 
05:03:50.708 --> 05:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
the various OB if if the processes that
 
05:03:52.270 --> 05:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
the community college system and the
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
university system have talked about are
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of or better than what's
 
05:04:00.150 --> 05:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
in this bill what's the problem they can
 
05:04:03.470 --> 05:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
continue to use them it seems like
 
05:04:06.030 --> 05:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
they're what they're really saying is
 
05:04:08.470 --> 05:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know there's well maybe we don't
 
05:04:11.070 --> 05:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
quite provide the due process protection
 
05:04:13.948 --> 05:04:13.958 align:start position:0%
that the Bill calls for and that's what
 
05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
we're worried about um the only and I
 
05:04:18.868 --> 05:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
give you an example the only specific
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
thing that I heard anybody talk about
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
was the time limits maybe there are some
 
05:04:25.548 --> 05:04:25.558 align:start position:0%
time limits in this bill that are
 
05:04:29.150 --> 05:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
different than um than are than the time
 
05:04:30.830 --> 05:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
limits in some collective bargaining
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
agreement or other you know if that's
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
the issue if it should be fit you know
 
05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
two weeks instead of one week or what
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
change that I I if you know maybe I I I
 
05:04:43.590 --> 05:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
certainly am not married in any sense to
 
05:04:46.030 --> 05:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
the specific time limits if it if
 
05:04:48.868 --> 05:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
there's an argument that you know uh the
 
05:04:50.628 --> 05:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
time limit should be a little greater or
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
whatever um fine make th make those
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
changes um the uh the other point that
 
05:05:01.510 --> 05:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
that I would make is first of all let me
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
just let me make two other points first
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
with regard to why does this bill refer
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
only to faculty and students or student
 
05:05:11.070 --> 05:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
organizations and not staff
 
05:05:13.590 --> 05:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
candidly uh in drafting the bill my
 
05:05:16.830 --> 05:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
concern was some of the things that have
 
05:05:18.070 --> 05:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
been going
 
05:05:21.390 --> 05:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
on uh where you know uh where people it
 
05:05:24.750 --> 05:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
just seemed uh and I'm talking generally
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
around the country where it just seemed
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
that people students or faculty members
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
were being treated unfairly uh political
 
05:05:33.670 --> 05:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
correctness was sort of the you know the
 
05:05:36.868 --> 05:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
reigning philosophy and it seemed to me
 
05:05:40.470 --> 05:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
that that the people that were uh were
 
05:05:42.670 --> 05:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
likely the targets of that were faculty
 
05:05:44.788 --> 05:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
members and students I I hadn't really
 
05:05:47.470 --> 05:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
heard much about staff and so that's why
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know but but again if the if it
 
05:05:51.948 --> 05:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
should apply to everybody if there's a
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
concern that we shouldn't have two
 
05:05:56.548 --> 05:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
system put staff in I don't I would not
 
05:05:58.110 --> 05:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
have any problem with that I just sort
 
05:06:00.590 --> 05:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
of you know I tried to focus on what I
 
05:06:04.628 --> 05:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
thought um was the problem um the other
 
05:06:06.270 --> 05:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
point that I would ask you again to
 
05:06:09.830 --> 05:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
think about on this regard is this um
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
you've heard from the various
 
05:06:15.270 --> 05:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
University people from the community
 
05:06:17.788 --> 05:06:17.798 align:start position:0%
college system and the university system
 
05:06:21.548 --> 05:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
um if this was such a bad thing
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
for faculty and staff and unions where
 
05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
are those people how come they're not
 
05:06:29.070 --> 05:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
how come you haven't had any Union
 
05:06:30.990 --> 05:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
person in here saying this is terrible
 
05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
don't do this to us um this is a you
 
05:06:35.990 --> 05:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
know you're you're taking away our
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
rights I haven't heard that and I
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
suspect that that might be that you know
 
05:06:43.190 --> 05:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't think this is so bad or
 
05:06:44.390 --> 05:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
at least they're at least they're
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
thinking that the that um they would
 
05:06:50.430 --> 05:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
have the the the the rights that are G
 
05:06:51.470 --> 05:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
granted under their collective
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement would be the
 
05:06:54.628 --> 05:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
collect would be would be equivalent and
 
05:06:55.948 --> 05:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
there'd be no problem they can continue
 
05:06:57.788 --> 05:06:57.798 align:start position:0%
to follow what's provided under their
 
05:07:00.270 --> 05:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements so I
 
05:07:00.280 --> 05:07:01.190 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements so I
guess

05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
guess
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
those uh
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
are some of the things that I would that
 
05:07:06.350 --> 05:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to think about the last
 
05:07:09.150 --> 05:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
point that I would make is it you know
 
05:07:11.628 --> 05:07:11.638 align:start position:0%
it it says in the in the definition of
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceeding disciplinary
 
05:07:17.470 --> 05:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding means an action or proceeding
 
05:07:19.548 --> 05:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
instituted I don't think that the you
 
05:07:21.310 --> 05:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
know to the extent that there was this
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh the the concerns raised about well we
 
05:07:28.350 --> 05:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
you know we have a collaborative process
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
we first try to talk to someone um I
 
05:07:33.150 --> 05:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
don't see how that
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
is how anything in this interferes with
 
05:07:38.830 --> 05:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
that that's not the beginning of a of a
 
05:07:41.150 --> 05:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh of a proceeding to suspend someone
 
05:07:42.628 --> 05:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
that's I mean I guess the equivalent
 
05:07:46.548 --> 05:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
would be in the uh in the uh you know in
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
the criminal law context if a policeman
 
05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
walks up to you and and and starts to
 
05:07:54.830 --> 05:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
talk to you um raising some some
 
05:07:57.070 --> 05:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
question about you know I you know I'm
 
05:07:59.430 --> 05:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
not quite sure why you're in this area
 
05:08:01.548 --> 05:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
what you're doing that doesn't start a
 
05:08:03.670 --> 05:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
criminal proced meeting if they issue
 
05:08:05.470 --> 05:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
you some kind of a ticket or whatever or
 
05:08:07.070 --> 05:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
they arrest you obviously but if they
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
issue you some kind of a some kind of a
 
05:08:12.190 --> 05:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
ticket that starts a proceeding so I
 
05:08:14.628 --> 05:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
don't see how any of the I mean I think
 
05:08:16.990 --> 05:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
the idea that the col the collaborative
 
05:08:18.390 --> 05:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
process that they're talking about that
 
05:08:20.548 --> 05:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
all sounds fine to me and I don't see
 
05:08:23.390 --> 05:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
how anything in this Pro in this is in
 
05:08:26.708 --> 05:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
any way inconsistent with that so anyway
 
05:08:30.070 --> 05:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh thank
 
05:08:34.510 --> 05:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
you R Miler yeah thank you I you know I
 
05:08:37.548 --> 05:08:37.558 align:start position:0%
guess I go back to why was this filed I
 
05:08:41.070 --> 05:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
mean was there an incident was there uh
 
05:08:44.150 --> 05:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
history I mean we we've heard from OB
 
05:08:45.948 --> 05:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
obviously we've heard the institutional
 
05:08:48.190 --> 05:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
voice there's no question about that
 
05:08:51.670 --> 05:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
sure and so I I mean we we we this is
 
05:08:54.510 --> 05:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with due process we've heard
 
05:08:55.990 --> 05:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's collective bargaining there's a
 
05:08:57.750 --> 05:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
grievance procedures an arbitration
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
procedure there's student uh there's
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
student reviews of issues why why was
 
05:09:03.910 --> 05:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
this brought forward was was there
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
something that initiated this or was
 
05:09:09.030 --> 05:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
just or was this just a philosophic
 
05:09:10.670 --> 05:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
issues that I think this would be good
 
05:09:12.990 --> 05:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
to have right so can you clarify for me
 
05:09:15.030 --> 05:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
sure no I think I mean I think that as I
 
05:09:17.230 --> 05:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
said before I think the the the issue
 
05:09:20.190 --> 05:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
that prompts this is the kind of things
 
05:09:22.948 --> 05:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
that we've seen going on around the
 
05:09:26.628 --> 05:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
country with you know uh faculty members
 
05:09:28.470 --> 05:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
or students or student organizations
 
05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
being kind of cancelled um uh and and
 
05:09:35.788 --> 05:09:35.798 align:start position:0%
things that we've seen um uh you know
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
coming out of um first the the Obama
 
05:09:41.510 --> 05:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
Administration then it was canceled
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
under the Trump Administration and now
 
05:09:45.548 --> 05:09:45.558 align:start position:0%
apparently there at least some some uh
 
05:09:48.590 --> 05:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
effort to restore it uh in the Biden
 
05:09:52.270 --> 05:09:52.280 align:start position:0%
administration of uh you know kind of
 
05:09:55.510 --> 05:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
cutting back on the uh the processes
 
05:09:57.910 --> 05:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
that are fored students who were accused
 
05:10:00.190 --> 05:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
and I you know I can't help I can't help
 
05:10:02.350 --> 05:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
notice that one of the prior people who
 
05:10:04.670 --> 05:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
spoke to you just a few moments ago
 
05:10:06.548 --> 05:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
talked about a concern about well if we
 
05:10:06.558 --> 05:10:07.910 align:start position:0%
talked about a concern about well if we
allow

05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
allow
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
cross-examination uh uh a complainant
 
05:10:11.548 --> 05:10:11.558 align:start position:0%
might be
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
traumatized well you know that uh is
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
that a legitimate concern yeah but I
 
05:10:18.590 --> 05:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't hear her say that we
 
05:10:20.510 --> 05:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
should be concerned about whether
 
05:10:23.548 --> 05:10:23.558 align:start position:0%
somebody had been improperly accused and
 
05:10:27.190 --> 05:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have the the the the the right to
 
05:10:29.948 --> 05:10:29.958 align:start position:0%
cross-examine to basically assert
 
05:10:31.628 --> 05:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
establish that he was that he was
 
05:10:31.638 --> 05:10:32.670 align:start position:0%
establish that he was that he was
innocent

05:10:32.670 --> 05:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
innocent
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
so you know it's and I don't please
 
05:10:36.430 --> 05:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
understand I don't fault the prior
 
05:10:37.868 --> 05:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
witness for that at all traum
 
05:10:41.628 --> 05:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
traumatization of of uh of of uh victim
 
05:10:44.590 --> 05:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
is certainly a legitimate concern but I
 
05:10:47.430 --> 05:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
think you know it's a two-way street and
 
05:10:51.270 --> 05:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
and part of the the fact that you focus
 
05:10:55.190 --> 05:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
on traumatization of the victim uh but
 
05:10:57.628 --> 05:10:57.638 align:start position:0%
don't sort of consider the other side of
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
the equation that's the problem I think
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
that that is why this kind of this kind
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
of uh legislation is needed because
 
05:11:09.390 --> 05:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
there are you know from from 27 years of
 
05:11:12.750 --> 05:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
serving as a judge there are two sides
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
to the story um and and you have to be
 
05:11:19.270 --> 05:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
concerned with both sides of the story
 
05:11:21.868 --> 05:11:21.878 align:start position:0%
just as a followup believe me if I've
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
learned anything in my life that is
 
05:11:25.990 --> 05:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
there are two sides of every story and
 
05:11:27.788 --> 05:11:27.798 align:start position:0%
you need to know both both sides I
 
05:11:30.070 --> 05:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
understand that but you talk about a
 
05:11:32.150 --> 05:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
national culture that you're concerned
 
05:11:36.750 --> 05:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
with in this state are there issues that
 
05:11:39.548 --> 05:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
prompted this piece of legislation as a
 
05:11:41.788 --> 05:11:41.798 align:start position:0%
result of actions that have been taken
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
by the University or whatever in this
 
05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
state I you know I can't I can tell you
 
05:11:51.030 --> 05:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
that I have heard sort of General kind
 
05:11:52.590 --> 05:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
of complaints but I can't give you a
 
05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
specific like this happened on this date
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
no I cannot give you that thank you very
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
much yes representa
 
05:12:02.310 --> 05:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um I worked briefly in
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
a college um as a Adjunct
 
05:12:09.310 --> 05:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
professor and I was in the wellness I
 
05:12:13.230 --> 05:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
taught wellness and health and um one of
 
05:12:15.030 --> 05:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
the most delicate issues that comes up
 
05:12:17.910 --> 05:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
at colleges I in my opinion is sexual
 
05:12:21.270 --> 05:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
assault and I kind of think it's the
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
hidden elephant in the room today uh
 
05:12:26.270 --> 05:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
that we're talking around that when you
 
05:12:30.670 --> 05:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
talk about Obama Trump Biden I think
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about title n
 
05:12:34.510 --> 05:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think you're talking about
 
05:12:38.868 --> 05:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
sexual assault on campus um and I think
 
05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:12:44.110 --> 05:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh that that the
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
general the general way it's handled at
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
colleges has to be very very delicate um
 
05:12:55.390 --> 05:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
very delicate because a lot of times the
 
05:12:57.430 --> 05:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
victim doesn't want to press
 
05:13:00.510 --> 05:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
charges uh but obviously they
 
05:13:03.788 --> 05:13:03.798 align:start position:0%
can't think can't just go on campus just
 
05:13:07.948 --> 05:13:07.958 align:start position:0%
as they always have um and the person
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
who's the perpetrator sometimes is um
 
05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
totally clueless not totally clueless
 
05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
but um was drunk or uh really didn't
 
05:13:21.868 --> 05:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
know have much training or anything on
 
05:13:25.390 --> 05:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
consent um beforehand so I think when we
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
05:13:30.350 --> 05:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
traumatizing victims through the
 
05:13:33.150 --> 05:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
perpetrator or the person that's accused
 
05:13:35.548 --> 05:13:35.558 align:start position:0%
cross-examining them I mean that would
 
05:13:37.548 --> 05:13:37.558 align:start position:0%
be horrific in the case of sexual
 
05:13:40.470 --> 05:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
assault and on most of the ca well at
 
05:13:42.310 --> 05:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
least my understanding is that a lot of
 
05:13:45.670 --> 05:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
campuses have specific guidelines set up
 
05:13:49.390 --> 05:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
for sexual assault and specific uh ways
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
to deal with it um that this due process
 
05:13:55.708 --> 05:13:55.718 align:start position:0%
um that you have in this bill would
 
05:13:58.190 --> 05:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
really interfere with it and I I'm very
 
05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
opposed to it thank you well I guess the
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
only I could say in respon
 
05:14:03.030 --> 05:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative and I say this
 
05:14:06.670 --> 05:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully but you know that
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
um the traumatization that you're
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
talking about um could could it exist
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
yes but I don't think that that what
 
05:14:20.548 --> 05:14:20.558 align:start position:0%
follows from that is that we can we can
 
05:14:22.590 --> 05:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
just assume that what if it didn't
 
05:14:24.788 --> 05:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
happen what if the what if in fact the
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
person is innocent isn't that the reason
 
05:14:30.868 --> 05:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
that you have cross-examination because
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
I mean that that's the whole point of
 
05:14:36.350 --> 05:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
the of of you know our system we don't
 
05:14:38.590 --> 05:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
you know we don't how how however much
 
05:14:40.948 --> 05:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
we may feel for someone we don't we
 
05:14:42.990 --> 05:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't say well we'll just you know the
 
05:14:45.830 --> 05:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
victim must be believed that's I'm sorry
 
05:14:48.350 --> 05:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
but that's just not true the victim you
 
05:14:51.030 --> 05:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
know the victim may very well in many
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
cases be telling the truth and the and
 
05:14:54.990 --> 05:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator should be punished I
 
05:14:58.948 --> 05:14:58.958 align:start position:0%
have no doubt about that um but we can't
 
05:15:01.788 --> 05:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
just assume that that's true because
 
05:15:04.548 --> 05:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
there you know it may be the case that
 
05:15:06.190 --> 05:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
the that the person that's accused is
 
05:15:08.670 --> 05:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
innocent and should have an opportunity
 
05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that and that
 
05:15:12.868 --> 05:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
cross-examination is you know from time
 
05:15:14.990 --> 05:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
immemorial has been one of the one of
 
05:15:17.670 --> 05:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
the you know ways in which that's done
 
05:15:20.430 --> 05:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
is through is through cross-examination
 
05:15:20.440 --> 05:15:22.150 align:start position:0%
is through is through cross-examination
so

05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:26.548 --> 05:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
yes so I I can't remember the exact
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
statistics but it's overwhelmingly that
 
05:15:32.310 --> 05:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
most people who are victim of sexual
 
05:15:34.948 --> 05:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
assault don't don't go to a criminal
 
05:15:37.390 --> 05:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
level and the reason they don't go to a
 
05:15:37.400 --> 05:15:38.670 align:start position:0%
level and the reason they don't go to a
criminal

05:15:38.670 --> 05:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
05:15:41.030 --> 05:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
level for well there's several reasons
 
05:15:42.948 --> 05:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
they don't go to a criminal level but at
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
at when you're in your 20s or late
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
teens you know it whatever happens is
 
05:15:52.628 --> 05:15:52.638 align:start position:0%
going to affect both those people both
 
05:15:54.990 --> 05:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
parties tremendously for the rest of
 
05:15:58.948 --> 05:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
their lives and so the more can be
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
handled at a local situation
 
05:16:04.510 --> 05:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
um involving maybe even parents at that
 
05:16:07.350 --> 05:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
level uh but certainly people who know
 
05:16:10.470 --> 05:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
crisis centers who know how to handle it
 
05:16:13.910 --> 05:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I think to then throw in due process
 
05:16:16.150 --> 05:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
and criminal law you're just you're
 
05:16:20.030 --> 05:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
you're making a bad situation unbearable
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
so that would be my point no I you know
 
05:16:24.548 --> 05:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
I'm with you I I think I'm probably with
 
05:16:28.990 --> 05:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
you 9 to 90% of the way but but where it
 
05:16:31.788 --> 05:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
where I would draw the line is if that
 
05:16:34.150 --> 05:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know sort of informal kind of we're
 
05:16:36.430 --> 05:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
going to talk about it kind of
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
collaboratively if the bottom line of
 
05:16:41.510 --> 05:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
that is the student is being s you know
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
here suspended if that's the bottom line
 
05:16:47.430 --> 05:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
then it seems to me that that's that's
 
05:16:49.868 --> 05:16:49.878 align:start position:0%
where the student the accused student
 
05:16:51.990 --> 05:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
and obviously the student can wave any
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
of these there's no reason that I think
 
05:16:55.708 --> 05:16:55.718 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically says that student
 
05:16:58.510 --> 05:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
can wave a student or faculty member can
 
05:17:00.310 --> 05:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
wave all of these things if he wants to
 
05:17:03.750 --> 05:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
or she wants to but if they don't do
 
05:17:05.708 --> 05:17:05.718 align:start position:0%
that and the bottom line is the students
 
05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to be suspended it seems to me
 
05:17:10.470 --> 05:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
that there is where the student has a
 
05:17:13.628 --> 05:17:13.638 align:start position:0%
right to say wait a minute you know um
 
05:17:16.548 --> 05:17:16.558 align:start position:0%
I've got I have some rights here too and
 
05:17:18.670 --> 05:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
yes the rights are less than would be
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
the case in a criminal trial where proof
 
05:17:21.868 --> 05:17:21.878 align:start position:0%
had to be Beyond A Reasonable Doubt and
 
05:17:25.350 --> 05:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's a public trial and all that sure um
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
but to just say you
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
know you don't have any right to sort of
 
05:17:31.948 --> 05:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
defend yourself
 
05:17:34.470 --> 05:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
that I have a problem with that I I
 
05:17:35.750 --> 05:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't think they ever say that they
 
05:17:38.548 --> 05:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
don't have any could be a question sorry
 
05:17:40.708 --> 05:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
okay um are there any other questions
 
05:17:43.310 --> 05:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
for representative Lynn right
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
now represent thank you very much
 
05:17:48.150 --> 05:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative papovich uh Muller you
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
you had your hand out extremely brief
 
05:17:56.350 --> 05:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman I just wanted
 
05:17:58.430 --> 05:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
to be again extremely brief because you
 
05:18:00.150 --> 05:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
know we spent a lot of time on this and
 
05:18:02.990 --> 05:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
frankly I learned quite a few things
 
05:18:06.190 --> 05:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
here I'm not a co-sponsor of this bill
 
05:18:08.990 --> 05:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
but in my view one of the benefits of
 
05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
this bill is that it would protect our
 
05:18:13.310 --> 05:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
universities which currently are
 
05:18:16.548 --> 05:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
required to conduct investigations with
 
05:18:18.990 --> 05:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
standards that could result
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
in bad decisions and I uh while I was
 
05:18:24.830 --> 05:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
waiting there and researching stuff I
 
05:18:27.390 --> 05:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
just found a December 23 article in the
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia Inquirer about a $15
 
05:18:32.590 --> 05:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
million award to a
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
doctor against Thomas Jefferson
 
05:18:37.350 --> 05:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
University because of the outcome of a
 
05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
title 9 investigation that was conducted
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
according to those rules resulted in an
 
05:18:45.510 --> 05:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
incorrect decision and uh you know the
 
05:18:48.030 --> 05:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
courts then created a massive Financial
 
05:18:49.590 --> 05:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
liability against the university in
 
05:18:52.910 --> 05:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
question right now universities have so
 
05:18:54.708 --> 05:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
many rules on how quickly they have to
 
05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
do things and how to do things creating
 
05:18:59.310 --> 05:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
this clear legal standard at the state
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
level would give them a clear way to do
 
05:19:04.990 --> 05:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
it which would also protect them against
 
05:19:07.030 --> 05:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
those types of outcomes and I'd be happy
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
to send um you know link to that
 
05:19:11.590 --> 05:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
particular article to uh you know the
 
05:19:13.150 --> 05:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
committee just for your information so
 
05:19:14.750 --> 05:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
you can review it I don't want to take a
 
05:19:16.548 --> 05:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
lot of your time but I just wanted to
 
05:19:19.190 --> 05:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
share that point of view on this Bill
 
05:19:21.510 --> 05:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
05:19:23.900 --> 05:19:23.910 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you yes
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:25.990 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you yes

05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:19:28.350 --> 05:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
Shannon I just just very briefly I feel
 
05:19:31.030 --> 05:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
like I need to clarify um something that
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
I said said earlier were that the
 
05:19:35.070 --> 05:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor alluded to and I I certainly did
 
05:19:38.030 --> 05:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
not intend in any way to prioritize the
 
05:19:39.510 --> 05:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
the rights or position of the
 
05:19:41.390 --> 05:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
complainant over the respondent but my
 
05:19:44.030 --> 05:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
my point was more in giving the uh
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
respondent the right in this bill to
 
05:19:48.708 --> 05:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
confront and cross-examine um does that
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
does that respondent understand legal
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
guard rails that that would be in place
 
05:19:55.590 --> 05:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
in a in a courtroom proceeding for
 
05:19:58.150 --> 05:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
example what can be asked what can't be
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
asked what's what's kind of fair game
 
05:20:02.270 --> 05:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
and what isn't um the right to
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
cross-examine the right to um explore
 
05:20:07.548 --> 05:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
and interrogate the the information and
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
and whatever evidence has been brought
 
05:20:10.910 --> 05:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
forth is certainly something that
 
05:20:13.670 --> 05:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
happens in the context of our existing
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
um procedures and processes but it's not
 
05:20:20.670 --> 05:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
the um kind of layman if you will who's
 
05:20:22.350 --> 05:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
who's doing it it's someone who who
 
05:20:23.910 --> 05:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
understands what those rules
 
05:20:26.070 --> 05:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
are thank
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much is there anybody
 
05:20:32.510 --> 05:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
else who wanted to speak on this bill
 
05:20:34.230 --> 05:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so we're going to move on now
 
05:20:37.190 --> 05:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
to the next bill which we had 1305 which
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
is freedom of speech and
 
05:20:41.350 --> 05:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
Association at public institutions of
 
05:20:41.360 --> 05:20:45.150 align:start position:0%
Association at public institutions of
higher

05:20:45.150 --> 05:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:45.160 --> 05:20:52.270 align:start position:0%
 
education

05:20:52.270 --> 05:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:55.110 --> 05:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
yep thank you Mr chair I really have a
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
very short um statement to make
 
05:21:01.590 --> 05:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
basically two two things one is that
 
05:21:04.150 --> 05:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
um during the initial hearings I was
 
05:21:05.590 --> 05:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
under the impression because the bill
 
05:21:07.390 --> 05:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
had an extension that it was a two
 
05:21:09.510 --> 05:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee bill I learned later what the
 
05:21:10.910 --> 05:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee already knows that it is a
 
05:21:12.990 --> 05:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
single committee Bill I just wanted to
 
05:21:14.830 --> 05:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
correct that misstatement on the record
 
05:21:17.070 --> 05:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
since I misspoke the first time not
 
05:21:20.270 --> 05:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
knowing what the situation was the other
 
05:21:22.350 --> 05:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
thing that I wanted to share was
 
05:21:26.948 --> 05:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
that excuse me I did spend time talking
 
05:21:29.510 --> 05:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
to the um Office of the civil rights of
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General and we were able to
 
05:21:34.670 --> 05:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
agree on language that would um address
 
05:21:37.190 --> 05:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
the concerns they expressed um as as
 
05:21:39.548 --> 05:21:39.558 align:start position:0%
feedback to the bill that amendment has
 
05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
been filed withs I I hope it will be
 
05:21:44.510 --> 05:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
ready by the end of tomorrow and as soon
 
05:21:46.030 --> 05:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
as it is ready I will share it to the
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
committee other than that I'm just here
 
05:21:49.750 --> 05:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
to be available if anybody has questions
 
05:21:52.470 --> 05:21:52.480 align:start position:0%

05:21:54.990 --> 05:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
make thank you very much yeah when you
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%

speak on the freedom of speech freedom
 
05:22:15.750 --> 05:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
of association
 
05:22:15.760 --> 05:22:17.628 align:start position:0%
of association
bill

05:22:17.628 --> 05:22:17.638 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:22:20.150 --> 05:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
yes I I'll be very very brief since I
 
05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
talked to and at you about this at at
 
05:22:23.670 --> 05:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
enormous length first of all I just want
 
05:22:26.190 --> 05:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
to say I want to thank um representative
 
05:22:27.788 --> 05:22:27.798 align:start position:0%
Papa M for working with the Attorney
 
05:22:29.230 --> 05:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
General's office on the definition of
 
05:22:32.030 --> 05:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
harassment that was one of our concerns
 
05:22:33.430 --> 05:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh we'll look to see what comes out but
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
we just want to say publicly thank you
 
05:22:36.190 --> 05:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
to the representative for having done
 
05:22:41.270 --> 05:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
that um and uh beyond that the other
 
05:22:43.230 --> 05:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
challenges that we've identified sort of
 
05:22:44.548 --> 05:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
still remain we're happy to answer
 
05:22:46.230 --> 05:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
questions about any of them the one
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
point we haven't made in a while um and
 
05:22:50.350 --> 05:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
before and I just want to raise again
 
05:22:53.708 --> 05:22:53.718 align:start position:0%
now is um we've just had an extensive
 
05:22:55.628 --> 05:22:55.638 align:start position:0%
discussion about that last bill two
 
05:22:58.030 --> 05:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
process this bill has now been heard U
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
at public hearing twice in two years and
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
the study session
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
um if you add it all up the combined
 
05:23:05.190 --> 05:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
time of the committee that's been put
 
05:23:07.628 --> 05:23:07.638 align:start position:0%
into the bill is I it's going to be 60
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
odd hours at this point um on this bill
 
05:23:11.990 --> 05:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the things you're
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's challenging to
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
find the right way to strike the balance
 
05:23:16.590 --> 05:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
on these things because once you drill
 
05:23:19.270 --> 05:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
down to these issues that affect kind of
 
05:23:21.390 --> 05:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
low-level University operational things
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
like how do we manage our student clubs
 
05:23:27.190 --> 05:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
and how do we issue permits um they're
 
05:23:28.548 --> 05:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
kind of getting down into the weeds and
 
05:23:32.430 --> 05:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that if you look at uh
 
05:23:36.470 --> 05:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
187a um the legislature a long time ago
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
made a statement that in general it's
 
05:23:39.708 --> 05:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
going to leave those issues to the Board
 
05:23:41.670 --> 05:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
of Trustees of the University system and
 
05:23:43.030 --> 05:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
I think it does it for two reasons one
 
05:23:46.030 --> 05:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
is because um I know if we express some
 
05:23:47.548 --> 05:23:47.558 align:start position:0%
concern I've heard concerns from from
 
05:23:49.190 --> 05:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
the sponsor about how well the people
 
05:23:51.868 --> 05:23:51.878 align:start position:0%
running UNH change all the time so the
 
05:23:53.070 --> 05:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
people running the state change
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes too and it's hard for us to
 
05:23:56.670 --> 05:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
respond to the competing calls but the
 
05:23:59.350 --> 05:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
other part of it is this is one very
 
05:24:00.830 --> 05:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
small part of the University's
 
05:24:02.350 --> 05:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
Administration and this committee has
 
05:24:04.310 --> 05:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
already had to SN a lot of hours of its
 
05:24:06.590 --> 05:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
time into it and I think that's why the
 
05:24:09.150 --> 05:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
legislature those many decades ago made
 
05:24:10.470 --> 05:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
the decision that they're going to
 
05:24:11.948 --> 05:24:11.958 align:start position:0%
offload a lot of that to the Board of
 
05:24:13.470 --> 05:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
Trustees and I think if the if the
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
committee decided that it was going to
 
05:24:16.350 --> 05:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
rest on that decision that the
 
05:24:19.270 --> 05:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
legislature made that time ago to leave
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
these sorts of matters to the Board of
 
05:24:22.110 --> 05:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
Trustees it would be consistent with how
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's treated similar matters in the past
 
05:24:25.708 --> 05:24:25.718 align:start position:0%
and now I will genuinely be quiet and
 
05:24:26.990 --> 05:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
stop saying a single more word about
 
05:24:29.350 --> 05:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
this bill unless
 
05:24:33.270 --> 05:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
asked questions from the committee uh in
 
05:24:37.390 --> 05:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
the last several months college campus
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
has gone through a a lot of difficult
 
05:24:42.750 --> 05:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
times dealing with freedom of
 
05:24:45.868 --> 05:24:45.878 align:start position:0%
speech however it's been fairly settled
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
at UNH can you tell me
 
05:24:51.868 --> 05:24:51.878 align:start position:0%
why I think it's a combination of things
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
um one is I you heard from Chief Dean uh
 
05:24:56.470 --> 05:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
when he was here to testify I think he
 
05:24:58.230 --> 05:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
and his team do a very good job of
 
05:25:00.070 --> 05:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
working with events on campus to make
 
05:25:02.110 --> 05:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
sure that people get heard but that
 
05:25:04.470 --> 05:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
things sort of stay people caller inside
 
05:25:06.590 --> 05:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
the lines the other part and this is
 
05:25:08.230 --> 05:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
down partially the person in the seat I
 
05:25:09.830 --> 05:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
will admit but there's been a real
 
05:25:11.948 --> 05:25:11.958 align:start position:0%
institutional commitment to it um going
 
05:25:14.270 --> 05:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
back a number of years now um right down
 
05:25:15.708 --> 05:25:15.718 align:start position:0%
to working with fire to rewrite all of
 
05:25:17.150 --> 05:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
our policies to make sure that they
 
05:25:18.548 --> 05:25:18.558 align:start position:0%
lined up with what fire was hoping to
 
05:25:20.830 --> 05:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
see um and so I think what you're seeing
 
05:25:24.110 --> 05:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
is the outcome of a commitment to
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
creating policies and practices that
 
05:25:28.190 --> 05:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
facilitate speech without about
 
05:25:30.750 --> 05:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
minimizing disruption and honestly
 
05:25:34.030 --> 05:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
willingness by the Board of Trustees and
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
the administration to um withstand the
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
pressure that comes from folks who are
 
05:25:40.830 --> 05:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
unhappy when speech happens they
 
05:25:40.840 --> 05:25:41.948 align:start position:0%
unhappy when speech happens they
disagree

05:25:41.948 --> 05:25:41.958 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
05:25:45.150 --> 05:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
with thank you any further questions
 
05:25:46.070 --> 05:25:46.080 align:start position:0%

okay okay thank you Mr chair members of
 
05:26:13.788 --> 05:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record uh
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative Mike beler Carol District
 
05:26:19.590 --> 05:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
4 um so we were we were here and we
 
05:26:21.670 --> 05:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
heard our the original testimony on this
 
05:26:24.948 --> 05:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
bill during the hearing we heard from a
 
05:26:27.070 --> 05:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
student who was a member of a
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
conservative oriented student
 
05:26:30.830 --> 05:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
organization who participated in a
 
05:26:32.990 --> 05:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
two-person tabling event that was not
 
05:26:35.310 --> 05:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
permanent uh he testified that the event
 
05:26:38.070 --> 05:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
was shut down by the university when the
 
05:26:39.750 --> 05:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
university testified we did in fact
 
05:26:42.110 --> 05:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
learn that this was their policy that
 
05:26:45.670 --> 05:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
any unper events um are not allowed to
 
05:26:47.350 --> 05:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
go forward that you require to get a
 
05:26:49.510 --> 05:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
permanent headed time for these events
 
05:26:52.030 --> 05:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
as a part of that uh hearing I requested
 
05:26:54.310 --> 05:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
information I received information the
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
database of permits issued for
 
05:27:00.030 --> 05:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
2023 um in this per in this database I
 
05:27:02.310 --> 05:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
identifi one event that was not
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
permitted yet it was nonetheless allowed
 
05:27:06.070 --> 05:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
to go forward it was a rather large
 
05:27:08.590 --> 05:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
event uh it was in the tragic aftermath
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
of the shooting in Lewiston um but this
 
05:27:13.628 --> 05:27:13.638 align:start position:0%
again this is an unpent event that was
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to go forward uh despite not
 
05:27:19.510 --> 05:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
having received pyro approval we've
 
05:27:21.390 --> 05:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
heard other testimony to that effect in
 
05:27:23.708 --> 05:27:23.718 align:start position:0%
this committee as well uh further in
 
05:27:26.030 --> 05:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
this database there were six um out of
 
05:27:27.270 --> 05:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of permits issued there
 
05:27:31.270 --> 05:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
were six permits indicating um that uh
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
amplification of sound was requested of
 
05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
those six four were requested by
 
05:27:38.470 --> 05:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
Evangelical Christian organizations and
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
two requested by uh Pro Palestinian
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
organizations of the Evangelical
 
05:27:44.270 --> 05:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
Christian organizations all four were
 
05:27:47.548 --> 05:27:47.558 align:start position:0%
denied one of the two uh prop
 
05:27:50.868 --> 05:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
Palestinian were approved um they may
 
05:27:52.470 --> 05:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
make the case that this was they were
 
05:27:55.708 --> 05:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
concerned about um some sort of
 
05:27:57.548 --> 05:27:57.558 align:start position:0%
disturbance however I would note that
 
05:28:00.510 --> 05:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
the second uh uh event that was approved
 
05:28:02.830 --> 05:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
it was the prop Palestinian protest that
 
05:28:04.788 --> 05:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
was approved for amplication
 
05:28:06.708 --> 05:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
amplification despite the fact that a
 
05:28:09.470 --> 05:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
prior event of the same sort had
 
05:28:12.070 --> 05:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
resulted in considerable controversy and
 
05:28:13.910 --> 05:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
a rebuke from the governor even now
 
05:28:15.430 --> 05:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's not my concern as far as free
 
05:28:16.948 --> 05:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
speech goes I think free speech is Free
 
05:28:19.230 --> 05:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
Speech but it very seriously undermines
 
05:28:20.590 --> 05:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
any argument that the other
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
organizations were denied
 
05:28:24.430 --> 05:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
amplification because they were afraid
 
05:28:27.030 --> 05:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
of disruption lastly there was another
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
event um the only event in the entire
 
05:28:31.590 --> 05:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
database that I discovered covered uh
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
that required extra scrutiny because to
 
05:28:37.270 --> 05:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
the extent that they had to consult with
 
05:28:39.070 --> 05:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
a detective on the force about it
 
05:28:41.670 --> 05:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
because apparently it had received um
 
05:28:44.788 --> 05:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
complaints from students uh this as well
 
05:28:47.350 --> 05:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
was a conservative uh Christian
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
organization looking to do Evangel U
 
05:28:51.350 --> 05:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
evangelism on
 
05:28:54.948 --> 05:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
campus um and this again is despite the
 
05:28:58.070 --> 05:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
fact that there were Untold numbers of
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
events uh labeled um
 
05:29:03.510 --> 05:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
sex toy popup demonstrations that
 
05:29:06.270 --> 05:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
apparently required absolutely no extra
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
scrutiny to approve so it would be my um
 
05:29:13.110 --> 05:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
belief that this database that I I
 
05:29:15.548 --> 05:29:15.558 align:start position:0%
believe I provided previously um
 
05:29:17.910 --> 05:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
contains incontrovertible evidence of
 
05:29:21.190 --> 05:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
viewpoint based discrimination at UNH
 
05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
despite their fire record being good at
 
05:29:24.240 --> 05:29:24.990 align:start position:0%
despite their fire record being good at
the

05:29:24.990 --> 05:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
moment thank you thank you are there
 
05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
questions of the
 
05:29:29.320 --> 05:29:30.830 align:start position:0%
questions of the
representative

05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%

Cronin

05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
Cronin
 
05:29:42.670 --> 05:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
yeah good afternoon again Tom cron with
 
05:29:44.590 --> 05:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
the university system uh so thanks to
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative beler uh for pointing
 
05:29:47.628 --> 05:29:47.638 align:start position:0%
some of those out I just thought it'd be
 
05:29:49.470 --> 05:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
helpful to respond as we discussed in
 
05:29:50.708 --> 05:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
the last year and two sides to every
 
05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
story um during the hearing you heard
 
05:29:54.390 --> 05:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
from a student who was working with
 
05:29:56.470 --> 05:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity who testified
 
05:29:58.270 --> 05:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
that they were not given immediate
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
approval to set up a uh table to handout
 
05:30:03.910 --> 05:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
literature I think you also recall that
 
05:30:06.110 --> 05:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
student saying within 2 days they were
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
given approval to handout literature and
 
05:30:10.990 --> 05:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
there are at least four occasions within
 
05:30:13.070 --> 05:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
the permitting documents uh of Americans
 
05:30:14.990 --> 05:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
for Prosperity being able to do exactly
 
05:30:17.070 --> 05:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
what that student was asking for
 
05:30:19.310 --> 05:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity is at present
 
05:30:21.030 --> 05:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
not a recognized student organization so
 
05:30:22.670 --> 05:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
there are different rules that govern
 
05:30:24.350 --> 05:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
when total third parties to the
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
university come to the university and
 
05:30:29.390 --> 05:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
are given permission to hand out uh
 
05:30:31.030 --> 05:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
evangelize as the the representative
 
05:30:32.390 --> 05:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
spoke and other things but I think it's
 
05:30:33.868 --> 05:30:33.878 align:start position:0%
pretty clear through here that once
 
05:30:35.910 --> 05:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
asked uh the university is is very
 
05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
forthcoming in terms of allowing outside
 
05:30:39.628 --> 05:30:39.638 align:start position:0%
groups to share information with our
 
05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
students amplification is a time place
 
05:30:43.070 --> 05:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
and manner restriction which we've
 
05:30:44.990 --> 05:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
talked about a lot within uh the context
 
05:30:46.830 --> 05:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill the situations the
 
05:30:48.750 --> 05:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned the one that
 
05:30:51.150 --> 05:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
was approved that group specifically
 
05:30:53.230 --> 05:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
moved from directly in front of Thompson
 
05:30:54.430 --> 05:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
Hall folks who are famili with the
 
05:30:55.510 --> 05:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
university know that is the m
 
05:30:57.310 --> 05:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
administration building is right next to
 
05:30:58.750 --> 05:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
our library and is right next to an
 
05:31:01.070 --> 05:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
academic building they move from that
 
05:31:03.470 --> 05:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
facility across the street into what we
 
05:31:04.868 --> 05:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
call the Fishbowl at the University
 
05:31:06.990 --> 05:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
which is a big open field at that point
 
05:31:08.830 --> 05:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
they had removed themselves from the
 
05:31:11.430 --> 05:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
place concern we have about allowing
 
05:31:12.708 --> 05:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
amplification directly in front of
 
05:31:12.718 --> 05:31:13.628 align:start position:0%
amplification directly in front of
Thompson

05:31:13.628 --> 05:31:13.638 align:start position:0%
Thompson
 
05:31:16.470 --> 05:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
Hall the event the representative
 
05:31:17.788 --> 05:31:17.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned where there was additional
 
05:31:21.150 --> 05:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
police scrutiny that group uh at
 
05:31:22.910 --> 05:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
multiple times had complaints from
 
05:31:25.030 --> 05:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
students of harassment a harassing
 
05:31:27.390 --> 05:31:27.400 align:start position:0%
behavior on behalf of the folks who were
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
on campus handing out their literature
 
05:31:30.788 --> 05:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
up to and including making physical
 
05:31:33.150 --> 05:31:33.160 align:start position:0%
contact with students nevertheless after
 
05:31:34.670 --> 05:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
having a conversation with the police we
 
05:31:37.150 --> 05:31:37.160 align:start position:0%
allow them to come back and continue to
 
05:31:39.548 --> 05:31:39.558 align:start position:0%
exercise the First Amendment rights I
 
05:31:42.868 --> 05:31:42.878 align:start position:0%
think what this document shows is 2011
 
05:31:44.590 --> 05:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
cases over the course of the last year
 
05:31:45.990 --> 05:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
where organizations have wanted to
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
organize and we're given the permission
 
05:31:50.070 --> 05:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
to wanted to assemble hand out
 
05:31:51.310 --> 05:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
information on campus and we're given
 
05:31:53.390 --> 05:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
