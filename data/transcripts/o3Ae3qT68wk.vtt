00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
or at least a paper copy of
 
00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
um of a a draft Amendment to the bill
 
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
that I sent out if anybody does and I've
 
00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 align:start position:0%
got some
 
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
extra what's that it's said what's that
 
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
it says 51 at the top 4 51 at the top to
 
00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
differ it says the amended committee I
 
00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 align:start position:0%
mean amended uh bill yeah yeah not just
 
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
so kind of as a a a recap I know there
 
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
were well there's a wide range of uh
 
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
concerns but I think some of the ones
 
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
that uh I know I heard from the
 
00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
committee were related to
 
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
um you know if the op optometer are
 
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
going to be permitted to do additional
 
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
things the question is do they have
 
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
adequate training especially given as I
 
00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
understand it that um the schools they
 
00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
attended may not have been able to
 
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
either didn't provide the training or
 
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
didn't provide what might be viewed as
 
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
adequate training if for no other reason
 
00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 align:start position:0%
than they uh were in states that did not
 
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
permit uh performing some of these uh
 
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
procedures on actual humans and so they
 
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
would not have had any live practice so
 
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
that was a concern and and
 
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 align:start position:0%
um there were also uh some views
 
00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 align:start position:0%
that um some parts of the bill you know
 
00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
the existing Bill had a lot of detail in
 
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
them especially around uh
 
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
glaucoma um and maybe that should be in
 
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.510 align:start position:0%
glaucoma um and maybe that should be in
rule

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
making um but what I'd like to do is go
 
00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
through the changes in the draft and you
 
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
know see what people have in the way of
 
00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
comments or questions or any of that
 
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
question the chair certainly have we
 
00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
provided copies of this to the uh guests
 
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh I haven't um actually somebody put
 
00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
them up maybe on the table there people
 
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
them yep I think
 
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
yes I just have a comment on the
 
00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
training piece yeah before we get into
 
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
dig into the meet sure I thought a lot
 
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
about this and it's it's sort of the
 
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
chicken in the egg story of no school's
 
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
going to engage in the training if the
 
00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity isn't there to practice it
 
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
because they won't they're not likely to
 
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
Garner right
 
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.430 align:start position:0%
Garner right
students

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and so if the board doesn't approve
 
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
it you know sort of the chicken in the
 
00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
egg thing I think I think there is an
 
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
answer to that and and we'll get to it
 
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
good I'm anxious to hear it is it is an
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
issue yeah um
 
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
but as more states are permitting this
 
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
at least some of these then um I would
 
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
expect that would
 
00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
change and if that causes a slow start
 
00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
to optometrist being able to do that
 
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
here then that's what it is but that's
 
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
what'll happen so um anyway the first
 
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
change is on
 
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh bottom of page four mostly on page
 
00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
and on this thing it's not red but I
 
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
made it bold and and a larger font so
 
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's visible and all this does
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
is there's um this is the section
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
on it's actually the last word on page
 
00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
bottom very yeah
 
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and and it's uh related to an
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
optometrist licens to practice optomet
 
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
prior to uh
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
93 and some uh training they would have
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
to uh do and
 
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's that first sentence and last are
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
left in there one is that they have to
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
take the training and the last is the
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
board shall adopt rules under RSA
 
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
541a to carry out uh the provisions and
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
ensure safety of the public but it's
 
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
taking some of the uh
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
details out in the center section there
 
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.810 align:start position:0%
details out in the center section there
um

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.710 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 align:start position:0%
repres M py and uh thank you Mr chair um
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
I I do appreciate the fact that we are
 
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.189 align:start position:0%
I I do appreciate the fact that we are
giving

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
giving
 
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
provision or the word grandfa in so if
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
somebody graduated from school
 
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
January 1993 and these laser these
 
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
techniques were not even in this this
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't address that at all I mean this
 
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
is uh language that was in the bill
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
around the treatment of glaucoma that
 
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
they're permitted to do now when that
 
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
was my understanding is when that was
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
added there was an issue that there were
 
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists or optometrist sorry who
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
had not had the training for that and
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
this um would require them required them
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
to get that
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
training uh before they could do that
 
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
and um it's been left in I you know I
 
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
don't know that there there's anybody
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
else is going to get licensed newly who
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh had their uh their training or their
 
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
initial license uh you know prior to
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
93 but uh in case there is that's left
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
in here but the details on I this gives
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
Ru making authority to the board to come
 
00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
up with the details of that
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
training um
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
and generally when we do that we we
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
limit the amount of that detail that's
 
00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.110 align:start position:0%
limit the amount of that detail that's
in

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
statute that's what I was going to point
 
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
to is that the rule making is still left
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
to the Optometry board which has
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
functioned as a board uh to govern their
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
profession so that Ru making Authority
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
still at that so that they have the
 
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
ability to govern it that way make the
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
rule and not the legislators to say what
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
profession can do what professional
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
procedure correct although the
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
legislature will review whatever the
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
rules are through the ja car process but
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
the part of 5418 and uh representative
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
Simon you had a question or no
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay gr thank you so I just want to make
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
sure that we just um check this with as
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
was this also recommended by oplc that
 
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
we take this out
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
um is who's here from oplc
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
anyone all
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
right oh uh yeah he may be actually it's
 
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
um um Doug osterhout is supposed to be
 
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
here we can we can I can ask I'll just I
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
have the amendment suggested by
 
00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
oplc that's included in here and we'll
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
get to that correct yeah so I don't
 
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
think it has anything to do no it's it's
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
a different
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
section okay uh but yeah when he comes
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
you want to ask that that's fine
 
00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
um yep
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
sure uh thank you Mr chair repres Brown
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
so yes thank you um so what you are
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
deleting is what is currently in the law
 
00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:48.909 align:start position:0%
deleting is what is currently in the law
correct

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
and just to make that the decision of
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
the board and not to have it in law
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's the point right right and
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
to have it go through Ru making which is
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's public comment and
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
all that that's in and the legislature
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
reviews it which is part of R making
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay and that's because it was thought
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
to be too too much in the weeds for the
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
law right and it may have there may have
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
been reasons um when this was new to do
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
that but that was 93's been a while and
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
there probably aren't representative
 
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:21.879 align:start position:0%
groda than you so last year when we went
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
through all these changes in oplc one of
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
the things that we did do was remove a
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
lot of these
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
dangling rules in statute and put them
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
in Ru making so that way if the rules
 
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
needed to change they could be they
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
could change and that so that I would
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
imagine that's also in line with
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
that right it's uh it can be updated as
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
things change more easily than having to
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
go through this process representative
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
manuti thank you so that clarified in
 
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
terms of giving the rule making to the
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
professional board and process for
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
license ing to oplc so that delineated
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
and increased the transparency of the
 
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
process correct thank you okay again uh
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
represent Brown thank you so for me to
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
be clear if as what it used to say what
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
it says in the law now is if you're
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
prior to January 1st
 
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
93 um you had to have a post-graduate
 
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
course of study but after
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't in the law so am I
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
assuming that a postgraduate course of
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
study after 93 was the norm I want to
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
make sure we aren't deleting something
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
that yes Chang we're getting head nods
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
over there and that was my understanding
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
that that date was there because the
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
schools of Optometry added it okay thank
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
you after that
 
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
point um I'm going to go through this to
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
address the the changes in this draft if
 
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
there are questions about other things
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
in here uh just you know let us know all
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative um Schmid thank you Mr
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
chairman so uh I I hope this this
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
process we're engaged in this morning is
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
going to be an interactive one with the
 
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
uh experts in Optometry and Opthalmology
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
that we have with us this morning so
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
that so that uh we don't talk over their
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
heads or disregard so I I hope that they
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be allowed to interact with
 
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
us as we do this because we know what
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
the ru making process is uh those of us
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
who were on the joint legislative
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules that
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
we call Jael car um Mr demur Mr Curtis
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
wherever you are over there uh so uh um
 
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
the thing is we know what they're what
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but to the degree
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
they they don't understand I I don't
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
want to talk over the top of their head
 
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
sure and and if uh members of the
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee I should say have
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
uh questions you know that certainly
 
00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:01.710 align:start position:0%
uh questions you know that certainly
they

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
can but the rule the ru making process
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
is which I think a fair number of people
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
are familiar with but if you're not um
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know the board would propose D would
 
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
draft proposed rules um they have to go
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
out for public comment there's a period
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
of public comment they have to take
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
those into account and there's also a
 
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.710 align:start position:0%
those into account and there's also a
public

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
hearing and um and once they settle on
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
the rules from that then there's a uh
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
Joint Committee of the house and the
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
Senate that reviews those rules and can
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
ask for changes and then there's a whole
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
whole process there
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
um and actually while we're still on
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
this section and Mr asout arrived uh
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
there was a question so if you could
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
come up
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself and then
 
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself and then
representative

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
and that's a um the draft that I put
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
together you know well with Consulting
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of people and we're going
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
through the changes in that draft and
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
then if people have other questions and
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
we're that's so representative broen
 
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr Oster how on page at the
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
bottom of page
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
four uh it's uh section8 on
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
Optometry uh paragraph
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
two the very last word
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
every continues to the next page and it
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
talks about optometrist that are
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
licensed before January 1st 19
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
1993 and those requirements for that and
 
00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
we are striking that out and making sure
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
that that is part of the rules for under
 
00:12:55.079 --> 00:12:56.670 align:start position:0%
that that is part of the rules for under
RSA

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
541 so is that you could is that
 
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
something that you would not object to
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
from an office
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint good morning Douglas S howc I
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
realized they never actually introduced
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
myself uh the office wouldn't take a
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
position on that we wouldn't have a
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
problem with that okay thank you
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay um represent Moody thank you Mr
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
chair um another question in terms of um
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
the same section um the ru making and
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
the licensing are two processes that
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
oplc is in charge of one and the other
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
one is for rulle making for the board is
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
that um this is clear with the language
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
language would oplc see that as a I
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
think it's clear I'm just looking at it
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
now I I think it's clear I especially in
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
Reading context of the rest of the
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
Practice Act and RSA 310 I I don't think
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
there'd be any confusion from our
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
perspective okay thank you okay um I'd
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
like to go on to um the next change in
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
this draft I'd like to go through the
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
change to this draft and then if there's
 
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.790 align:start position:0%
change to this draft and then if there's
other

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
questions um I'd like to address them
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
then if possible so now at page seven
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
near the top of page
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
s um this is uh really the uh the most
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
substantive change and you know as I
 
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned before there were concerns
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
about you know optometrist not have had
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
not having um adequate training due to
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
the circumstances to perform some of
 
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.350 align:start position:0%
the circumstances to perform some of
these

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.110 align:start position:0%
these
procedures

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and so and this section is um
 
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
examinations and licenses authorization
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
perform alamic
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
procedures and you know it says unless
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise specified this chapter the
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
board will have the authority to
 
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
determine what constitutes the practice
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
Optometry um and that by person's
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
lessons that chapter and that was in the
 
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
original bill but it goes consistent
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
with curriculum of nationally accredited
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
schools and colleges of
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
Optometry and the board of Optometry
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's an editing thing there but and
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
the board of Optometry shall adopt rules
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
under RSA 541a establishing
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
credentialing certific certification
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
which shall fulfill before a person sh
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
be fulfilled before person may be
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
certified to perform opic procedures for
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
the practice Optometry and then it lists
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
a number of things that have to be done
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
as part of that rule
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
making and the first is identification
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
categorization of optomic procedures for
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
the practice of Optometry I mean the
 
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.230 align:start position:0%
the practice of Optometry I mean the
thing

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
is you know there's there are likely to
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
be optometrists that aren't interested
 
00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
in doing all of the new procedures they
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
maybe they wouldn't do any of them maybe
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
they do some and requiring all
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
optometrists to have the training and
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
everything if they're not going to do it
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think makes sense and so this is
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
to have Cate have them create categories
 
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
of them um you know establish an
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
application process for certification to
 
00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:18.110 align:start position:0%
application process for certification to
perform

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
perform
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
them um and and one that met some key
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
concerns is establishment of minimum
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
education training and live experience
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for C certification to
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
perform such procedures and that would
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
be done through Ru Mak which you know
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
everybody has every anybody uh has input
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
and can comment on um it didn't seem to
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
make sense to put specific numbers or
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
hours or whatever in here I don't think
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have the expertise for that exactly
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
but it does require that they have
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
training for the particular classes of
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
procedures they're going to do including
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh live training
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
represent M py thank you Mr chair I
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
think your Chain of Thought is very much
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
in align to our discussions we had
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
earlier with
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
the public hearing so I have questions
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
to two folks one is uh
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology represent representative
 
00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:20.510 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology represent representative
and

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
optometrist it's the same question are
 
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.669 align:start position:0%
optometrist it's the same question are
all

00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist performing all of the
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
proc procedures or their
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
specialization under Opthalmology
 
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
license similarly optometrist not all
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
optometrist are performing every single
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
procedure is their specialization
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
available if I am an optometrist and I
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
want to just do the latest you know I
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
was trained to do just the laser
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
procedure then it's upon me to get
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
certification similarly with the
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology I know with the medical
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
field you have the specialization track
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
where you can do an additional
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
fellowship and you know and so you can
 
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
super specialize but this will help so
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
is that inexistent right now so I think
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh Dr ricardi if if you could answer
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
that and I'm sure we'll get back to you
 
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you my name is Kim
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
lardi I'm an opthalmologist practicing
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and I'm the current
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Society
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
of I Physicians insurgents um to answer
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
your question representative um all
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists as we complete our
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
Residency program we do perform
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
basically all of we experience every
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
procedure as residents and we are
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
required to perform them as an assistant
 
00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:00.039 align:start position:0%
as an observer and as a primary Serv
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
um technically we can do all of the
 
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
procedures when we graduate residency um
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
the majority of us may choose to do a
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
fellowship um to further subsp
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
specialize and with how specific and
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
detailed medicine in general and the eye
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
have become um for example I learned
 
00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
retinal procedures as a resident most
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
Retina Specialists do an additional
 
00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:29.799 align:start position:0%
2-year Fellowship so so I generally do
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
not perform any retinal procedures I
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
refer those to my colleagues who have
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
done a retina Fellowship um and we have
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
several different one to twoe
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
fellowships uh that uh many people
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
pursue okay thank you and um follow up
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
to that is the is that just the practice
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
of opthalmologists uh if they're going
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
to specialize in some area they're going
 
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
to do a fellowship and get further
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
training or is that required either
 
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
statute or rules um it's not required
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
okay but you would have difficulty say
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
obtaining hospital privileges to perform
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
certain surgeries had you not completed
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
a fellowship and demonstrated you know a
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
a case log with experience okay thank
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
you and oh you have a followup sorry um
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
so hospital privileges in in patient
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
surgery or Hospital surgery is one
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
and many of these procedures now the
 
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
advancement of technology has um
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
provided opportunity for the
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist to do outpatient in your
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
office kind of thing does that
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
require um
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
board uh certification or
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
authorization so once once you move a
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
procedure into your office um the
 
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.630 align:start position:0%
procedure into your office um the
oversight

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
is um the oversight of say a hospital
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
credentialing committee is gone um a lot
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
of us operate at outpatient surgery
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
centers um which are not Hospital
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
Affiliated however they do have similar
 
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.789 align:start position:0%
Affiliated however they do have similar
credentialing

00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
processes who who does the credentialing
 
00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:20.919 align:start position:0%
then the board of
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology of the board of
 
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology who credentials the
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
outpatient currently oh I I other than
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
we are board certified we're licensed in
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
the state um the oversight is the Board
 
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.870 align:start position:0%
the state um the oversight is the Board
of

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
Medicine um U just yeah
 
00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the the question that we
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
would need clarification on is we
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
understand the hospital you you ain't
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do that if there
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
unless you've been sufficiently trained
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
and credential and so forth these out
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
these centers that you were referring to
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
is who credentials
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
them and but more specifically in my
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
case is you reference the fact that some
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh practitioners may be doing this in
 
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.470 align:start position:0%
uh practitioners may be doing this in
their

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
their
office

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
um and and uh if we're going to permit
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
optometrist to do this then we have to
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
have some kind of oversight that we know
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
that the person has had the necessary
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
training and that they have the
 
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
necessary Neary skill and experience so
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
that it can be done safely on the
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
patients of New Hampshire that's my
 
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
concern and I'm sure it is of my
 
00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
colleagues as well I agree who is
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
checking the the the the procedure if
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
it's done in the office of the
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist and it would have to be
 
00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
similarly overseen credentialed and safe
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
in the case of an optometrist doing the
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
procedure theoretically right yep I mean
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
if we if we go there yes and that is one
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
of our issues with the bill is there so
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
can you speak to how how it's how it's
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
checked on uh if if an opthalmologist is
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
doing it at his or her office who is uh
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
who is controlling for quality and
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
safety in in those instances for
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology then we're going to have to
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
know that the optometrist is going to be
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
similarly capable I don't think some of
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
these are clearly surgical things that I
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
don't think very many optomet going to
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
want to get to that level of of of thing
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking about a limited
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
expansion of Optometry not the full
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
boore full
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
board uh right so yeah I need to have
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
more more Buy in from you guys with
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
regard to how this is going to be how
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's done as a moment for
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists and how it's going to be
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
done for optomet well just a moment can
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
I jump in here yeah they not they're not
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
going to answer optometrist questions
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
we're asking you how do optimists who
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
cred who is the one that gives the the
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
optomologist credentials for practicing
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
in their office or practicing outside in
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
an outpatient clinic that's the qu from
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
your field how do you do it so um we
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
have all completed a uh Residency
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
program in Opthalmology with minimum
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
training require requirements that
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
program has been certified by the acgme
 
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
which is the American College of
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
graduate medical
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
education um this provides reassurance
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
that we meet a minimum competency um
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that we're competent on
 
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.909 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that we're competent on
live

00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:50.919 align:start position:0%
live
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
patients um and then once we have
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
completed that the Board of Medicine as
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
they're issuing our license is reassured
 
00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
that we have de demonstrated a
 
00:25:04.399 --> 00:25:05.990 align:start position:0%
that we have de demonstrated a
minimal

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
competency in the procedures within our
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
field follow up follow up so the Board
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
of Medicine license licenses you get
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
from the Board of Medicine allows you to
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
practice in your office and on an
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
outpatient basis yes out patient clinics
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
is that right correct and then in
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
addition to that if you if you want to
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
practice in a hospital you have to meet
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
their criteria and they okay and that's
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
where hospital privileg it's an
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
additional credential
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
process that answers our question thank
 
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you thank
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
you oh wait hang on another question
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
represent Brown sorry thank you sorry I
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
always need clarification
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
apparently um so that would be the case
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
probably for any
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
certification across any any industry
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
you're certified to this by the license
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
ing agency you can do it wherever you
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
want unless somewhere you go has
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
stricter requirements yes does that make
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
sense that's what we're all saying right
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank one more
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
represent G and just just another brief
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
clarification so what you're saying is
 
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of Specialties specializing
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
um in any of those areas you've been
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
minimally trained in there is no
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
credentialing that happens Beyond um the
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
normal licensing for your
 
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
occupation that applies to the
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
credentialing if you're working in your
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
office or in one of these centers that
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
outside the hospital realm is that
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
correct did I understand that right
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
correct there there's certain procedures
 
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
that you might be required to carry
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
additional malpractice insurance
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
for uh so anyone
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
else okay thank
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
you okay um i' like the same question
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
for the optom if they can answer we're
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
working on it here um I I probably uh Dr
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
Sawyer uh would be
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
best and
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh have to be yeah yeah actually yeah
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
you almost have to eat it got it thank
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
you um if you could go over uh this
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
section the changes to this section um
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
there's a copy uh I I'm I believe I'm
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
from I've got that one okay yes I
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
believe I have it here in front of me
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
okay so again my name is Dr Angelique
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
soyer I am an optometrist and practice
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
owner in North Conway and Berlin New
 
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I am a past president of
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire um Association of
 
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
Optometry um so in answer to your
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
question first um
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
all optometrists coming out of school at
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
this time have the training and the
 
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
education what they may not all have
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
coming out of school is that live
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
patient experience this amendment is
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
specifi specifically requiring that
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
there will be a live um requirement
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
necessary some of the students coming
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
out of school will have the training but
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
if they do not plan to go on to do these
 
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
procedures they might not seek out
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
getting that live patient experience if
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
they're in a state that has the
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
authority to do that they will likely
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
have that experience as part of their
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
education and as more states have that
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
it will become inherent that more are
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
graduating with it whether they're
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
seeking it out or not um while we're
 
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:46.519 align:start position:0%
still in a a period where um there are a
 
00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:48.039 align:start position:0%
number of schools that are in states
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
where that is not something they can get
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
at their school on a regular basis um it
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
is incumbent on them to seek that out
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
during the fourth year of the um
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
Optometry training program is entirely
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
in clinical practice and students have
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to choose where they do
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
that clinical practice so if somebody is
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
planning to go to a state or they're
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
wanting to in their future perform these
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
procedures they can seek out rotations
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
in the states where they will be able to
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
get that live
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
experience within the four years of
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
optometry school which includes that
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
year of clinical rotations um we have
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
learned the basics what may be missing
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
is that l
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
um experience the additional residency
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
is a for Optometry is akin to the
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
fellowship for an opthalmologist if they
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
want to then go on and specialized and
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
just do retina they may do an additional
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
Fellowship in Optometry because we know
 
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
from day one that we are specializing in
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
the eye all four years of our training
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
are focused on the eye and how we are
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
going to be treating all of these
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
conditions how these systemic condition
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
relate to the eye in Opthalmology and
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
Medicine your four years of medical
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
school you don't know that you're going
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
to be an opthalmologist so only when you
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
begin your residency are you then now
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
becoming an opthalmologist and beginning
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
your more specialized training in that
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
residency process so their residency is
 
00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:19.350 align:start position:0%
residency process so their residency is
very

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
different to what an Optometric
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
residency is our Optometric residency is
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
more akin to their Fellowship where we
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
have all that basic training within the
 
00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:30.039 align:start position:0%
Optometric education and you could then
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
go on to specialize if you wanted to be
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
a pediatric opthalmologist if you wanted
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
to do specialty contact lenses um if you
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to do vision therapy for people
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
who have low vision um those are the
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
more specialized Optometric residencies
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
so um that um I hope answers your
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
question there as far as the type of
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
training and where some will come out of
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
school having this training may not have
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
the live experience and may not pursue
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
that if that's not something that
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
they're planning to do in their practice
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
and one thing I'd like to add I back is
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I hadn't covered is uh section two on
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
page seven starting line
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
23 it's no optometrist shall practice
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
under this section unless the
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
optometrist has submitted to the board
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
of Optometry evidence of satisfactory
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
completion of all requirements for
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
specific procedures and the board has
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
certified the Optometry is qualified so
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
if they haven't
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
completed the uh uh training
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
requirements in the uh categories of
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
optim op AIC procedures they want to do
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
um then they're not permitted to do
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
them uh represent MRA py thank you Mr
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
chair so is there a minimum hours
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
required by the Optometry specialization
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
fellowship or whatever you call that
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
residency or for specialty especially in
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
operative the newer Technologies that's
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
available laser or um if I can just add
 
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
something and then um so setting that is
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
is given to them with rulemaking however
 
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
would I answer the question but also
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
address there's I know there's a um
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
accrediting Association for the schools
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
and um which the chapter mentions and um
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
so do they have such requirements yes so
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
the schools um are all accredited by the
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
um the ACO that is our accrediting body
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
for all these schools and and colleges
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
of Optometry um at this point and this
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
is why we didn't have concrete answers
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to give last week is that
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
accrediting body does not have a minimum
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
number of procedures Nationwide because
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
there are so many schools that are not
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
able to do this so that is why in this
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
amendment and through rul making there
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
is a live requirement and and it there
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
is a um a minimum number of procedures
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
that will need to be done for somebody
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
to come to New Hampshire with time that
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
that will become the norm across the
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
country in all of the schools as they
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
have the ability to get to meet those
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
minimums um but at this time because
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
there is um there is not that ability
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
there is not the live experience minimum
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
by the acoe um on average the Optometry
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
schools um we spend about 2500 hours in
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
classroom and lab training and about
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
2500 hours in clinic
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
follow up follow thank you uh Mr chair
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for indulging in the time um
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
so from my recollection there are 24
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
schools of Optometry in this country and
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
the two closest to our state we don't
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
have any in our state correct are they
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
doing these trainings are you know if
 
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
you're able to draw from the neighboring
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
states close to us are they doing these
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
trainings are these available for the
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
optometrist the two schools in
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts are not able to perform
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
live experiences on patients because
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does not have the ability
 
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
however students from those schools can
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
do their clinical rotations in states
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
that have that ability to get that live
 
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
experience follow up which are those
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
States close by or the the closest at
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
Indiana and and I think that goes to uh
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
some of them maybe represent Gould if I
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
may be remembering correctly about the
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
chicken egg thing I mean this may grow
 
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
slowly because of those kind of
 
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
limitations but at least it allows that
 
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.669 align:start position:0%
limitations but at least it allows that
to

00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
proceed uh representative
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
groa so if
 
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
a let's assume that the board of
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
Optometry is set up okay and it's doing
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
the ru making as it should so
 
00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
then with they be then the accrediting
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
body for optometrist in New
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the optometrists in
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
graduating would still need to um
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
graduate from an accredited school y um
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
they still pass their licensing exams
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
particularly if somebody were to then go
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
on and want to do these
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
procedures then they need to meet the
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements that have been laid
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
out by the board and the board is aware
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
of this amendment they're aware of what
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
is being what will be required to be
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
done in rulemaking um there are some
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
draft languages that are already being
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
put together as to what that's going to
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
look like um to to make sure that that
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
is robust and and that they're prepared
 
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
to do that safely and yes slowly this is
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
going to take a long time for it to go
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking it's going to take a
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
long time um for people to get these
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
experiences I don't Envision any
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
optometrist in the state is going to be
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
doing this for at least a year before
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
anybody's actually able able to be doing
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
any of these things in practice um the
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
board is um you know adamant that they
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
correctly I think I'm I had a followup
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
but I I lost it so I'll come back to it
 
00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:14.710 align:start position:0%
but I I lost it so I'll come back to it
represent

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you Mr chair so this
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
might be a a question for you or
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
attorney arer how or or anyone that
 
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
wants to answer it I suppose if I'm
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's saying that optometrists will make
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
decisions for their practice about op
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
opthamologist procedures would that be
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
similar to would that be similar to an
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
electrician making a decision for a
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
plumber no no Opthalmic procedures means
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
relating to the eye it is not
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
specifically an opthalmologist procedure
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
or an Optometric procedure so that term
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
in um that line where you say to perform
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
Opthalmic procedure
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
simply means relating to the
 
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.750 align:start position:0%
simply means relating to the
eye

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
eye
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay nothing in this statue or anywhere
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
within the bill impacts how Opthalmology
 
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
practices they're entirely within the
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine okay and follow up or
 
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
another question um yeah first I'm going
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
to point out that um if you look
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
at um under Section six
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
um it starts on page two but a lot of
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
it's on The Following on page three and
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
then four it it actually um provides
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
some limitations
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
on what the optometrist can do and
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's quite a few things that they're
 
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
not permitted to do and since that's in
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
statute uh the rul making by the board
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
of Optometry could not permit them to do
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
it yeah and I have more questions on
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
that after through the Section okay um
 
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.150 align:start position:0%
that after through the Section okay um
so

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I know I do have a follow up follow
 
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:08.839 align:start position:0%
y as these are then Opthalmic and not
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
opthalmologic procedures the
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
requirements for live experience don't
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
have to match those obviously so that
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
would be the board will be setting live
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
experience requirements for non optim
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
opic procedures is that correct yes for
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
for the optometrist to perform these
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
procedures would be set by the board
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
however their intention at this point is
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
to have it match the minimums of what is
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
required by opthalmologists coming out
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
of residency the
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
acgme um which is five five five laser
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
five of each of the lasers and and 55
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
and four are the uh the number of
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
procedures for the lasers that are
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
required minimums for Opthalmology
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
coming out of residency and so the board
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
of Optometry plans to mirror that in Ru
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
making thank you okay representative
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
gold thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question it's pretty
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
simple one um regarding the terminology
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
live experience requirements I just
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to you use that term so I'm
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that is a common term in your
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
field yes okay yes and then the um next
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
line down on line 19 on page 7 uh
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
protocols for proctoring yes can you
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
just explain to me what proctoring is so
 
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
that would be for those who have been
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
out of practice to get that live
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
experience um and so that would be
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
performing procedures under somebody who
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
is trained in performing those
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
procedures already be it an optometrist
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
an opthalmologist be it um in New
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at a school in a state that
 
00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
those procedures are already being
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
performed thank you thank you uh rep
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
represent gr did you have a question
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chair I just have a
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
question so do optometrist only practice
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
office no optometrists can practice
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um some optometrists do um
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
have hospital privileges and and take
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
emergency call for hospitals um it's
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
rare the majority do not the majority of
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
care is provided in the office I don't
 
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
know of any that have any privileges at
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgical centers because we
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
aren't doing surgical procedures even
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
the things that we're looking for here
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
um while there's nothing that would
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
prevent them from being able to do it in
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
a surgical center if that's where the
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
laser was located and that's where they
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to have it done and they wanted
 
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
to pursue that pathway of of
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
credentialing um what we're aiming for
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
Here We largely envisions optometrists
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
doing in their office these are in
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
office procedures okay thank you thank
 
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
you and U representative mipi did you
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you uh Mr chair
 
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
just basic confusion that keeps coming
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
up optom Board of Optometry exists and
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a new board that's going to be
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
formed it exists independently of the
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
medical board which is Opthalmology is
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
part of yes exactly the board of
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
Optometry has been around for over a
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
hundred years it is independent it has
 
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
never been under the Board of Medicine
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
um the only thing changing from here is
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
one there is a name change um it has
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
been referred to as the board of
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
registration on an optometry rather than
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
just the board of Optometry so s SP 440
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
does to name it analogous to all the
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
other professional boards and what we're
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
talking about here is that Ru making
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
Authority and moving more into their
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
ability to control through ruem rather
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
than having it spelled out specifically
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
in statute follow up Mr check how often
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
does the board of Optometry meet I
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's every six weeks every every
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
six week which I haven't
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
seen I don't know if I have time I will
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
at some point yep um what I'd like to do
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
is the the next section it's Rel very
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
much related to this if you look at the
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
very bottom of page seven and it goes on
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
to page
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
eight um it's an
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
addition that says uh and this is in the
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
um disciplinary action section of the
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
statute it adds uh that performing
 
00:42:27.309 --> 00:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
authorized Opthalmic procedures without
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
certification based upon the
 
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
requirements outlined in 327 colon 6D
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
which is the part we just went through
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
shall be grounds for suspension or
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
revocation of an optometry license Andor
 
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
certification to perform authorized
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
optomic procedures so just to make it
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
clear that that uh they're not to
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
perform procedures that they haven't
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
been you know certified by the
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
requirements of the board and that if
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
they do they can be disciplined for it
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
uh let's see anybody in the verb much py
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so many questions popping up
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of optometrist um you
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
also have to carry a liability
 
00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:20.839 align:start position:0%
malpractice liability all those
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
insurances yes does that change with the
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
specialization if if you are doing
 
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
Advanced procedures there is additional
 
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
coverage that you need to carry your
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
your malpractice or liability provider
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
needs to be aware they specifically ask
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
you when you're renewing your policy are
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
you in a state where this is permitted
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
are you performing these procedures
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
find so when you and the optometrist and
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist work together hand in
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
hand are there any time when the
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
optometrist is doing the advanced
 
00:43:59.470 --> 00:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
procedure that liability is transferred
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
to the opthalmologist if you're on the
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
team no no
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay um so um are there any other
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
questions at this point for
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
um for Dr Sawyer Sawyer thank
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
you well Mr chairman we we're seeing
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
audience excuse me excuse me I I'm
 
00:44:27.549 --> 00:44:27.559 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate fully here I
 
00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:29.079 align:start position:0%
don't have a vote but I'm allowed to
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
participate fully when I see Hands being
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
raised or heads shaking out there I want
 
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:37.559 align:start position:0%
to find out what they are referencing
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
not we we are we have our role to play
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
here but they have their role and when I
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
see hands and they're not responded to
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not satisfied with that procedure
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me but when they're raising their
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
hands I want to he have them be
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
recognized so we can address the issues
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
raising thank you all right
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
um we'll get to that in a moment do you
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
have you have another
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
question I do have a question
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
that uh I need for clarification for
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
myself before we get off of this section
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
so during the hearing if I recall I
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
heard that there's 220 and correct me
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
any one if I'm approximately
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
220 codes for up up up mologic
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
procedures the
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
optometrist asked if they could do that
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
they would like to do 44 of
 
00:45:37.839 --> 00:45:39.750 align:start position:0%
they would like to do 44 of
those

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
so in this amendment do you see that you
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
procedures the way that the amendment is
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
it could be up to those 44 the board in
 
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.670 align:start position:0%
it could be up to those 44 the board in
rule

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
making has the opportunity and at this
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
point the intention to further narrow
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
that down um they uh as part one
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
indicates the identification and
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
categorization of procedures they would
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
spell out what those procedures are um I
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
do not believe their intention is to CL
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
include all 44 of those procedures
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
within the rule making and followup sir
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you for entertaining me
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
here um and those 44 you would say are
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
Opthalmic procedures yes okay if anyone
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
disagrees with that or if I can clarify
 
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:37.559 align:start position:0%
anymore don't take that personally not a
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
problem let let the brain know here I'd
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate that okay thank you okay um
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
before we move on to anything else
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any further questions
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
at this point for um Dr
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
Sawyer okay thank you thank you very
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
much and
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
um if I mean there were were some
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
questions from that side of the room if
 
00:47:08.589 --> 00:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
comment you need to turn the mic on and
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
I do I apologize thank you um I'm not
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
that loud so uh thank you I will try to
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
be quick didn't get a chance to look at
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment beforehand can introduce
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
yourself first please I'm Katherine
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
mirando I'm an opthalmologist here in
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
town at conquered ey Center um and I'm a
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
glaucoma a specialist I did my training
 
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
at masser I'm two years out of practice
 
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
so hopefully I can well remember
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
training and speak maybe uh to those
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of um of what's being addressed
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
in this bill so I think one thing that's
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
important is that and that's quite novel
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
is that there's no model in any other
 
00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:53.559 align:start position:0%
state for minimums or criteria in the
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
training two of the 24 states that allow
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
allow um of residencies that allow
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hands-On training what we heard at the
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
hearing was that there is no um minimum
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
right now for the the number of patients
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
and the way in Opthalmology we determine
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
competency is more than just minimums
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
because you could have a minimum number
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
of procedures and still not be competent
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
with them the acgme actively works with
 
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
these programs and residencies to sure
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
that the residents are meeting criteria
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
have active meetings make sure that the
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
um professors training are qualified
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
themselves and actively evaluating
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
before they would um graduate someone we
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
don't have an optimetric School in New
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so it's not that this bill
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
would allow that training to begin here
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
and we have we have it's very know like
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
we have no other state to even look to
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
for how this is being done currently
 
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
I've tried I know I'm not an optometrist
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to learn as quickly as I can
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
about the um depth and breadth of their
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
training but I don't pre presume to know
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
exactly what they go through but I I can
 
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
say that I don't see another state to
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
even look to to understand how we would
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
implement this here and I also think
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
that in terms of patient safety which is
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
the reason that I canceled my clinic
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
this morning um I don't understand the
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes reporting and and way to
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
measure measure safety because we know
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
we brought someone to the hearing who
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
was blinded by one of these lasers yet
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
there were zero reported outcomes so I
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
think we don't even have a a good system
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
in another state to look to where they
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
are having minimum criteria where they
 
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
are reporting safety um and that
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
minimums alone are not enough to
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
determine competency at least in the way
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
we do it in um in the medical uh side of
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
things and then we also had a letter for
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
speaking to to the um insurance coverage
 
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
OMC the major supplier or major um
 
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
provider of malpractice insurance um had
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
a letter that they did not support
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
extending these uh surgical surgical
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
coverage to
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
optometrist um most opthalmologists are
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
even uh covered under OMC so I don't
 
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
know how if if there would try to be
 
00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:23.559 align:start position:0%
some type of um merger together of
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology and Optometry and training
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
how we would even be able to help um
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
supervise I just I I'm not seeing a
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
pathway forward in this amendment and it
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
was just presented moments ago but I've
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
tried to look as much as I can into the
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
training I just don't see
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
um understand a safe way that we're
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
considering how we're considering
 
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
patient safety with this okay thank you
 
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm gonna um ask um Dr Sawyer to to
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
give her perspective but but um are
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
there yeah are there any questions
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
before that uh represent M py thank you
 
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
question and uh thank you for being here
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I know it's difficult uh but I
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
understand that the schools in Optometry
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
has just started this or 10 years ago or
 
00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
you know in the the two schools that are
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
training in the specialty has only
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
started 10 years years ago 15 years when
 
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
the laser started with the Opthalmology
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
too um so that was my point in terms
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
of the it didn't exist so the
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance for Opthalmology
 
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
the company that does that is not even
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact that this could be
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
something coming up for Optometry so you
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
know the Optometry will they cover or
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
not cover
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
that is a if they're not able to get the
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
malpractice coverage how can they even
 
00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
practice because that is the critical
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
thing right so there is one at least
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
from my point of view that's uh there is
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
a check and balance I believe from the
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
liability don't you agree well there's
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
more than just OMC uh which is the
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
insurance provider that I was mentioning
 
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure there would be um
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
potentially ways around that and then
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
OMC did submit a letter that was
 
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
included in the packet I'm so sorry I
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
don't know off hand um but but OMC did
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
submit a letter with the knowledge of
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
this um this bill being put forward so
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
it is with the newest information that
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
was provided to them um and I think that
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
even if this is a newer concept being
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
put forward to have optometrist trying
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
to do surgeries we should have a
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
framework in place for safety and
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
training before we are out practicing
 
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
and certifying um providers to do
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
surgery on patients which is currently
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
happening but in other states but
 
00:53:08.079 --> 00:53:09.510 align:start position:0%
happening but in other states but
there's

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
no competency criteria to attain that
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
status so it seems like the cart is a
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
far ahead of the
 
00:53:18.079 --> 00:53:20.750 align:start position:0%
far ahead of the
horse

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
horse
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
um actually a representative gr thank
 
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.589 align:start position:0%
um actually a representative gr thank
you

00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure you understand because
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
the cart is not in front of the horse
 
00:53:34.349 --> 00:53:34.359 align:start position:0%
okay there's no cart even there's no
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
horse all we have is what we're saying
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
is that the optometrist will form their
 
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:43.720 align:start position:0%
criteria to proceed to do these
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
procedures they may be different than
 
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
the way you perform them but when you
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
look at all the things that you
 
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
do let's say of what sliver of the pie
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
procedures that they want to do what's
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
sliver of the pie I guess I do about 20
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
every two weeks uh not you per se but
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about of all the things that
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist do yes what percentage
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
are these procedures
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
and what is the percentage of risk in
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
these procedures are we asking them like
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm using this as a hypothetical
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
example if I want to take a splinter out
 
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
of my finger right I'm going to go to my
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
primary care physician and they can take
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
the splinter out they're not going to
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
send me to a
 
00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:45.559 align:start position:0%
surgeon right so if I go to an
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
optometrist or my optometrist and I need
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
one of these procedures
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
done I am
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
I if they are accredited by the they're
 
00:54:59.470 --> 00:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
bored to do so because they have done so
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
many of these procedures and it's not up
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
to we do not look at what other states
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
do we look at what is right for our
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
state that's what we decide we base it
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
on what we want we don't look at what
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
other states do okay and one of the
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
requirements that became very apparent
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
in the hearing is that
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
live um clinical experience was required
 
00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:27.799 align:start position:0%
and we went to the excuse me
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
the acgm and we use those right so you
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
can't say that we have no criteria or
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
that the cart is before the horse
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
because we have set up the criteria you
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
may not agree with it that may be the
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
issue but don't say that we haven't said
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
anything or that we haven't done that
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
because we we are doing that that's this
 
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
process does this make sense to you
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
know I I apologize I'm I'm I think that
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
is new to this amendment which I'm just
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
seeing now is this introduction of these
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
um not just introducing the ideas of
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
minimum so I completely appreciate that
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just I truly am here just for
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
patient safety I don't in any way think
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure there are plenty of
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
optometrists that are much smarter than
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
I am it's really just a pathway of of
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
providing Safe Care and so I'm trying to
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand that and that's
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
what we're discussing today but um and I
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
apologize if I sound first of all I have
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
I have allergies so I don't normally
 
00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:33.390 align:start position:0%
sound like this but also
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:36.270 align:start position:0%
sound like this but also
[Music]

00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
um we have I mean one of the reasons why
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
we are on this committee is that we care
 
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
about Public Safety as well we get Bill
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
after Bill after Bill about
 
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
licensing at the same time we are not we
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
are we are also sympathetic to hurdles
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
that could be put in the the path of
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
others who are competent to do to do it
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
but others are concerned and won't let
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
them so we are we're going to test that
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
hurdle and we're gonna that's our job
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we do at the same time we
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
weigh that and we weigh Public Safety so
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
I just want you to understand that and I
 
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you're here for Public
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
Safety but we're here for that too does
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
that make sense makes perfect sense and
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it and so I'm I think then
 
00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
I am complete agreement that we should
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the competency criteria and
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
how to go about in ensuring that and I
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
just don't um I'm not I'm not sure what
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
the pathway is to that I don't um see a
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
a plan that makes sense yet so I'm glad
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
that we're that's what's um we're trying
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
to understand um I knew had said one oh
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
and then safety I guess that's where I
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
have maybe the most understanding and
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
that was my testimony previously but
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
these are not like we moving a splinter
 
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
irreversible um just a moment one one
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
thing I will um kind of tried to explain
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
it before
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
but in the section where it's talking
 
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:12.039 align:start position:0%
about you know determining what the
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
procedures are um what the process is
 
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
what the education training and live
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
requirements are and all of that um you
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
know what it means when it says that's
 
00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:25.039 align:start position:0%
going to be done through 541a rule
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
making is that it's not that the
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
optometrists on their own are going to
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
cook up whatever they want and go forth
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
and do whatever they want um you know
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
that is open to public comment and
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
review including by um opthalmologists
 
00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
and everybody else in the in the state
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
or country I guess um so part of the
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
process is
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
that I suspect there will be a lot of um
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
scrutiny of whatever proposed rules um
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're they come up with and then
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to be reviewed by um you
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
know the legislature as well and so uh
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
we're not telling them go out and do
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
whatever you want that that's not what
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
this process is um Reverend
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you Mr chair yeah just for
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
clarification purposes because it is
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
very Dynamic situation it's changing
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
constantly so I appreciate the position
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
that you're in with new information
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
coming at you um all of the time but in
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
agreement with you just real briefly
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at in that amendment
 
00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:31.720 align:start position:0%
is the skeleton essentially we set the
 
00:59:33.549 --> 00:59:33.559 align:start position:0%
skeleton and then through Ru making
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
they'll fill in all of the details of of
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
what that pertains to I did ask at the
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
last meeting uh for the optometrist
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
board to give me an a sense an idea of
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
what that rule making process might look
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
like what kind of um requirements that
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're putting in place um I've
 
00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
received that which I was appreciative
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
of um it's right now I mean it's subject
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
to change but it's about three pages
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
long and it does take into consideration
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
the things that you're you're talking
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
about so beyond minimum standards which
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
it does have minimum standards in it it
 
01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:04.839 align:start position:0%
does also have a perceptor ship which
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody will have the ability to
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
talk to um so that somebody with
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
experience is going to be overseeing the
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
training and putting their stamp of
 
01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
approval that they are actually
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
competent in doing the procedure not
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
that they've just done five but they can
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
actually do it well with Public Safety
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
in mind uh and there is also a reporting
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for procedures that are done
 
01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
back to the board so that we can keep an
 
01:00:28.589 --> 01:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
eye on um that sort of thing so once
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
again that's not what we'll handle here
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
in this particular place unfortunately
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
the process will be longer um if this
 
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
bill goes forward because we will be
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
pushing it over to Ru making um and then
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
all of those components will come up and
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
you'll have an opportunity at that point
 
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
to speak any concerns you might have
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
with the very specific rules that are
 
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
coming up in those categories um so just
 
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
so you know it's not make a break it
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
here um so that was all I wanted to say
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank that's all interesting information
 
01:00:59.549 --> 01:00:59.559 align:start position:0%
so I'll get back to you thank you Mr
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so the chair stated
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
earlier toward the beginning one of the
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
things that we always have to keep in
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
mind is we are not opening the entire
 
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.789 align:start position:0%
mind is we are not opening the entire
Museum

01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
Museum
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
here we
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
are considering expanding what
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
optometrist can do in certain specific
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
areas not not the entirety of what
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists do
 
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:29.039 align:start position:0%
but certain specific things and that's
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
all we're talking about and the chair
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
wisely alluded to that earlier on so
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do
 
01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:39.559 align:start position:0%
is what I'm trying to see is to get at
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
the things that the optomet are asking
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
to do to see which of those things you
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
say absolutely not or possibly that this
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
could be a workable area in which
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
optometrist could be sufficiently
 
01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
trained and credentials and so forth um
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
and in which it would improve access in
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
the entirety of New Hampshire and that
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
is as representative grotus said earlier
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
that's our concern what can we do for
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the people in the state
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that would also
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
benefit the optometrist in in expanding
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
their practice but not opening the
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
entire Museum as I said
 
01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
so and and and the chair alluded to that
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
and we have to keep that in mind we're
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
not talking about everything and and
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative Simon said we were
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
creating the he called it a skeleton but
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
the the amendment if we adopt it will
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
permit uh the the rule writers with the
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
involvement of stako stakeholders and
 
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
practitioners to develop the necessary
 
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
rules in that one L limited area or
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
small areas that we are specifically
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
talking about that's all we're not
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
trying to get into the whole ocean here
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
just one little cup of it representative
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
gr thank you um sorry represent M py
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for the eye
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
contact so I knew it was you're refering
 
01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.349 align:start position:0%
contact so I knew it was you're refering
to

01:03:16.349 --> 01:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
me um one more uh in terms of um your
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
concern I understand and we don't want
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
to uh change the you know upset the
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
apple card to say but we can't be status
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
coal either the reason one of the big
 
01:03:40.799 --> 01:03:42.109 align:start position:0%
coal either the reason one of the big
reasons

01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
for uh me as a legislator this is
 
01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
important for is the fact that we have
 
01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage we have access
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
shortage and we don't have medical
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
school got public Medical School dental
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
school Optometry or any of those in our
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
state how do we attract new Workforce as
 
01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
we age as the state ages we need more
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce and how do we attract there
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
might be this special caveat to get
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
attract more you know well
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
trained uh folks to come in rather than
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
putting um
 
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839 align:start position:0%
obstacles so I'm looking at this as do I
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
want to age in this state or do I have
 
01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
to move out to be able to afford
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
anything so that that's a critical thing
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
so that is also another side to it which
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
enables newer coming
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
out uh
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
graduated with not a burden of debt that
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
they can't do anything have to go to a
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
better paying
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
state so those are all the things that
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
come into play um just really quickly uh
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
representative manood I hope you want to
 
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
stay in New Hampshire it's beautiful and
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
um I think everyone here loves it uh in
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
the packet on page 19 we had a diagram
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
of the the number of optometrists um
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
that increased by 40 almost 46% from
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
2013 to 2023 whereas the population
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
increased by um 5.6% so it seems like a
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
lot there are a lot of optometrist
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
coming to the state I don't think we
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
have any access data for the lasers that
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
I think and when we were mentioning the
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
small piece of the P I think you know as
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
active amendments are coming through my
 
01:05:41.549 --> 01:05:41.559 align:start position:0%
inclination or understanding is that
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
what what is wanted are three lasers the
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
yag Pi SLT um uh and uh yag cap and
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
those are
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
elective lasers they're not emergencies
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
and um access to those is they're
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
they're just not emergencies so it's not
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
needing to be seen within a week they
 
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
are I I don't have any data of access
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
issues with those three specific lasers
 
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
that are being addressed in this bill so
 
01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
I'm a little unclear on how this bill
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
solves issues with access it would be
 
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
interesting if there was Data showing
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
um I don't know um i' I'd like if um
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
either Dr soy or Donahue want to comment
 
01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you um a couple of things that
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
I will just respond to um first omic is
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
um their from their website it was
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
started by opthalmologist the credential
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
and they they um I'm sorry not
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
credential but they provide liability
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
coverage for opthalmologists so um from
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
their website our mission is to serve
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
the needs of the members of the American
 
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
Academy of Opthalmology so I'm not
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
surprised that they wouldn't support or
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
um cover an optometrist um but in all of
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
the states that optometrists are
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
performing these they have no problems
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
in securing malpractice
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
insurance um the it was brought up that
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
um there are no states to model after
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
there are states to model after that do
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
require live requirements Kentucky
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
requires live practice um live cases
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
before practicing independently um most
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
recently South Dakota passed this um
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
just this year and they also have a live
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
minimum requirement of patient cases so
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
there are other states um we will look
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
to those States but we will may take it
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
even further beyond that we want to as
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
as I said the board wants to do this
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
safely slowly um effectively and do it
 
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
right the first time and we may become
 
01:07:58.589 --> 01:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
the model that other states then model
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
after to do it right um the uh
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
optometrists yes are still coming to the
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
state part of that is because there are
 
01:08:10.029 --> 01:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
more optometrists that are coming out as
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned in my testimony last
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
week the um rate of opthalmologists is
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
projected to continue declining um I
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
believe somebody had asked um in that
 
01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
hearing and we did um determined that it
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
is projected that optometrists will grow
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
by at least 9% over the next 10 years so
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
there will continue to be optometrists
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
available um our concern is that we want
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
the best of the best to want to come
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
here to be practicing at that high level
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
um and and to be able to to fully
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
utilize the education um that they have
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
um lastly as far as the access issue
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
while these procedures um may not be
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
emergency um they they may be elective
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
um we don't want to wait until our
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
patients are in a state of emergency to
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
have to get these done
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
um we had a case of a patient who you
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
you know suffered terribly um for quite
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
six six weeks um when she had already
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
been in her surgeon's office and was not
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
treated at that day and she had one eye
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
and while it was not an emergency it was
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
an elective procedure so she can wait
 
01:09:15.789 --> 01:09:15.799 align:start position:0%
six weeks and her life was miserable in
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
those six weeks so um we want to be
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
proactive and give patients access um
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
there will still absolutely be cases of
 
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
these same procedur that I could do that
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
I will choose not to do in more complex
 
01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
cases where I'm going to recommend that
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
they travel the distance to somebody who
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be able to handle a higher
 
01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
risk case that is part of our
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
professional ethics and our training and
 
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
what we do is making those judgment
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
calls um I think that covers what I
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond to were there any
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
other questions that you any questions
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay thank you thank you I
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to um hang on a minut we'll get
 
01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.550 align:start position:0%
I'd like to um hang on a minut we'll get
back

01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh Mr osterhout if you can come
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
up and
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
um this is on page eight starting at
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
line seven and the reason I'm asking him
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
to come up and talk about this is this
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
language was from oplc at their
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
request Mr chairman when when we have a
 
01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:19.110 align:start position:0%
request Mr chairman when when we have a
hand

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
raised but but the thing
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
is if we get into something else then
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
she may forget question I mean a brief
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
response I do not want to get an
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
extended debate about all of this so one
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
person a brief response to whatever is
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
causing the hand raising you need to
 
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
causing the hand raising you need to
come

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
up I will keep this very very brief but
 
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
in response to the particular case that
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
was mentioned here of this woman needing
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
to wait 6 weeks after she had already
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
seen the surgeon the primary the reason
 
01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
that that happens is because we have to
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
obtain prior authorization for the
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
procedure and if we truly want to
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
improve access there are other issues at
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
hand that need to be addressed I
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
understand unfortunately that's the
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee and not us I just
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring that to your attention
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
have enough to deal with that that that
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
would solve a lot of problem thank you
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
for that information thank you thank you
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's very important
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
Insurance that's right that's I don't
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
need that
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
no um anyway if you know this was I
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
added this at your request so why don't
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
you explain what this is about I think I
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
know but I'm sorry page eight it starts
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
at line
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
seven so this was just uh reading in the
 
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
bill I think a week ago I just noticed
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
some of the language conflicted with the
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
procedures laid out in RSA 310 and so
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
this proposal very straightforward is
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
just to bring those in line with the PLC
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
statute okay if you can just mention
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
some of them sure General sure um so I'm
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
on line seven or I'm in line nine uh
 
01:12:07.629 --> 01:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
permits are now issued by the office
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
3104 Roman numeral 2 parentheses
 
01:12:13.239 --> 01:12:15.550 align:start position:0%
3104 Roman numeral 2 parentheses
c

01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
c
 
01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.310 align:start position:0%
c
um

01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
again with line 13 the office issues
 
01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.070 align:start position:0%
again with line 13 the office issues
that

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
permit going through um line 22 on to
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
23 it says the business complies with
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
all lawful directions and requirements
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
for information from the Board of
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and the board of
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
Optometry of all states in which it
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
conducts business the only reason I
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
added suggested language or other
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
applicable licensing Authority where
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
here some states it's board some states
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
their advisory it it just it's a
 
01:12:51.629 --> 01:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
catch-all language kind of thing so
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the licensing Authority would
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
be in the other state
 
01:12:59.629 --> 01:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
that was my goal here and I think that
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
was it for my requests okay any
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions represent mipi thank you Mr
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
so uh the 21 to 23 that is in case of a
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
reciprocity coming from another state
 
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.669 align:start position:0%
reciprocity coming from another state
correct

01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
no for somebody if I have had a
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
Optometry license I don't think it's got
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
anything to do with that it's you can
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
address but I think there's an earlier
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
requirement in here related to that okay
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
if you can one one more followup just
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
would I mean I I this is this is not
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
related so the reciprocity stuff would
 
01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
be in RSA 31017 and then the PLC 313 so
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
this is related
 
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.350 align:start position:0%
this is related
to

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
um it it doesn't really change the
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
meaning of the chapter of 32725 let so
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
there there is some restriction here on
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
um optometrists operating
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
businesses um retail businesses selling
 
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.830 align:start position:0%
businesses um retail businesses selling
contact

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
contact
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
lenses and it's related to that issue
 
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
it's I mean that part where that change
 
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.190 align:start position:0%
it's I mean that part where that change
is

01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.950 align:start position:0%
is
[Music]

01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
um okay it
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
it says the U the office um shall issue
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
a permit to such outof State businesses
 
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
which I believe are businesses that are
 
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
selling in the state in the state
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
correct and uh one of the requirements
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
is the business complies with all lawful
 
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
directions and requests for information
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
from the Board of Pharmacy and the board
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
of Optometry or other applicable
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
licensing authority of all states which
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
conducts business so if they're require
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
if they are asked to provide information
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
from from the licensing bodies in their
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
other the other states where they
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
operate um they have to provide it but
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
the issue is um that's not always called
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
a board or whatever so each state has
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
their own language and this allows for
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
that so in regards to the clarification
 
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
of that so if I'm ordering my contacts
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
or my glasses online after getting
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
evaluation done by the optometrist or
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist here
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
that business that mails
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
me that this holds to that those
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
businesses that are not practicing here
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
e-commerce and then I can go back to my
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
optometrist to or the opthalmologist to
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
clarify yes this is the right thing that
 
01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
well I Mike I guess the question is look
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
at line eight uh seven and eight um for
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
the sale at retail of contact lenses to
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
individuals with the state does that
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
question I've never looked at that
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
question in detail but my understanding
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
would be if you're a business outside of
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
the state shipping into the state I
 
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
would think the answer would be yes okay
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you yeah you know my
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
kids order contacts and glasses they get
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
the evaluation done here and they would
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
order online it's much cheaper to get it
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
that way but they would go back to their
 
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
eye doctor to make sure that's the right
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
one so representative
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chair so oplc permits
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
businesses as nothing to do with the
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
certification of optometrist and
 
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist in this section correct
 
01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.310 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist in this section correct
thank

01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
you um if I may I yes I actually I
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed the new language on page seven
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
and I've got some recommended
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
changes okay there as well uh I'll just
 
01:17:16.990 --> 01:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
go through them real quick on line seven
 
01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:19.719 align:start position:0%
there's a floating and towards the end
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
of I that thank you um section B
 
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
establishment of an application process
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
under 31042 C the process lies with the
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
oplc so I would probably replace the
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
words and application process with the
 
01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.070 align:start position:0%
words and application process with the
word

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
criteria right keeping in line with the
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
board establishes the criteria the
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
office establishes the
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
process and I can give you my written
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
yeah that if you could actually email it
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
that would be great any others uh
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
sentence d uh same statute three 310
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
42c uh gives the office Authority around
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
the education so I I had stricken out
 
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
development of protocols for proctoring
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
and and I had left criteria for
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
requiring such proctoring that sentence
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
would obviously need to be tweaked we'd
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
have to probably Define proctoring I
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
think that came up earlier in testimony
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
that needs to be more clearly defined
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
and then in E uh implementation of an
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
outcome reporting I would change process
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
to requirements
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
because those would come in through the
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
office and then in section
 
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
two I had stricken the words on line 24
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
to the board of Optometry so that it
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
reads unless the op optometrist has
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
submitted evidence of satisfactory
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
completion and then I changed on line 25
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
board to office because that information
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
would come into
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
us okay thank you and if you could just
 
01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:53.239 align:start position:0%
uh send an email with those details okay
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
I will do that okay thank you other
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh represent M py sorry after
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
this I'll be very quiet uh it's hard um
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
so with this the process you're clearly
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
dealing what is the process for oplc
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
what is the process for the board Ru
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
making requirement uh professional
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
requirement is set by the
 
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
board and uh oplc just focuses on
 
01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.629 align:start position:0%
board and uh oplc just focuses on
licensing

01:19:25.629 --> 01:19:25.639 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
in the process correct would this in
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
your mind create a checks and balance to
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
see what the oplc is has another shot at
 
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
looking at what the applicant looks
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
like I I don't think we would be
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
establishing criteria in any way shape
 
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
or measure we would use the criteria
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
established by the board to make our
 
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
determinations and if it was a gray area
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
or if there was a question we would
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
bring that question to the board uh I
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
think my changes here simply keep keep
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
this bill in line with what we've done
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
in 655 409
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
Etc all right thank you representative
 
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
BR yeah I just I do want to make a
 
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
comment though because one of the things
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
that we did with House Bill
 
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
655 was um remove the um
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
subjectivity of applications of licenses
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
because what was happening was people
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
the board when they were doing this was
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
were interpreting
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
applicant um depending on essay
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
questions and that brought bias and
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
subjectivity into it so by taking the
 
01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
changing the criteria or making sure
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
that there are that it is um um
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
objective um that was part of the reason
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
why the the office is doing this OPP as
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to the board it SE it separates
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
them a little bit so there is it's I
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it's a check and balance
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
but it's a more robust process and more
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
fair right right another way to look at
 
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
it which might help is that uh what's in
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
statute combined with what the boards
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
create through rul making provides the
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
rules of how licensing and complaints
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
and everything else is supposed to be
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
done and the office basically just is
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
the Machinery that carries it out based
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
on those rules but they're not making
 
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
policy decisions because that's in
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
that would give the legislative body to
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
hold the process or
 
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.910 align:start position:0%
hold the process or
the

01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
indirectly to through oplc and through
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
the board that we have the oversight
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
responsib we're we're giving the board
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
The Authority where that they can do
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
rule making and then once that process
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
is done it's opl's job opl C's job to
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
carry it out anyone else
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
for this section not for this okay thank
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
you um the next section is actually at
 
01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page seven the same page
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
and going into the next page and this is
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
um or is this the one I'd already
 
01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
covered right that's the one sorry next
 
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
page page eight starting at line now we
 
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
already did that I'm off my page okay at
 
01:22:23.709 --> 01:22:23.719 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page eight towards the
 
01:22:23.719 --> 01:22:26.310 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page eight towards the
bottom

01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm getting there
 
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
um in line um
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
34 this is uh regard to the requirements
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
for continuing
 
01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.070 align:start position:0%
for continuing
education

01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
um in addition to those set by RSA 32733
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
and what what this
 
01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.830 align:start position:0%
and what what this
and

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
um what's on the next page including
 
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
line six
 
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.189 align:start position:0%
line six
is

01:22:56.189 --> 01:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
um some sort of rework to that so right
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
now there's
 
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
um I've got it here here yeah I've got
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
the well I'm looking actually at the
 
01:23:08.719 --> 01:23:10.669 align:start position:0%
the well I'm looking actually at the
statute

01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
um right now there the uh continued
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
education is broken up
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
into uh pharmaceutical versus
 
01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.669 align:start position:0%
into uh pharmaceutical versus
non-pharmaceutical

01:23:20.669 --> 01:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
non-pharmaceutical
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
also um gloma or
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
non-glaucoma and it it gets into how
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
that continuent education should be
 
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
split up and I think the general idea is
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
that that's should really be handled
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
through rul making I mean the statute
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
sets the the overall outline of that
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be some continuing
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
education uh but the details on it um
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't be in statute so what
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
this all does is it um it repeals 3 33
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
33a which is continued educations
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
required for pharmaceutical and glaucoma
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
certification and it changes 30 um
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
32733 to um just say uh continue
 
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
education courses required an
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
optometrist shall complete a minimum of
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
20 hours of contined Education by
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
participation in formal synchronous
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
courses each year in order to maintain
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
active licenses and there is I
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
3273 that's on Ru
 
01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:39.470 align:start position:0%
3273 that's on Ru
making

01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
um see I think there's something there
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
or or U else actually
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
it Roman 5 requirements for continue
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
education in addition to those
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
requirements set by RSA 32733 oh and
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
this needs to be well I got rid of the
 
01:25:02.109 --> 01:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
reference to 33a uh in the repeal
 
01:25:02.119 --> 01:25:04.030 align:start position:0%
reference to 33a uh in the repeal
so

01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:07.629 --> 01:25:07.639 align:start position:0%
um so basically through rulem the board
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
would set what are the requirements this
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
sets the overall amount but what are the
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
requirements what courses will meet the
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
requirements and that sort of thing so
 
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
any questions on
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
that okay representative Gro yeah
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
out so oh because okay because we're
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
amending different statutes it's all
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
kind of intermingled right all us may
 
01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.910 align:start position:0%
kind of intermingled right all us may
change

01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
order may change this to be more logical
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I I was I was amending I was
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
editing what was in place and right um
 
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah whe whether it's a separate
 
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
section and in whatever order um is is
 
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
so my question to you and maybe to
 
01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.870 align:start position:0%
so my question to you and maybe to
members

01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
here has the continuing education
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
courses for 20 hours is that has that
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
been current
 
01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
practice um well actually it was comp
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
you come up here but I I'll say
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
something first and and ask you to
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's a little actually why don't
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
you just answer so previously there were
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
separate classifications and there were
 
01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
there was a group of optometrists that
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
were not prescribing medications that
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
only needed 15 hours we're now
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
simplifying that everybody will need the
 
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
20 hours the 20 hours of live formal
 
01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
courses is what it has been all along um
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
again uh the SB 440 did eliminate in
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
from statute the board may still in Ru
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
making add other things but um there was
 
01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
an additional 30 hours of strictly
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
independent study that was really not
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
trackable and so that was removed from
 
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
statute but the statute will remain that
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
it is 20 hours and it is increasing from
 
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
15 to 20 so that it's 20 for
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
everybody okay and is it if it's 20 for
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
everybody oh followup sorry followup if
 
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:19.639 align:start position:0%
it's 20 for everybody for these people
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
who would might be certified to do the
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
new procedure would there still be
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
it may supersede yes it may supersede
 
01:27:30.189 --> 01:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
that the 20 is the minimum for everybody
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
and then the board can add additional
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
they may the board May specify when
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
they're doing these um the the ru making
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
for these procedures that some of that
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
20 might need to be in specific things
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
or they may need something beyond that
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
maintain okay so I'd like to beef that
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
up a little bit on the and and I'll try
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
to come up with some language because
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
the minimum of 20
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
hours just basically says that so we we
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
could put additional hours required for
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
within so it does specify that within
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
the new section that is being added 327
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
6D um that the board there would
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
establish minimum education for those
 
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
procedures so it does allow them there
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's within um the our new section 11
 
01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't have your current
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
draft to page number I've got to page 16
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
line 16 y page seven line 16 327 okay
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay1 and then the sub list it does
 
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
specifically indicate that they will
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
have education requirements specifically
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
for these procedures so that General 20
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
hours of education is for everybody
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
across the board but then maybe um
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
supplemented in R making okay I
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
understand yep as okay got it thank you
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
so much very
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
helpful okay so
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
um the uh that actually we've gone
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
through all of the proposed changes to
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
the bill so any other discussion on
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
this so one comment that I had are you
 
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
ask can I just jump in and take i i w
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
even raise my hand I'm so sorry um is
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
bill it
 
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
had what the bill did not
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
allow and I am I am I oh and I would
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
rather have it say what it allows I
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
think it has both okay it could it could
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
page three starting in line six yeah
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's got the practice of Optometry and
 
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
it lists the um you know part A lists
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
the things that they may do
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
and Part B lists the things that they
 
01:30:09.109 --> 01:30:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
do um
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
and go jump in all right uh
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
representative he had asked earlier
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative Brown sorry go
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
ahead okay
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair so
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
that's a question that I had based on
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
the on the 44 items in the back of one
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
of your books that optometrist were
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
do or the
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
220 codes that opthalmologists can
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
do is the way is the way this is written
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
now and and again we're all seeing this
 
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
first time this morning well not not
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
this part this is existing bill yeah no
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
I I understand that so the way that your
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment comes out the exemptions
 
01:30:56.669 --> 01:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
there's only a certain number of
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
exemptions does that still mean that
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
autometers can do everything else if the
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
board or is it only if the board says
 
01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
they can well first of all it's for them
 
01:31:09.149 --> 01:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
to do anything it's got to be covered in
 
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
part A starting at line seven right now
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
those are are
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
General and by the way the I the
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
amendment I propos does not change this
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
section whatsoever that's in the
 
01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
original Bill okay and and I guess I so
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
yes following up sir sorry certainly I I
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of my concerns
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
um we have to be clear on what is
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
allowed and what isn't allowed I guess
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
before the board gets to it because if
 
01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:38.990 align:start position:0%
before the board gets to it because if
this

01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
passes as it as whichever version if it
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
passes that be what is allowed or exempt
 
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
is irrelevant to Future rule making
 
01:31:52.030 --> 01:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
would that be accurate uh no actually if
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
you can come first and we'll get
 
01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
response again introduce yourself again
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
Yes again I'm Dr Angelique Sawyer um
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
North Conway H just a moment Simon had a
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
comment yeah if I could ask this just so
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
that you can cover it when you're
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
answering the question because I think
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
it'll kind of go in the same vein my
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
main concern with this section uh was
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not there was going to be
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
something that we're not considering at
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
the moment something that comes along in
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
the future um that isn't Exempted it
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
isn't in this list uh and what happens
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
with that when it comes up um you know
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
so is it going to be open for
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
optometrist to do that procedure simply
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
because it's not in the exclusion list
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
is that a possibility so the intention
 
01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
and hopefully this this clarifies so the
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
the list of exclusions the board cannot
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
go beyond that so if something came
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
along that was for example um a retinal
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
procedure a retinal surgery that would
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
still not be something that Optometry
 
01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
would be able to do um the new section
 
01:32:54.990 --> 01:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
that is being added that 3276 D of those
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
bullet points the first one is
 
01:32:59.470 --> 01:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
identification and categorization of the
 
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
Opthalmic procedures for the practice of
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
Optometry and so that is where the board
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
would specifically name those procedures
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
and so if something came along then a an
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
optometrist or someone would bring to
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
the board is this something that we're
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
able to do and it would go through rulem
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
to determine if that can be included in
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
the list that they're creating or
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
whether it is outside
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
and the the language in part one there
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
says that it must be consistent with
 
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum of nationally accredited
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
schools and colleges of Optometry so if
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
it is not something that is being taught
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
in an accredited school it is not
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
something the board would be able to do
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me where where were you sorry
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
that is all within um 3276 D um it was
 
01:33:46.109 --> 01:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
number section 11 of the bill I don't
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
have line numbers I think it's on S no
 
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's um nope wrong copy that's the
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
original bill so of course I'm not going
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
to find it 11 but but what she's
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
referring to is on page seven page yeah
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
yes so so one the board is held only to
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
what is taught in the accredited schools
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
and colleges of Optometry so if nothing
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
something new comes along that is not
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
being taught that is not something the
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
board can allow the board in um sub item
 
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
a there has um identification and
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
categorization of the the procedures for
 
01:34:27.149 --> 01:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
the practice of Optometry um and so that
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
is where the specific procedures would
 
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
be named rather than naming in statute
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
and having to come back and change
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
statute if a procedure had a change in
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
name or a subprocedure was developed the
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
board would be able to address through
 
01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:41.790 align:start position:0%
board would be able to address through
rule

01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
making Simon youe thank you yes and I
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
understand the process and thank you for
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
the clarification I guess my question is
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
more and for both sides actually is the
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
list exhaustive do does everybody see it
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
as exhaustive or is there something that
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
we might be missing that might pop up in
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
the future that's my concern that isn't
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
covered by any of the things that you've
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
said any of the caveats any of the
 
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
protections something that could fall
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of that because our
 
01:35:08.430 --> 01:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
job is to close those things up before
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
it gets to the board I'm happy to let
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
the board do the board's thing but you
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
know we need to make sure that we've
 
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
done our due diligence on the front side
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair if anybody is able to
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
mention something that they don't think
 
01:35:20.189 --> 01:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
is exhaustively covered in the list so
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
we could talk about that be helpful to
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
me this is the list of things that are
 
01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.229 align:start position:0%
me this is the list of things that are
not

01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
permitted right that's something that
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
should be added that is not in there
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
right something should be added to do
 
01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
this list yes we are are open to adding
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
more exclusions if there's things that
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
anyone feels have been left off the
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
table that need to be included there
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
okay and before we go on anyse
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
representative BR did you have a
 
01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
question okay because this is what so
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at page three of the thing
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
that everybody is looking at right now
 
01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.430 align:start position:0%
that everybody is looking at right now
which

01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
has not changed from the original
 
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
bill which starts with okay at the top
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
section four practice of
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
otomet so all of these things are these
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
things like 1 2 3 4 and five have these
 
01:36:15.629 --> 01:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
things are these things changing as a
 
01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
result of this bill or the the things
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
that you've always done those in part A
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
items 1 2 3 four and five are things
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
that we've always done okay okay the
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
only uh change other than um because the
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
B was added they had it an A and then
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
change the headings I understand the the
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
other change is um removal of the the
 
01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
words other than surgery in uh in a
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
which is which which is a big change
 
01:36:42.669 --> 01:36:42.679 align:start position:0%
required for we're to which is why the
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
new section oh yes okay but then in B
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
and then we struck out F which is the
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
acute angle closure of glaucoma which we
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
heard as many times s Hearing I still
 
01:36:57.149 --> 01:36:57.159 align:start position:0%
don't know what that is but we're you're
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
saying that you you are not going to
 
01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
diagnose that we we can diagnose that um
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
so it it it specifically in the past
 
01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
said that when it was diagnosed it then
 
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
required immediate referral to an
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist if the procedures are
 
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
permitted and the optometrist can
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
perform that laser surgery then that
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
referral to an opthalmologist
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
immediately in that moment it it would
 
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
would either go to an opthalmologist or
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
somebody who's able to perform that
 
01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.990 align:start position:0%
somebody who's able to perform that
procedure

01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead representa Brown excuse me
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yeah represent Brown I'm kind
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
of talking to myself I guess so that
 
01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
strikeout on line 19 through 21 yes of
 
01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.350 align:start position:0%
strikeout on line 19 through 21 yes of
the

01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis then your ability to do that
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
falls back to number one yes that would
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
be included in number one yes exactly
 
01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.990 align:start position:0%
be included in number one yes exactly
thank

01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm not I'm going finish with
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
he just jumped in that's okay that's all
 
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
right just
 
01:37:57.629 --> 01:37:57.639 align:start position:0%
pausing I think you're a member of this
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
committee and I am not I'm an I'm an
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
interloper um from rep and then from
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
line 22 it shall not
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
mean the following and it lists all
 
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
these things that you cannot do and it
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
goes all the way to the next page yes
 
01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:18.830 align:start position:0%
goes all the way to the next page yes
right

01:38:18.830 --> 01:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
so is there anything else on this list
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
that's the point that we're trying to
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
that you are not you would not be able
 
01:38:37.229 --> 01:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
to do based on your
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
training whether it's there there under
 
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
the criteria that we just established
 
01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
yep um there may be things that are
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
outside of our training that our board
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
would not authorize to do that are not
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily excluded Ed here and if they
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
if that is the case it's an oversight
 
01:38:59.070 --> 01:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
our attempt is to exclude things that
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
are not within our training right um but
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
because training is um continually uh
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
advancing um the the
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
board would limit
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
to only things that are within the
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
training and that are not excluded by
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
here and to my knowledge there are not
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
other procedures out there that we are
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
aiming to do that are not being
 
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
addressed by this or that the board is
 
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
not planning to list out in Ru making
 
01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.030 align:start position:0%
not planning to list out in Ru making
ask

01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you so according to this
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
any procedure that requires general
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
anesthesia you were not allowed to give
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
general anesthesia good okay and then
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
followup yes they are not correct
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
that is correct correct we are not able
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
to but you are do they give I don't know
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
like topical anesthesia to the eye
 
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
topical anesthesia yes and and would you
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
be trained for that
 
01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
yes okay um I think that's it for right
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
now but but I still would like to have a
 
01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
list of things that they can do because
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it's three laser
 
01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:20.709 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it's three laser
three

01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
lasers something to do with a map can um
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
we we can share with you what the board
 
01:40:30.109 --> 01:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
has drafted so far where that list is I
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
just got that from is
 
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
forming um okay because I think that
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's it rather oh yag not map yag that's
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay um so because there are surgeries
 
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
so let's just use the example of the
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
three lasers right how many I have no
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
idea how many lasers are there um Can
 
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
the laser that's used to do something
 
01:40:59.070 --> 01:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
that you can do can it be used for
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
something that you can't do or are these
 
01:41:06.109 --> 01:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
lasers process specific procedure
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
specific right they're there maybe now
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
and there may be development of other
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
uses for the lasers but they would not
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
we're not permitted to just freely use a
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
laser we are permitted for a specific
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
procedure by the board where they're
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
naming out this yag capsulotomy proced
 
01:41:25.149 --> 01:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
procedure is what you would be able to
 
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
do and if that laser develops a new
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
purpose or a new use they would only be
 
01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:32.679 align:start position:0%
able to do it once authorized by the
 
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
board once the board has included that
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
in the list of procedures that fall
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
under the
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
through so this is this is the part that
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
can that concerns me
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
because if for example I'm going to go
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
back to the Splinter all right let's say
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
even though it's a terrible analogy but
 
01:41:57.149 --> 01:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
I can't think of anything
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
else the let's say the laser can REM can
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
remove the Splinter but then let's say
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
the the laser can fix the tendon in my
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
finger the same
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
laser so the person that owns the laser
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
can use it to take the splinter
 
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
out but then at what point
 
01:42:24.189 --> 01:42:24.199 align:start position:0%
does Optometry
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
training enter a realm of
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology and their
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
training and at at one point because
 
01:42:41.159 --> 01:42:44.629 align:start position:0%
training and at at one point because
obviously

01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists study the eye as well
 
01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
Specialties and they're trained for
 
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
those and you're trained for yours and
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to even though it's an awful
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
analogy I'm also going to use a ladder
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
so you know you're you're stepping up
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
the ladder and is there are we at the
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
point is this bill and it sounds to me
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
that this does is that it overlaps some
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the responsibilities of The Optimist
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
optometrist in those sections of
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
procedures that
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
are less grisky than others obviously if
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
your Reen is detached that's a big deal
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
and you know you got to go right but
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the width of that
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
band would grow with time I guess but
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that we have to you're
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
looking at me like no I'm looking at
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
Tony no no no I'm I'm trying to get
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
understand I'm trying I guess my concern
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
is that a good investigation it's I just
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.990 --> 01:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call it capability creep
 
01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't go beyond your capability and
 
01:44:03.589 --> 01:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
how do we safeguard that absolutely so
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
in your example with the Splinter and
 
01:44:08.189 --> 01:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
then the laser could do something
 
01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
more there are procedure codes removal
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
of that splinter is one procedure repair
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
of the tissue or going down into the
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
tendon or doing something different is
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
another procedure okay that makes sense
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
so so through procedure codes um is
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
where the board would be identifying
 
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
these are the things that are approved
 
01:44:34.589 --> 01:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
um through that part A of the
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
identification of procedures okay okay
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
any other qu um but I saw hands and when
 
01:44:43.950 --> 01:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
we're done with questions for this
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
person I'll let somebody else on the
 
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
other side respond we know or comment um
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
he had asked representative Brown and
 
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
then representative M boy and most or
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
gold and then M yep thank you Mr chair
 
01:44:59.310 --> 01:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
so for everyone my my concern about this
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
is that I don't
 
01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
understand how let's use a simple
 
01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:08.679 align:start position:0%
example in a residency for an
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist how many times have you
 
01:45:13.149 --> 01:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
used a scalpel on a live person to
 
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
practice a
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
procedure and for an optometrist that
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
wants to do that same procedure that has
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
never had that amount of training
 
01:45:26.669 --> 01:45:26.679 align:start position:0%
how can you guarantee me to me that you
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
will get that before you do that
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
procedure I I don't even know what the
 
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
numbers are so um the we I believe we
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
have the acgme chart of the procedures
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the number of
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
codes um if we have not provided that we
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
can we can get that um they have a long
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
list of of requirements and we've
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
highlighted the only four procedures on
 
01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
that list that we would be anticipating
 
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
doing that are the rest are excluded by
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
the list of
 
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
exclusions and okay and and to follow up
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
I let me try a more General answer and
 
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
then you can ask anything to Follows so
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
the section on page
 
01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
um that they're not allowed to to do any
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
procedure unless they you know the the
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
board is going to has rul making they're
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
required to do rule making to categorize
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
theic procedures into presumably groups
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
so they're not dealing with every one of
 
01:46:39.550 --> 01:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
these things yeah and then they um will
 
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
establish criteria to uh for
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
certification to perform those
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
procedures and establish a minimum
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
education training and live experience
 
01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
requirements for certification perform
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
such procedures I guess that's my
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
question and and that's and that's
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and if they perform the
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
procedure without that certification
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's a disciplinary offense but that's
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
too late well sorry but that's too late
 
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
for the patient I mean you can't any
 
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is anyone can break
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
the law and we can't how do you prevent
 
01:47:13.790 --> 01:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
someone from breaking the law ahead of
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
time in any realm all you can do is is
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
provide deterrence and deal with the
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
case where it happens at least that's my
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
take represent groa
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make a comment about
 
01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:25.990 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make a comment about
this

01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
because I do believe that people in the
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
healthc care industry care about people
 
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and they're not going to just like
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
I would not remove a splinter from you
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
know my finger because I am not I would
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
not feel qualified to do
 
01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
that most
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
people if they have any Humanity at all
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
are going to care about a procedure on
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
someone's eye on whether or not they're
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
qualified I mean my goodness have we do
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
we have such a low opinion of our own
 
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
professions and our own individuality
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
that we would think something like that
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
I hope not and and actually a related
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
question related to that is I think you
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned before but I believe the
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
training for optometrist and I'm sure
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
for optomologist includes some uh
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
training on the issue of Ethics is that
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
not correct 100% yes we take an oath to
 
01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
we we take an OP metric oath to care for
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
our patients and that includes ethics
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
within the
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
oath okay
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
um yes repr I'm gold y thank you Mr
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to get my head around
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
is the lists of prohibited and the lists
 
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
of permitted and and
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
particularly first of all let me say
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
what I love about this process is I
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
think it's been an incredible
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
educational process for everybody about
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
how these systems work and and what our
 
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
role is and what everybody else's role
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
what the boards do Ru making all of that
 
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
both for some people in the audience and
 
01:49:08.589 --> 01:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
for some of the newer committee members
 
01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
but what I'm struggling with here
 
01:49:18.430 --> 01:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
statutes set up in a way that allows the
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
board to exercise the kind of
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
professionalism that I think
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative groda just laid out
 
01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
ethics Integrity
 
01:49:37.149 --> 01:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
professionalism and not bind our boards
 
01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:39.639 align:start position:0%
to having to come back to this body and
 
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
us to have to listen to and educate the
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
next reiteration of
 
01:49:45.719 --> 01:49:47.390 align:start position:0%
next reiteration of
fearful

01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
fearful
 
01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
public and professionals why why do we
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
have to have these exact list lists in
 
01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:55.159 align:start position:0%
here is this
 
01:49:55.159 --> 01:49:57.510 align:start position:0%
here is this
because

01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's turf or fear things going on
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
that we're having to
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
protect the obstacles that have been
 
01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
discussed I'm trying to understand why
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
these specific items need to be in this
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill why the exclusions need to be there
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and also the permissi so the the
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
exclusions are there for reassurance
 
01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
I believe that if these exclusions were
 
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
not here in the statute the board would
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
still Implement these exclusions because
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
these are not within our Education and
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
Training um but at this point we wanted
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
to leave in statute where those who have
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
concerns about this can see that there
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
are still parameters that the board has
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
to operate within including things that
 
01:50:51.149 --> 01:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
we know are not in the Education and
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
Training of any optometrist at this
 
01:50:55.709 --> 01:50:55.719 align:start position:0%
point so those are being excluded and
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
then giving the board The Authority
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
outside of those exclusions to within
 
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
Education and Training and within a very
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
thorough rul making procedure to prove
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
the education to prove that it's being
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
taught in accredited schools to prove
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
that there is live experience and if
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's a procedure that we can't get
 
01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
live experience then that's a procedure
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
that we may not be doing that the board
 
01:51:22.350 --> 01:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
may not be able to authorize so thank
 
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
you follow up so follow um I like the
 
01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.149 align:start position:0%
you follow up so follow um I like the
idea

01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
of the the more General I guess is the
 
01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
right way to say it the more um or
 
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
procedural coverage if it's trained by
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
an accreditated school what I'm
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about is on the exclusion list
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
and and I trust you you know this I
 
01:51:47.069 --> 01:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
don't want to know this I don't want to
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
become an expert in your
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
Fields um are you really certain that
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
this list of exclusions is not something
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
that is going to we've talked about the
 
01:51:59.790 --> 01:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
training the educational facilities are
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
going to be uh upping their game as
 
01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
we're breaking new ground in allowing
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
more procedures to be done by you all
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
are you confident that these should be
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
on that list I I am confident that at
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
this point and for the foreseeable near
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
future for what is being taught in
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
schools at this point that these
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
exclusions um are are not going to
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
create more barriers
 
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and for as a Native American
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh the next seven generations are we
 
01:52:30.069 --> 01:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
look at so thank you thank you uh you
 
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
still have a represent M py thank you Mr
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for um taking my
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
question again I will go to page three
 
01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:42.790 align:start position:0%
question again I will go to page three
line

01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
22 it says shall not mean the following
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
Opthalmic surgery procedures except for
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
the pre-operative and postoperative care
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
which means there is a collaborative
 
01:53:00.990 --> 01:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
effort to work with the
 
01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.270 align:start position:0%
effort to work with the
opthalmologist

01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist
 
01:53:06.990 --> 01:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
and does that
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
still work in the it it's a team effort
 
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
right super specialty should not become
 
01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:16.229 align:start position:0%
right super specialty should not become
more

01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:53:21.149 --> 01:53:21.159 align:start position:0%
siloed and so would this
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that the optomet and the
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology can still coexist and work
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
collaboratively for a better outcome and
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
safety for all who need the care in I
 
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
can only address it for the granite
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
state I I certainly hope so I certainly
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
I have very valuable trusted
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
relationships with providers that I
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
refer to and that I'm going to need to
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
continue to refer to um and I um want
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
all of them to know that that trust will
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
continue to be there there may be some
 
01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
of these procedures that are excluded
 
01:54:01.709 --> 01:54:01.719 align:start position:0%
that we don't provide even the pre- and
 
01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:03.639 align:start position:0%
postoperative care of because that's
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
beyond our expertise and that they are
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
best in those risky complicated
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
situations staying with that surgeon for
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
even the pre- and postoperative Care um
 
01:54:15.229 --> 01:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
but this does leave it open for when
 
01:54:18.750 --> 01:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
there is the the mutual relationship
 
01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
there and the the optometrist can
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
provide pre- and post operative Care at
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
the surgeon's discretion we want that to
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
continue and we we hope that that will
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
sides you r i i i i look I read that
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
language very carefully and it's it's I
 
01:54:40.589 --> 01:54:40.599 align:start position:0%
mean it's just perfectly obvious that if
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
you are a an eye person okay and you
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
look at the person's eye and you say wow
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to need something more that
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
I can't do that's Prett pre operative
 
01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
you're going like holy hell get Dr X on
 
01:55:00.189 --> 01:55:00.199 align:start position:0%
the line okay and once you've had the
 
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
procedure then the that you're you're
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
looking at their eye about something
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
completely different later that's all
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
postoperative I mean it's just as
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
obvious as you know don't dive off the
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
pool until the diving board without
 
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
checking for water in the pool you know
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
so let me let me kind of expand on that
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
and actually ask a question and that is
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
are there some procedures that
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists do today where they work
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
with optometrist to do at least some
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
part of the preoperative and
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
post-operative care that's planned
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's not if a problem is found yes um
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
cataract surgery is the most common
 
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
particularly in my area my surgeons are
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
an hour away from the Berlin office so
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
um if you need cataract surgery you are
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
traveling um when it is a
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
straightforward case that the surgeon is
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable with me taking over the
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
postoperative care they do not need to
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
go back to their surgeon for their
 
01:55:58.069 --> 01:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
follow-ups um and so that is that is a
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
very common practice throughout the
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
state both pre and postoperatively okay
 
01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for Dr
 
01:56:07.629 --> 01:56:07.639 align:start position:0%
Sawyer all right oh wait represent groa
 
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:11.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um on okay so going to the
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
part where it
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
says we're pre-operative and
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
postoperative care of and it says retina
 
01:56:22.589 --> 01:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
laser procedures penetrating care to PL
 
01:56:27.069 --> 01:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
y or qu all those F from a to F do you
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
assist now on these for some of them yes
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
not all of them um
 
01:56:38.430 --> 01:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
sorry uh most commonly we do pre- impost
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
operative care for refractive surgery um
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
we do uh pre- and postoperative Care um
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
if uh you if somebody has had a corneal
 
01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
transplant usually they're going to stay
 
01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
pretty close to their surgeon for a
 
01:56:53.709 --> 01:56:53.719 align:start position:0%
while but there does come a point where
 
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
they are transferred back to their
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
optometrist um usually if it's a
 
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
procedure that has required general
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
anesthesia the majority of that um
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up care that postoperative care
 
01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
is likely going to be held close to the
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
surgeon so um but but some of these
 
01:57:13.709 --> 01:57:13.719 align:start position:0%
yes follow and I don't see cataract
 
01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
surgery here is that um under subsection
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
the um part two the following non- laser
 
01:57:21.719 --> 01:57:23.149 align:start position:0%
the um part two the following non- laser
surgery

01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
01:57:27.149 --> 01:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
the um line f is extraction of the
 
01:57:30.189 --> 01:57:30.199 align:start position:0%
crystalline lens and G is surgical
 
01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
interocular implants okay got it thank
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for uh Dr
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
s okay thank you and if one person um
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
and some opthalmologist would like to
 
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
section yes I do um the blue books so
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's this thing yeah and yeah please
 
01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:57.149 align:start position:0%
that's this thing yeah and yeah please
introduce

01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
yourself hi my name is Anthony KY I'm an
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist at New Hampshire ey
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
Associates in Manchester thank you for
 
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
giving me opportunity to speak today um
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
so a couple of things on the
 
01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
exclusionary wrist I I know it's a
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
confusing part of the language in the
 
01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
bill and we we found it equally
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
confusing our initially our panel had
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
looked at that exclusionary list
 
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
identified over 250 Opthalmic procedures
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
that uh would be permissible under the
 
01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:22.910 align:start position:0%
that uh would be permissible under the
statute

01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
we spoke with the optometrist and they
 
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
provide us a list of 44 which is in the
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
very back section of your blue book it's
 
01:58:29.950 --> 01:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
in a yellow it's highlighted in yellow
 
01:58:31.629 --> 01:58:31.639 align:start position:0%
so the green part is what they can do
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
now uh it's the very back page 36 36
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else need one
 
01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
good um so in that if there's any
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
question about what they're asking to do
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
now we were tasked with the uh with the
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh my speaker Packer to look at each one
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
of these and decide if it was anything
 
01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
we could permit optometrist to perform
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
and in your sen I I'd like to correct
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
your language you're not in a position
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
to permit or not permit anything okay my
 
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
apologies yeah um uh he asked us to uh
 
01:59:04.430 --> 01:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
look at the procedure list and comment
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
um in that list he we identified four uh
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
we find identified four procedures that
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
we identified as safe and minor um with
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
regards to the exclusionary list though
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
I do want to get back to it because it
 
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:16.719 align:start position:0%
is an interesting uh topic and we were
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
looking at other other organizations or
 
01:59:20.589 --> 01:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
other uh governing boards in New
 
01:59:22.830 --> 01:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including podiatrist
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
and um dentistry and when you look at
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
their governing board you look at their
 
01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
scope of practice they Divine as
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
inclusionary so for example Podiatry if
 
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
you look at their inclusionary language
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
and I won't go through the whole um
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
whole statute but it defends it as
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
surgical means and ailments of the human
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
foot and lower leg so the analogy here
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
and the concern we have is that you're
 
01:59:44.069 --> 01:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
almost saying like a podiatrist well you
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
you can't do the head you can't do the
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
chest you can't do the
 
01:59:51.390 --> 01:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
abdomen well does that mean you can do
 
01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
the hip does that that mean you can do
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
the knee it's a it's a confusing part CU
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
in our world this is say saying the same
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
thing here that where there's so many
 
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
unknowns as to how many procedures will
 
02:00:05.229 --> 02:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
be allowed by sen up Bill 440 um excuse
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
me that's number one I wanted to go back
 
02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
if we could to the uh uh the uh first of
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
all I I appreciate your folks putting
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
the time into this we've only seen this
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
new Amendment for about an hour and a
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
half so we're kind of going through it
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
here and I apologize um if I if I
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
misspeak but uh the the uh exoskeleton
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh that was disced
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
um there was a mention of the acgme
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
requirements um were utilized I guess as
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
part of that I do want to mention about
 
02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
the acgme in in their statute or in
 
02:00:31.950 --> 02:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
their in their rules they they do Define
 
02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
minimum numbers represent what the RW
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
committee believes to be an acceptable
 
02:00:37.870 --> 02:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
minimal experience minimum numbers are
 
02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
not a final Target number and
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
achievement does not signific uh exuse
 
02:00:44.189 --> 02:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
me signific signify competence so in
 
02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
other words the the acgm accredits these
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
residency programs with a minimum
 
02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
standard but it's actually up to The
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
Residency program director to um
 
02:00:52.159 --> 02:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
Residency program director to um
determine

02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
determine
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
competency uh with regards to surgical
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
residency programs and Optometry we're
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
still a bit confused by this uh I I know
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
they have residency programs but I you
 
02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
know to to say that there's a equivalent
 
02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
to an Opthalmology Residency program
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
where they're accredited whether they're
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
licensed me Li uh accredited mentored uh
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
and have a minimum case number I we we
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
don't we have not seen that to exist and
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
we don't feel that the you know equating
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
the quinal residency programs that are
 
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
exist now are similar to the surgical
 
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
residency programs that we go through in
 
02:01:28.069 --> 02:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
terms of accreditation in terms of
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
minimal surgical uh
 
02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
volume and uh yeah lastly I I have to
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
look at the exoskeleton details more
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
more uh closely but the uh I I think it
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
would be very hard to to create recreate
 
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
The Residency experience with you know
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
anything that wasn't mentored you know
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
that wasn't supervised that didn't have
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
live patient experience and I I haven't
 
02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
looked at the details but I I look
 
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
forward to hearing more about it so ly
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
and that's all I wanted to say today all
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
right all I'd say is that um you know in
 
02:02:03.709 --> 02:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh what's uh the new part new 327 6D
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
um it it requires
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
um you know live experience and it
 
02:02:14.069 --> 02:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
requires um that they're going to be um
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
it says proctoring the language may
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
change but basically or we need actually
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
need to talk about that but uh you know
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
they're not just going to be having
 
02:02:22.830 --> 02:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
these live EXP experiences on their own
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
without somebody watching what they're
 
02:02:26.910 --> 02:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
doing and directing what they're doing
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's in there and um and the
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
board is charged with rulemaking for the
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
details of all of these so that before
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
any optometrist can do any of this that
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
has to be completed and um I mean I
 
02:02:43.870 --> 02:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
suspect I I'm not that familiar with the
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh bard of meeses any Board of Medicine
 
02:02:49.069 --> 02:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
statutes that are directly related to
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists but correct me if I'm
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
wrong but are the details of um criteria
 
02:02:58.350 --> 02:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
for opthalmologists do any particular
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
procedure uh laid out in statute no they
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
are not I right and uh I don't even know
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
if they're laid out in
 
02:03:08.669 --> 02:03:08.679 align:start position:0%
rules yeah our competency comes from the
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
The Residency experience and having uh
 
02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
essentially passing the test of three
 
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
years of residency that's where our I
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
guess our I think because at least at
 
02:03:18.669 --> 02:03:18.679 align:start position:0%
this point with optometrist and I you
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
know if I'm misstating something let me
 
02:03:22.350 --> 02:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
that isn't fully developed because it
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't be because many states would
 
02:03:30.510 --> 02:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
not permit it um the you know the
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
requirement is that the board and again
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
everybody will have input on this rul
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
making the board is directed to provide
 
02:03:41.950 --> 02:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
Ru making on this and you know as
 
02:03:44.109 --> 02:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
they've expressed it they'll presum be
 
02:03:47.229 --> 02:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
guided by um you know the optometrist
 
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
certification organization now and also
 
02:03:52.549 --> 02:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
for the other procedures by the uh the
 
02:03:53.549 --> 02:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
one for the
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists and then you know and
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
that even that's just um you know and
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
set the minimums for that
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's that's it's it's
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
not there's more to it I think than than
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
you seem to be indicating in which
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
saying that's my only point on that um
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
um so uh represent groa uh Brown and MTI
 
02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
unless there's somebody else so on your
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
in this book some of these proposed
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
codes are are in yellow and some are in
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
green why is that the green is what they
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
are uh by Statute allowed to do now and
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
the yellow is what they are uh asking
 
02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:36.679 align:start position:0%
right and when you negoti when this this
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
whole one of the reasons why we there
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
was supposed toly a negotiation between
 
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
so what of these yellow ones were you
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
going to did you concede that would be
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay um if you go to the introduction
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
section so if you go to page uh it is
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
Page four of the booklet yeah uh the
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
four CPT code listed at the top of that
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
booklet so four yes out of the out of
 
02:05:00.079 --> 02:05:02.030 align:start position:0%
booklet so four yes out of the out of
the

02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:05.549 --> 02:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
44 yeah we convened a panel of ocul
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
plastics uh corne and glaucoma
 
02:05:09.069 --> 02:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
specialist to review that thoroughly
 
02:05:10.189 --> 02:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions actually
 
02:05:16.030 --> 02:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
there were some others or brown okay
 
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so you may be you may
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
not be able to answer this but maybe
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
can uh as you go through a surgical
 
02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
residency obviously you have X amount of
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
hours and you do all this
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
work if you don't get if an optometrist
 
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
for example didn't get the amount of
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
practice uh for particular surgical
 
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
techniques how is that going to happen
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
afterwards you're out of school you're
 
02:05:46.750 --> 02:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
now an optometrist how do you get that
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hands-On where do you go to get that
 
02:05:52.109 --> 02:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
Hands-On patient live patient work I
 
02:05:53.950 --> 02:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
think that could most appropriately be
 
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
answered by uh Dr Sawyer or someone on
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
that side because
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I mean to answer that we're not
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
aware of any accredited uh surgical
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
residencies in Optometry that and as as
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
Dr CLE had mentioned you know that there
 
02:06:11.149 --> 02:06:11.159 align:start position:0%
is no minimum quote unquote minimum uh
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
at the testimony he metion there's no
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
minimum either but we're not aware of
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
any accredit that you can equate to a
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology surgical residency that
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
exists yeah well we'll get someone else
 
02:06:22.510 --> 02:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
up to
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
no and I and I I understand I understand
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
that for sure thank you um someone
 
02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:32.310 align:start position:0%
that for sure thank you um someone
else

02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh represent
 
02:06:37.629 --> 02:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
Mony thank you uh Mr chair thank you for
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
02:06:44.109 --> 02:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
question um again I'll go back to the
 
02:06:46.189 --> 02:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
section where it
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
says shall not mean the following
 
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
optomic surgery procedures except for
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
the pre-operative
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
postoperative So
 
02:06:59.950 --> 02:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
currently there are many practices many
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
hospitals and private
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
practices like Nashi Associates there
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
are 10
 
02:07:09.310 --> 02:07:09.320 align:start position:0%
optometrist 14
 
02:07:12.069 --> 02:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists with oil specialty
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
working together right yes including my
 
02:07:18.510 --> 02:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
practice yes
 
02:07:23.709 --> 02:07:23.719 align:start position:0%
so do you see any op obstacle because
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
for me it's important that we don't
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
create more
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
silos saying you know I'm left thumb
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
specialist so I don't you know I only do
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
this the super Specialties started with
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
the intention of working as a team so I
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
am seeing some or is it my own
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
perception that I'm seeing that thing
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
this is my territory this is your
 
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
territory the territorial thing where
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
the patient is going to be compromised
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
not getting the much needed care at this
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
time is do you see anything like that
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
with this if this bill passes with all
 
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
the Amendments with all the
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
inclusions I I go back to the you know
 
02:08:20.229 --> 02:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
again this the the exoscale was
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned I I go back to you know what
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
we we know is the you know the standard
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
in in Opthalmology is the you know
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
certified res uh residency experience
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
17,000 hours mentored uh with you know
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and and display of
 
02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
Competency um and I I would I would
 
02:08:39.390 --> 02:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
would be uh you know lying to if I
 
02:08:41.549 --> 02:08:41.559 align:start position:0%
didn't say if that if there was a a
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
pathway we just don't see I don't see a
 
02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
a similar model set up that would allow
 
02:08:51.229 --> 02:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
that level of of of um of um training in
 
02:08:54.589 --> 02:08:54.599 align:start position:0%
in in the in in the current
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
system follow with that just that one
 
02:09:00.270 --> 02:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah so this is it says it's
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
not doing this surgery it's pre and post
 
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
care they might not even optometrist may
 
02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
not even do the pre and post care is
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
there room for that collaboration to say
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
you know optometrist can bring it up to
 
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
this level with the current education
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
with the current technology iCal uh
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
advancements in the field of Opthalmic
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
procedures just if I take just the
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
contacts it used to be that hard glass
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
you have to take clean it now you can
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
wear it for 30
 
02:09:42.990 --> 02:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
days yeah in the relationship has always
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
been very collaborative I I I I don't
 
02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
discount that I mean the Optometry and
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
our practice see medic managed medical
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
diseases they they medically managed
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
glaucoma and it's extremely
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
collaborative I I think the analogy
 
02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
earlier was that that ladder that we
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
were talking about like how far up the
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
ladder and I you know we you know we'
 
02:10:00.189 --> 02:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
we've we've said before that you know
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
when the you know surgical when you're
 
02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
talking about lasers and surgery you
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
know potentially you know blinding
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
procedures here where their margin of
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
error is so small it it really requires
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
a a level of experience and and and
 
02:10:13.229 --> 02:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
surgical training that you know again we
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
we we do in
 
02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
residency all right um at this point I
 
02:10:20.589 --> 02:10:20.599 align:start position:0%
think we're going to take a short caucus
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative Brown and Bailey we're
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
going to go in the office there and
 
02:10:27.149 --> 02:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
representative Gro where you want to go
 
02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
so we'll be back I I don't expect and
 
02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.119 --> 02:13:20.109 align:start position:0%

02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
on uh Senate Bill
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
440 and um I'm going to make a
 
02:28:00.349 --> 02:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
motion which is that we accept the
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
amended language um that I sent out have
 
02:28:07.389 --> 02:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
to have an actual official um Amendment
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
drafted by OS for before next Wednesday
 
02:28:14.910 --> 02:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
and with um the technical language
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
changes that were requested by oplc for
 
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
um the section 327 6D just to make clear
 
02:28:26.790 --> 02:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
what's the responsibility the board
 
02:28:28.590 --> 02:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
versus um the
 
02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
office and um there may be some uh
 
02:28:36.349 --> 02:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
technical changes the exact descriptions
 
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
of some items on the exclusionary list
 
02:28:41.469 --> 02:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
and um and those would be in there as
 
02:28:43.630 --> 02:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
well but that that's what I'm that's
 
02:28:47.550 --> 02:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
what the motion is um do I have a
 
02:28:50.590 --> 02:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
second okay clarification Mr
 
02:28:54.910 --> 02:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
chair yeah so well actually I'll you're
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
making a motion for an amendment that
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
will have all the changes that we
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
discussed as an amendment corre not as
 
02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
an amended bill that we have right now
 
02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:13.070 --> 02:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
um all right I'm just making some notes
 
02:29:16.950 --> 02:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
here and then all right
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
so and this is uh just the members
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
official members of the sub committee to
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
vote um all who are in favor discussion
 
02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
or well actually we can have some
 
02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
discussion if you like sorry any
 
02:29:32.349 --> 02:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
discussion yes thank you Mr chair so uh
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
we talked about this obviously in the
 
02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:34.790 align:start position:0%
we talked about this obviously in the
back

02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
room um I'm oh we can't no you can't
 
02:29:40.510 --> 02:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
talk about happening con no no it's a
 
02:29:43.230 --> 02:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
secret I'm not telling you rules rules
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
rules yeah I'm going to vote for this
 
02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
with the understanding from
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative Simons back of the room
 
02:29:54.790 --> 02:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
conversations and and the way I believe
 
02:29:57.190 --> 02:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
the bill reads after having a
 
02:30:00.349 --> 02:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
conversation that the live experience
 
02:30:03.150 --> 02:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
requirements that will come through rul
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
making however that works however you're
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
going to get your live

not

02:30:11.790 --> 02:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:30:14.429 --> 02:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
allowing anyone to do these procedures
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's not that's not
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
qualified thank you Mr chair right and I
 
02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
think that's pretty clear in statute U
 
02:30:23.590 --> 02:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
on if they're told they can't do it and
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
if they do there's disciplinary action
 
02:30:27.790 --> 02:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
so I think that will assure that any
 
02:30:30.670 --> 02:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
other discussion represent maputi um I
 
02:30:34.269 --> 02:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
will support the amended
 
02:30:38.190 --> 02:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
version with the understanding that the
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort between the
 
02:30:43.830 --> 02:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist and the optometrist will
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
enhance not create more isolation so the
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort
 
02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
that would benefit the granite
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
Staters to get the best possible Care at
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%

02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
most as quickly as possible and as
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
reasonably as possible so that's with
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
that intention with that
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
