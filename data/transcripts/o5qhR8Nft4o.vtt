again Mr chair um the bonding process is
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
an existentially important process for
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
Citizens across the state uh frequently
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
often involving many many millions of
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
dollars the taxpayers will end up having
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
to pay back over a period of many years
 
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
um in order to reach a yes decision on
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
the passage of a bond it should require
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
a two-thirds majority and not a simple
 
00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
majority because it is such a an
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
important matter thank you Mr chair
 
00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:03.030 align:start position:0%

2third uh requirement

seconds and you may speak to your
 
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600 align:start position:0%

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.310 align:start position:0%
HB uh so hb1
1297

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
1297
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
is uh bipart uh bipartisan legislation
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
basically um setting some guidelines for
 
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
basically um setting some guidelines for
um

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
Municipal R making
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
um so uh specifically for zoning
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
ordinances um it
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
basically um just says zoning
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
ordinances um should be for the
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
promotion of residents health and safety
 
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.030 align:start position:0%
promotion of residents health and safety
um

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
so in other
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
words um I I um
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
basically if it's an ordinance that's
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
just about someone's aesthetic
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
preferences or whatever then that isn't
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
really a valid use for um Municipal
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
ordinance making um I basically just see
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
this as a codification
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
of how governments should be um
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
legislating anyways um you know it's
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
a um it's a princip all that sees it's
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
an expression from uh lots of political
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
philosophers I believe Prime sponsor
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
called it
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh ref referred to um lafayette's
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
principle for it um I was thinking more
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
of John Stewart Mills harm principle um
 
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.350 align:start position:0%
of John Stewart Mills harm principle um
about

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
basically intervening in other people's
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
Affairs should only be to prevent harm
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
to others rather than harm to
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
themselves um
 
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
um I yeah I basically just see this as a
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
pretty basic statement of principles and
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
think it would make sense to
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
pass thank
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
you representative uh
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman for taking
 
00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:56.839 align:start position:0%
my question my comment I will be voting
 
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
against hb12 97 because it is in direct
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
conflict um with our existing statutes
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
on chapter
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
674 and it spells out the purposes of
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
zoning which is to lessen congestion in
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
streets and to secure safety and to
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
promote health and general welfare so we
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
already have this in our books for the
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
zoning and
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
um and that's basically it thank
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
lales I
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
um will
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
Echo representative
 
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.870 align:start position:0%
Echo representative
priest's

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
priest's
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
remarks and I think that this
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
legislation although well-meaning has
 
00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:52.230 align:start position:0%
legislation although well-meaning has
far-reaching

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
far-reaching
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
consequences that are totally
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
unintended and so I will vot be voting
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
no on this
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
howand thank you um so in my real
 
00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:06.919 align:start position:0%
problem of course is Roman numeral 2 so
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
if it really is about safety then you
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't carve out your commercial zones
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
your family structures or five or more
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
units that that are Exempted from this
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
what this is really doing is it's
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
tackling duplexes and forp plexes and it
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
takes away the municipalities ability to
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
regulate it which I don't think is a
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
really good idea so I I I'll support the
 
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.110 align:start position:0%
really good idea so I I I'll support the
itl

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
yala thank you I plan on voting in
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
support of this and um I think that the
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
um consequences are intended and I wish
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
that it went further and did not carve
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
out those those uh things uh
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative Howen uh stated but going
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
one step is better than no steps so I
 
00:17:58.149 --> 00:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
will be voting in support represent
 
00:17:58.159 --> 00:17:59.470 align:start position:0%
will be voting in support represent
majority

00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I'll be um
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
voting against the ought to pass um but
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
for more technical reasons uh when we
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
had the hearing we even heard from the
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor that there were technical
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill that needed to be
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
corrected I don't see an amendment uh I
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
think those those fixes are more than
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
just uh uh ministerial or administrative
 
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
the wrong uh the wrong section of RSA is
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
cited uh language about which body is
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
responsible is is incorrect
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
um and I think those changes uh if this
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill were to go forward this is more
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
than just the other body fixing it or a
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment so for all the reasons
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
that I hear from my friends uh opposed
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh I I will be also voting against the
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
ought to pass thank you thank you

to my
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%

second I wasn't sure if I
 
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.950 align:start position:0%
second I wasn't sure if I
could

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
okay sry you may just um
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
little prompter next time
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
OTP representative Gallagher would like
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
to speak to your
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
motion yeah so
 
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
um I am moving opop pass on HB
 
00:23:59.950 --> 00:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
1362 um relative to authorizing
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities to stabilize rent
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
increases in rental housing um so this
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
is enabling legislation um as we heard
 
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
from the municipal Association
 
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.230 align:start position:0%
from the municipal Association
um

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
it just gives the municipality something
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
um an extra tool to try if they'd like
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
to um and um we've debated whether or
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
not um rent stabilization is different
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
from rent control or not I'd argue that
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
it is in fact different due to the fact
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:44.710 align:start position:0%
that um
normally

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
normally
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
um so normally bills aren't allowed in
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
the second year of a term if they were
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
the same thing as bill from the first
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
year of the term
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and since the we had a rent control
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
bill in the first year of the term and
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
then had this or now having this bill in
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
the second year of the term that to me
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
sounds like the speaker has ruled that
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah we rent rents have been going up
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
a lot lately
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
um a recent study found
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
that um half of renters Nationwide were
 
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
spending more than 30% of their income
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
on rent in
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
20122 um that's a lot
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
um and so uh one one of the objections
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
we heard was um instead of trying rent
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
control we should be or rent
 
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
stabilization we should be um doing
 
00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:06.269 align:start position:0%
stabilization we should be um doing
these

00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
other zoning reforms instead um
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
and well I I I don't think a single one
 
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.350 align:start position:0%
and well I I I don't think a single one
of

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
the witnesses saying we should do those
 
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.149 align:start position:0%
the witnesses saying we should do those
instead

00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
instead
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
satisfactory answered my question of why
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
not do both I mean the bill we just
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
heard was one of or the Bill we just
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
exec the one about zoning regulations
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
was pres one of the ones that they
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
presumably would have supported um in
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
terms of loosening zoning so um and I
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
support that one as well so um I think
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah it this this would be a bill
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
to um be in the benefit of the health
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
and safety of
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
its residence um and is exactly the sort
 
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
of kind of thing we should be passing um
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
opposing uh HB
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
1362 uh for numerous reasons um one uh I
 
00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
think if you wanted to provide more
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
affordable housing you provide
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
incentives for the developer in the
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
zoning code and that is already allowed
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
and so there are some creative ways to
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
increase affordable housing in our
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
communities um second I have SE I have
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
lived in areas where there has been rent
 
00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
stabilization uh or rent control
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it um and all
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
you see are landlords pulling out of
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
their responsibility for the upkeep of
 
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
their housing because they cannot afford
 
00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919 align:start position:0%
to make the improvements and to maintain
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
them and keep the rents below market
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
rate so I've seen this and what you get
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
is a supply of housing that are
 
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
dilapidated and and probably
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
slums so that is why I'm opposing this
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
Bill thank representative representative
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
Hicks thank you Mr chairman I also will
 
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
be opposing this bill um I think when
 
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.029 align:start position:0%
be opposing this bill um I think when
we're

00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:36.039 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
talking about this issue I think there's
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
a an understanding that landlords are
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
making a lot of money off their renters
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a landlord but I know many
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
who are and I the people I know are not
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
making a lot of money off the renters
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
they are working with them they're
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
trying to keep them in their housing um
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
so I think this is well intention but I
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a real understanding
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
understanding about renters and
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
landlords and I don't think there's a
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
real understanding about um the
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
consequences of this I think those are
 
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
either being ignored or they're not
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
being considered enough so I'll be
 
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.110 align:start position:0%
being considered enough so I'll be
opposing

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
opposing
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
Holland thank you um so I think my first
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
problem is where you're doing the
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
calculation of the allowable rent
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
increase uh that it's going to be an
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
administrative nightmare actually when
 
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
you have to go to every single landlord
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
and calculate what their billing
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
Building looks like it should be tied to
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
more of a standard which is Workforce
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
housing that takes uh 60% of area median
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
income and so you'd have a regular
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
standard that you can work for uh the
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is that uh to to uh speak to
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative priest also spoke to
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
it was the uh the incentives so right
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
now uh using RSA 79 e4c the Housing
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Zone uh we're carving out
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
30% of the the developers by is agreeing
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
with us and says yes I'll go forward
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
I'll give you 30% of that development is
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to be in in that defin thing I
 
00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
just said Workforce housing and it goes
 
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
forward I think communities have the
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
ability we are currently to work around
 
00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:14.519 align:start position:0%
with your density bonuses you use your
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
density bonus so that it makes the
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
project workable but when we do that in
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
the towns uh negotiation we're
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
negotiating how much of that project
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
actually is Workforce housing I think
 
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
that's the way to attack it not this way
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
so I I would recommend itl on this
 
00:30:30.159 --> 00:30:31.710 align:start position:0%
so I I would recommend itl on this
represent

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair I will also be
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill for all of the
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
reasons stated by my
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues um at the other end of the
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
table but also because of um the risk of
 
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
the the unintended consequences should
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
it pass I'm thinking of towns that are
 
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
adjacent to one another one passes an
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
ordinance and the other doesn't all the
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
developers flock to the one that doesn't
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
and all the developers flee the ones
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
that do and what do does that do to the
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
structures and the governance and the
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
Democratic process of those towns that
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
have passed that ordinance and have
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
suddenly seen all of their potential
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
developers leave the area to go to
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
another town that does not have this
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
ordinance I also think that it it
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
basically renders moot all of the
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
creative and inclusionary Zoning efforts
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
that have already taken place that have
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
already been mentioned 78e Workforce
 
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
housing density
 
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
bonuses um in the city of Lebanon the
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
city is buying Parcels of land
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
specifically to build Workforce housing
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
and cottage zoned areas and if this were
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
to pass and the city adopted such an
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.350 align:start position:0%
to pass and the city adopted such an
ordinance

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the impulse to do these creative
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
things would would vanish and I really
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
worry about that unintended
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
consequence thank you representative
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
further comments uh representative
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair um one of my
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill is just the uh
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
amount of administration that it will
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
take um I the number of rentable
 
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.039 align:start position:0%
properties in my town is quite numerous
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
and this is going to involve every
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
landlord proving that they uh have uh
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
reason to either raise well to raise
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
their rents to meet their needs as far
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
as the upkeep um and it says any you
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
know any governing body Etc U but you
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
know Board of selectman isn't going to
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
go through this process uh they're going
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
to have to establish a um a body to do
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
it it's going to take more than one
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
person so that's why I'm opposed to this
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
bill major thank you Mr chairman um I
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
say unfortunately I'm going to be um
 
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
opposing the ought to pass
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
I rents spikes and rents are are real
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
and and they are terribly unfortunate
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
and they they do have a a major effect
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
on lots of people in our state we need
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
to figure something out um just last
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
night the town of Northampton in a plany
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
board meeting was discussing our effort
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
we are about to engage on to reverse
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
engineer through a root cause analysis
 
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:30.519 align:start position:0%
why why is our real estate so expensive
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
and how can we make things more
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
affordable and even just scratching the
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
surface we realize that that this kind
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
of effort to stabilize rent is is so far
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
down the list of how we can make things
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
more affordable we we this is important
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
but it it will only work in the short
 
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
term and many many studies across the
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
country have proven that this will have
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
a short-term benefit like in a year but
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
long-term detrimental impacts so I
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
cannot find a reason to support the
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
legislation thank
 
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.230 align:start position:0%
legislation thank
you

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
sales I feel that this bill is a rather
 
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.510 align:start position:0%
sales I feel that this bill is a rather
pristine

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
pristine
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
example of well-meaning people trying to
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
insert the government into something
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
that should be the privy of
 
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.710 align:start position:0%
that should be the privy of
private

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
Enterprise the only way now what what we
 
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
have now in our housing crisis is that
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
we have a lot and this is not the only
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
reason but we have a lot of people
 
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
coming from other states with piles of
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
cash who are coming into New Hampshire
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
and paying whatever the market will will
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
bear which is pushing out a lot of of
 
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.430 align:start position:0%
bear which is pushing out a lot of of
our

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
longterm New Hampshire citizens
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
so this this is very well-meaning
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
but over the long period of
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
time any attempt at rent control or rent
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
stabilization has proven itself over and
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
over and
 
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative for the
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
kale um you know I I greatly appreciate
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
everybody on this committee and I we do
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
problem that we need to solve in in New
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with with our housing cost C
 
00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
that this bill just doesn't do it and I
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
think to Echo my colleague sentiments
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
there's other ways to do that there's
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
other ways to do that and one of them is
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
like bringing down energy costs and
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
things like that there's there's ways
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
that you can bring down building costs
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's ways that we can work together
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
to solve this problem so I I I will be
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
not supporting theat to pass motion on
 
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.750 align:start position:0%

power thank you Mr chair I support this
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
this bill the motion ought to pass and I
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
would also like to point out that the
 
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
the language the bolded italicized
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
language in the bill is the same exact
 
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:14.559 align:start position:0%
language that appears in
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
7223 DC the annual list as well as
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
another section of Statute 7237 Dasa
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
exemption for improvements to assist
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
persons with disabilities
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
so therefore um this bill brings this
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
particular section of Statute in line
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
two thank you representative
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
yella thank you I will be voting in
 
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to this uh bill I don't think
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
that that uh Charities need to have the
 
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.270 align:start position:0%
that that uh Charities need to have the
same

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh exception ability that disabled
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
people have and I think that that's uh
 
00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:05.079 align:start position:0%
spir like just irrelevant um trying to
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
make it uh in Conformity with that I
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
think that uh they should just follow
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
the law as it is and if they don't then
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
accept the penalties just like everyone
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
else representative Guth thank you Mr
 
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
chair my reason for
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
seconding uh the motion was mainly
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
because things
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
happen and they happen to different
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
groups of people and I think that this
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
since it says the officials
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
May uh receive the application there
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's some options there on the part
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
of the board of Selectmen so I feel
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this as I say things
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
happen and we ought to can take that
 
00:48:55.789 --> 00:48:55.799 align:start position:0%
into consideration thank you thank you
 
00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:56.870 align:start position:0%

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
I I kind of straddle the fence on this
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
one myself representative yella made
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
some uh good points and the point that
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie just made to the
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%

00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%

senses and I know it's in other places
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
in the rsas when you use the word may
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
you're opening up to potential
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
political U implications or subjective
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%

2009 I'm here today to introduce House
Bill

03:32:24.189 --> 03:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
101 to this committee because the Masons
 
03:32:28.349 --> 03:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
in New
 
03:32:30.990 --> 03:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are now in a place that the
 
03:32:34.389 --> 03:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
Grange was back in
 
03:32:37.710 --> 03:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
1983 when House Bill 67
 
03:32:42.229 --> 03:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
passed and added them to RS a 72 Co and
 
03:32:44.429 --> 03:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
23 list of
 
03:32:47.110 --> 03:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
exemptions The Grange was added to the
 
03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
exempting list because their numbers
 
03:32:48.640 --> 03:32:49.750 align:start position:0%
exempting list because their numbers
were

03:32:49.750 --> 03:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:32:53.269 --> 03:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
diminishing despite their benefit to
 
03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
society in 1983 when house bille 67
 
03:32:59.870 --> 03:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
passed New Hampshire Masons numbered
 
03:32:59.880 --> 03:33:01.750 align:start position:0%
passed New Hampshire Masons numbered
over

03:33:01.750 --> 03:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:33:04.710 --> 03:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
13,000 unfortunately 40 years later
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
we're just over
 
03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
3700 right now and our numbers on
 
03:33:13.630 --> 03:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
fortunately decline
 
03:33:15.790 --> 03:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
annually by adding the grains through
 
03:33:18.269 --> 03:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
the exemption list 40 years ago we save
 
03:33:20.429 --> 03:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
the organization from probably
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
ruination and I'm hopeful we can do the
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
same thing for Granite State
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
Masons uh this bill exempts lodges in
 
03:33:32.429 --> 03:33:32.439 align:start position:0%
towns that have them and I think there's
 
03:33:35.950 --> 03:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
around 55 56 towns that have them right
 
03:33:42.510 --> 03:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
now and uh just U my logic in
 
03:33:46.870 --> 03:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
Candia we uh old annual fundraisers for
 
03:33:50.189 --> 03:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
the food pantry we allow the building to
 
03:33:54.269 --> 03:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
be used for Scouts Town committees
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and much more we allow this
 
03:34:00.750 --> 03:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
free of charge because up until this
 
03:34:05.070 --> 03:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
year we were not charged a uh property
 
03:34:08.110 --> 03:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
tax and so we were able to return all
 
03:34:12.030 --> 03:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
our stuff all that to the town Plus
 
03:34:12.040 --> 03:34:13.670 align:start position:0%
our stuff all that to the town Plus
money

03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:34:16.030 --> 03:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh over the last few years
 
03:34:19.030 --> 03:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
several lodges have had
 
03:34:22.670 --> 03:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
to literally close or combine with
 
03:34:22.680 --> 03:34:24.429 align:start position:0%
to literally close or combine with
another

03:34:24.429 --> 03:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:34:28.670 --> 03:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
Lodge and um I just want to put a side
 
03:34:33.229 --> 03:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
note in here that um I've also been a
 
03:34:35.349 --> 03:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
member of the legendary liance club for
 
03:34:35.359 --> 03:34:36.510 align:start position:0%
member of the legendary liance club for
30

03:34:36.510 --> 03:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
30
 
03:34:39.910 --> 03:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
years and um we were one of the few
 
03:34:39.920 --> 03:34:41.750 align:start position:0%
years and um we were one of the few
places

03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
places
 
03:34:44.110 --> 03:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
Lions Clubs in the state that had our
 
03:34:44.120 --> 03:34:44.870 align:start position:0%
Lions Clubs in the state that had our
own

03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
own
 
03:34:47.110 --> 03:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
building and unfortunately we had to
 
03:34:50.189 --> 03:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
give that building up because it was a
 
03:34:52.189 --> 03:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
200 year old building and we couldn't
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
afford to do our fundraising and return
 
03:34:59.070 --> 03:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
money to the town like we wanted to and
 
03:35:02.229 --> 03:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh keep the building up at the same
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
time and I want to make it perfectly
 
03:35:06.910 --> 03:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
clear here
 
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a small group of lodges in
 
03:35:13.070 --> 03:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
the state that actually have some
 
03:35:14.830 --> 03:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
property rentals where they rent out to
 
03:35:17.790 --> 03:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
certain businesses they would not be
 
03:35:20.510 --> 03:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
exempt under this they would still have
 
03:35:23.229 --> 03:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
to continue to
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:30.110 --> 03:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh I think I'll end it at that
 
03:35:30.120 --> 03:35:33.110 align:start position:0%
uh I think I'll end it at that
point

03:35:33.110 --> 03:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:35:37.030 --> 03:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
um I did talked to people from the
 
03:35:37.040 --> 03:35:38.269 align:start position:0%
um I did talked to people from the
municipal

03:35:38.269 --> 03:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
03:35:41.429 --> 03:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
Association a while back and they asked
 
03:35:44.429 --> 03:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
if we could possibly include something
 
03:35:46.910 --> 03:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
that might take a look at the whole
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
thing about exemptions for different
 
03:35:53.189 --> 03:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
properties and Mr chairman I would maybe
 
03:35:56.429 --> 03:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
suggest that if you without having to
 
03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
put it into legislation and make another
 
03:36:00.429 --> 03:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
commission which you know I
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
hate uh uh maybe you could have a
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of this committee you know
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
formed to take a look at that at some
 
03:36:11.229 --> 03:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
point you know moving forward
 
03:36:14.110 --> 03:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
and come back and uh you know give us an
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:22.550 --> 03:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
find and uh also I'd like to point out
 
03:36:25.429 --> 03:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
that this is a bipartisan piece of
 
03:36:28.550 --> 03:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh I want to thank the
 
03:36:31.550 --> 03:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
Democratic leader who is not Amon but
 
03:36:33.790 --> 03:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
comes from Manchester and knows the
 
03:36:36.790 --> 03:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
benefit that that Lodge gives the uh
 
03:36:40.349 --> 03:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester my old Hometown and
 
03:36:42.510 --> 03:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
with with that I will try and take any
 
03:36:45.750 --> 03:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions but we have uh a number of uh
 
03:36:48.630 --> 03:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
people here that are the Grand Master
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
and stuff that will probably do a much
 
03:36:52.670 --> 03:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
better job of uh telling you where we're
 
03:36:54.710 --> 03:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
at right now than than I could probably
 
03:36:58.710 --> 03:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
do it thank you Mr Speaker um what I
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
will suggest is the speaker's itinerary
 
03:37:04.750 --> 03:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
I'm certain is probably pretty busy um
 
03:37:07.150 --> 03:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
if we can hold questions for other
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
presenters that might be um better but
 
03:37:11.469 --> 03:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
uh represent savis if you have one go
 
03:37:13.510 --> 03:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:37:17.030 --> 03:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr Speaker um how
 
03:37:19.750 --> 03:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
would the Masonic lodges that do rent
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
out their properties know that they were
 
03:37:25.349 --> 03:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
not exempt under this legisl how would
 
03:37:28.269 --> 03:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
they know well I I I think the I think
 
03:37:30.510 --> 03:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
there's five or six that do rent out
 
03:37:33.070 --> 03:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
properties and obviously they'd be
 
03:37:35.110 --> 03:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
informed that they didn't qualify for
 
03:37:35.120 --> 03:37:37.269 align:start position:0%
informed that they didn't qualify for
the

03:37:37.269 --> 03:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:37:39.910 --> 03:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
exemption I know nashwa I think nashwa
 
03:37:42.150 --> 03:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
is one of the towns that has some rental
 
03:37:44.349 --> 03:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
property and there's a couple others but
 
03:37:46.189 --> 03:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh there's only about half a dozen of
 
03:37:47.950 --> 03:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
them that actually I think and I could
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
be corrected by the grandm but there's
 
03:37:52.150 --> 03:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
only I think about six of them that
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
actually have some rental property they
 
03:37:55.950 --> 03:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
own a building and rent part of it out
 
03:37:55.960 --> 03:37:57.110 align:start position:0%
own a building and rent part of it out
for

03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:37:59.389 --> 03:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
something but obviously they would
 
03:38:03.349 --> 03:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:07.030 --> 03:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
qualify further questions for the
 
03:38:09.670 --> 03:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you m speaker
 
03:38:12.510 --> 03:38:12.520 align:start position:0%

Wier Rockingham 14 Kingston and East
 
03:38:36.389 --> 03:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
Kingston as a co-sponsor of hb1001 I
 
03:38:38.110 --> 03:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
would like to give you some reasons to
 
03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
support this bill as you would expect
 
03:38:43.189 --> 03:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
ECT I am a Mason and have been for 39
 
03:38:45.510 --> 03:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
years I take it to heart that one of our
 
03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
claims is that we make good men better
 
03:38:51.030 --> 03:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
we have as an association a long history
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
we were derived from the guilds that
 
03:38:54.590 --> 03:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
constructed the European Cathedrals that
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
were built hundreds of years ago and are
 
03:38:59.830 --> 03:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
still standing The Guild had a few steps
 
03:39:01.510 --> 03:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
that a member would progress through
 
03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
Entered Apprentice fellowcraft then
 
03:39:06.110 --> 03:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
Master Mason we've copied that
 
03:39:07.830 --> 03:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
progression in the similar lessons one
 
03:39:10.309 --> 03:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
must learn to progress we're careful who
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
we choose to enter the fraternity and
 
03:39:13.950 --> 03:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
many of the members are involved in each
 
03:39:16.910 --> 03:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
person's progress being good citizen one
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
of our requirements thus we are involved
 
03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
in our communities our buildings are
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
frequently used by youth groups as well
 
03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
as other community organizations our
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
parking lots are open to our neighbors
 
03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
and others when we are not meeting the
 
03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
Masons also created and sponsored other
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
groups for young women rainbow girls for
 
03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
young men dlay for couples Eastern Star
 
03:39:41.189 --> 03:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
and the Grange when these groups
 
03:39:42.630 --> 03:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
obtained their buildings the Masons
 
03:39:44.349 --> 03:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
worked to get those buildings property
 
03:39:46.950 --> 03:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
tax exemptions and you will find those
 
03:39:49.469 --> 03:39:49.479 align:start position:0%
exemptions already in law but being good
 
03:39:51.309 --> 03:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
citizens I am sure that the Masons would
 
03:39:53.309 --> 03:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
have said we're proud to pay our share
 
03:39:55.550 --> 03:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
to support our community that was a
 
03:39:58.349 --> 03:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
different time we had far more members
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
and property taxes were much lower than
 
03:40:03.070 --> 03:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
today many of our lodges are over 100
 
03:40:05.110 --> 03:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
years old and the maintenance costs
 
03:40:07.269 --> 03:40:07.279 align:start position:0%
likely up likely to use up most of the
 
03:40:09.469 --> 03:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
dues we pay we still maintain the
 
03:40:11.189 --> 03:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
charitable giving that The Lodges always
 
03:40:13.550 --> 03:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
supported such as local food pantries
 
03:40:16.150 --> 03:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
youth organizations members relief or
 
03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
members relief scholarships veterans
 
03:40:20.750 --> 03:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
organizations and others in the last
 
03:40:22.630 --> 03:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
five years the Masons collectively
 
03:40:22.640 --> 03:40:24.670 align:start position:0%
five years the Masons collectively
contributed

03:40:24.670 --> 03:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
contributed
 
03:40:27.630 --> 03:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
$500,000 to their local communities I
 
03:40:29.710 --> 03:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
was successful in my town of Kingston in
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
gaining tax exemption at town meeting in
 
03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
1992 some other lodges have as well but
 
03:40:39.150 --> 03:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
we have heard many unsuccessful attempts
 
03:40:40.950 --> 03:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
since we're all non profit charitable
 
03:40:42.670 --> 03:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
organizations we think this tax
 
03:40:45.150 --> 03:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
exemption should be Statewide as those
 
03:40:46.750 --> 03:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
groups Rec created that I earlier
 
03:40:49.389 --> 03:40:49.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned are as Veterans as our
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
veterans organizations we more than make
 
03:40:53.670 --> 03:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
up for any burden that we may impose on
 
03:40:55.670 --> 03:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
the communities where we live and we
 
03:40:57.429 --> 03:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
believe that we are improving some of
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
that community's members thank you I'd
 
03:41:02.590 --> 03:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:41:10.429 --> 03:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so I'm just noticing in in
 
03:41:14.349 --> 03:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
the bill textt so um in the first
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
section it lists um every religious
 
03:41:21.030 --> 03:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
educational and charitable
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
organization um or Grange um and before
 
03:41:27.910 --> 03:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
listing Masonic l or Masonic Association
 
03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
so why would why aren't the Masons
 
03:41:34.510 --> 03:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
already considered as fitting under one
 
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
of those existing
 
03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
categories as I said I believe that you
 
03:41:42.590 --> 03:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
know as part of ever um wish to be
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
better citizens and support of our
 
03:41:46.590 --> 03:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
community probably the Mason said you
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
know please help these other groups that
 
03:41:51.229 --> 03:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
are struggling but we are willing to pay
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
our taxes to support the community as
 
03:41:55.790 --> 03:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
part of being good citizens however as
 
03:41:58.110 --> 03:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
was mentioned we had far more members
 
03:42:01.469 --> 03:42:01.479 align:start position:0%
than when that was likely said and we
 
03:42:04.269 --> 03:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
also did not have the the heavy property
 
03:42:06.590 --> 03:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
tax burden the property tax burdens have
 
03:42:09.309 --> 03:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
have accelerated far ahead of inflation
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
so that the
 
03:42:12.590 --> 03:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
much less affordable now as we all know
 
03:42:19.030 --> 03:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
ago representative
 
03:42:25.870 --> 03:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
lales yes thanks for taking my question
 
03:42:29.630 --> 03:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
um can anybody join the
 
03:42:32.110 --> 03:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
Masons no we go through a selective
 
03:42:35.309 --> 03:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
process and and you should get a few
 
03:42:40.269 --> 03:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
Masons to sign your your uh application
 
03:42:42.910 --> 03:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't we look at people to see
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
they're standing in the community what
 
03:42:46.590 --> 03:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
their background is what they've done in
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
their lives and and not everyone is
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
accepted we also do a background
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
investigation followup Mr chairman
 
03:42:58.830 --> 03:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
follow up I I happen to be a student of
 
03:43:01.630 --> 03:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
history and I know that the Masons have
 
03:43:04.950 --> 03:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
a long history in this country and there
 
03:43:08.149 --> 03:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
were times in the history of the United
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
States where Catholics were prohibited
 
03:43:13.389 --> 03:43:13.399 align:start position:0%
from joining the
 
03:43:16.750 --> 03:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
Masons um I know that we have various
 
03:43:19.990 --> 03:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that discriminate based
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
upon uh race gender and so forth I'm
 
03:43:27.189 --> 03:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
just I I really don't know much about
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
the Masons but if you could enlighten me
 
03:43:35.710 --> 03:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
about uh the openness of membership the
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
only reason I'm saying this is I'm
 
03:43:42.910 --> 03:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
struggling in my mind as to why anybody
 
03:43:45.910 --> 03:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
would object to what you're asking for
 
03:43:48.030 --> 03:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm just trying to see if
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
there's anything that we can get out
 
03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
ahead of it well as I said
 
03:43:58.510 --> 03:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
the the ethos has evolved over the
 
03:44:01.590 --> 03:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
decades we have Catholic Masons we have
 
03:44:04.149 --> 03:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
we have black Masons we have Hispanics
 
03:44:06.670 --> 03:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
and so on and at one time one of my
 
03:44:09.510 --> 03:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
friends that was in both the Knights of
 
03:44:12.349 --> 03:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
columb and the Mason said at one time
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
because the Mason said you must keep the
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
secrets that we give you that the
 
03:44:19.590 --> 03:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
Catholics felt they couldn't join
 
03:44:21.309 --> 03:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't keep secrets from
 
03:44:23.550 --> 03:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
their priest but that was kind of a
 
03:44:26.349 --> 03:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
self-imposed thing but and that was one
 
03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
told to me by a Catholic which I'm not
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
but that was one of the things that
 
03:44:32.630 --> 03:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
supposedly kept them out at the time
 
03:44:34.510 --> 03:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
because oh you can't have secrets away
 
03:44:36.429 --> 03:44:36.439 align:start position:0%
from your priest that was what they
 
03:44:38.030 --> 03:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
believed and that was what some of them
 
03:44:40.990 --> 03:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
chose to believe thank you
 
03:44:43.349 --> 03:44:43.359 align:start position:0%

C4 there's a specific one for Mason 501
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%

chairman followup and are you um do you
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%

have thank you very much thank
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Gilman thank you Mr
 
03:45:30.510 --> 03:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
03:45:34.590 --> 03:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I I am not going
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
to uh uh take an action here but I
 
03:45:41.229 --> 03:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
wanted your opinion um
 
03:45:44.710 --> 03:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
here we're discussing Masonic lodges and
 
03:45:47.670 --> 03:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
associations becoming tax exempt but
 
03:45:51.469 --> 03:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
there are uh other frat fraternal
 
03:45:54.189 --> 03:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
organizations and not I don't know the
 
03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
word for women but like the Daughters of
 
03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
the American Revolution they don't
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily own property but I know the
 
03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
Odd Fellow do and they're still active
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
so my opinion is should we get somebody
 
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
in this committee perhaps who is a uh
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
Mason or from another fraternal would
 
03:46:16.670 --> 03:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
you object to that change of not taking
 
03:46:19.269 --> 03:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
the Masons out and just making it a
 
03:46:22.269 --> 03:46:22.279 align:start position:0%
fraternal orders I would not
 
03:46:25.110 --> 03:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
object I'll work on
 
03:46:29.429 --> 03:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
you representative Brown representative
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
Elwood could you turn your mic off
 
03:46:36.189 --> 03:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
please thank you repres Brian thank you
 
03:46:40.389 --> 03:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker um as a co-sponsor um I guess
 
03:46:42.189 --> 03:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
my question is do you feel the reason
 
03:46:44.349 --> 03:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
why you need this bill is primarily
 
03:46:46.269 --> 03:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
because of the historical precedent that
 
03:46:48.429 --> 03:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
you folks put on yourselves by not
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
taking the exemption early
 
03:46:55.030 --> 03:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.040 --> 03:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative stavis did you still have
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
a question I do
 
03:47:06.149 --> 03:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
um Freemasons are specifically mentioned
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
03:47:13.510 --> 03:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
2921 the volunt associations act um and
 
03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
all organizations in that act are exempt
 
03:47:18.110 --> 03:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
from federal
 
03:47:20.990 --> 03:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
taxes as it says in the
 
03:47:24.309 --> 03:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
RSA is it true that if you're exe an
 
03:47:26.429 --> 03:47:26.439 align:start position:0%
organization exempt from federal taxes
 
03:47:28.590 --> 03:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
that does not necessarily exempt you
 
03:47:32.429 --> 03:47:32.439 align:start position:0%
from state taxes I'm I'm just asking yes
 
03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
case represent of
 
03:47:38.520 --> 03:47:40.790 align:start position:0%
case represent of
power

03:47:40.790 --> 03:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
power
 
03:47:42.070 --> 03:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:47:44.630 --> 03:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you please
 
03:47:47.910 --> 03:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
explain um in lines three and four it
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
states Masonic Lodge or Masonic
 
03:47:53.710 --> 03:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
Association what is the distinction
 
03:47:56.070 --> 03:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
between the two and what exactly are
 
03:47:58.189 --> 03:47:58.199 align:start position:0%
each how are they different thank you it
 
03:48:00.070 --> 03:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
is is just a choice that the
 
03:48:02.990 --> 03:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
organization chooses our constitution
 
03:48:04.830 --> 03:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
says you should have a Building
 
03:48:07.990 --> 03:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
Association apart from the Masonic
 
03:48:10.030 --> 03:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
Association for a brief period
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
my my Lodge did not have a build
 
03:48:15.030 --> 03:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
Building Association because we we sold
 
03:48:16.710 --> 03:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
the building then we bought it back and
 
03:48:18.349 --> 03:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
when we bought it back we didn't form a
 
03:48:20.830 --> 03:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
Building Association so we were just the
 
03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
Masonic Lodge so it was it's still the
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
same building in various times it has
 
03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
different way of incorporating and
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes I believe the encouragement
 
03:48:34.750 --> 03:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
from the Grand Lodge is that you should
 
03:48:36.870 --> 03:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
have a Building Association but there
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
are a few that do
 
03:48:38.399 --> 03:48:41.910 align:start position:0%
are a few that do
not

03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative uh kill thank you Mr
 
03:48:45.950 --> 03:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank thank you representative for
 
03:48:49.149 --> 03:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you guys stated
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
there was 55 to 56 towns um or buildings
 
03:48:54.870 --> 03:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
um do we do we have an idea of how much
 
03:48:58.030 --> 03:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
tax revenue that that that currently is
 
03:48:59.229 --> 03:48:59.239 align:start position:0%
for those
 
03:49:02.550 --> 03:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
properties well one I remember that I
 
03:49:04.670 --> 03:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
was once in a position where I went
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
around and visited The Lodges within my
 
03:49:10.510 --> 03:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
district was uh Portsmouth has a very
 
03:49:13.269 --> 03:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
big building and it has two lodges that
 
03:49:15.630 --> 03:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
meet there and they have a big parking
 
03:49:20.830 --> 03:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
lot and at one point the um the city
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
made a deal with them we'll pay you
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
$20,000 to use your parking lot part of
 
03:49:28.870 --> 03:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
the time when you're not needing it I
 
03:49:30.389 --> 03:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
said that sounds good what are you
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
paying taxes the taxes were up to
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
40,000 and you know my taxes in Kingston
 
03:49:38.910 --> 03:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
would probably likely be around 8 or
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
9,000 ,000 did did we not have an
 
03:49:42.910 --> 03:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
exemption that's almost what we pay
 
03:49:47.790 --> 03:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
every year and for all our needs so um
 
03:49:50.670 --> 03:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
and and some of the some of the U lodges
 
03:49:52.830 --> 03:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
that have a part of the building rented
 
03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:54.070 align:start position:0%
that have a part of the building rented
out

03:49:54.070 --> 03:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:49:56.469 --> 03:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
full-time uh have a deal with some of
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
the cities of towns that they are exempt
 
03:50:01.349 --> 03:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
in the portion of the building that is
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
just strictly used by the Masons but pay
 
03:50:06.229 --> 03:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
taxes on the part that is rented out so
 
03:50:08.510 --> 03:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's there there's different
 
03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
things in different towns but the taxes
 
03:50:14.149 --> 03:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
are depends on where you are and later
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
on I went to uh have a meeting with the
 
03:50:20.870 --> 03:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
one in Hampton and Hampton was on a road
 
03:50:24.070 --> 03:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
that had been a dead end and they said
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
the town wants to cut across our
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
property to get to the the end of that
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
Dead End Road and make it available to
 
03:50:33.550 --> 03:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
get to their town yard where they keep
 
03:50:36.590 --> 03:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
some things and they want to know how
 
03:50:40.269 --> 03:50:40.279 align:start position:0%
much we want to to use that right away
 
03:50:41.950 --> 03:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
and I said don't make the mistake
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth made at one point Portsmouth
 
03:50:47.189 --> 03:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
probably could have said we'll let you
 
03:50:50.990 --> 03:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
use the parking lot in exchange for the
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
property taxes so that's what Hampton
 
03:50:56.670 --> 03:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
did at my advice will let you use the
 
03:51:00.429 --> 03:51:00.439 align:start position:0%
right away for property exemption so the
 
03:51:01.950 --> 03:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
two things equal probably when they
 
03:51:04.830 --> 03:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
first started out with uh renting out
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
the parking lot in in Portsmouth it was
 
03:51:09.630 --> 03:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
about equal to what they paid INX taxes
 
03:51:11.670 --> 03:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
but the taxes go up and the rental
 
03:51:14.229 --> 03:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't so there's various things we can
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
do but that has to be one of the things
 
03:51:18.149 --> 03:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
you have to take care and in doing so
 
03:51:20.670 --> 03:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
you kind of come out
 
03:51:22.590 --> 03:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
even further questions for
 
03:51:22.600 --> 03:51:24.229 align:start position:0%
even further questions for

state Freemasonry is an organization

that has been around for hundreds of
 
03:53:23.870 --> 03:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
years and while it has evolved over time
 
03:53:27.149 --> 03:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
its primary teachings of Brotherly Love
 
03:53:30.590 --> 03:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
relief and Truth have remained
 
03:53:33.389 --> 03:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
constant as Freemasons we are taught
 
03:53:36.070 --> 03:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
that by the exercise of Brotherly Love
 
03:53:38.950 --> 03:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
we are all part of one family that
 
03:53:41.149 --> 03:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
belief of the distressed is a duty
 
03:53:44.910 --> 03:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon all and that truth is the
 
03:53:47.550 --> 03:53:47.560 align:start position:0%
foundation of every
 
03:53:50.590 --> 03:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
virtue these virtues are encompassed in
 
03:53:53.389 --> 03:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
our Declaration of masonic principles
 
03:53:55.950 --> 03:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
which were developed hundreds of years
 
03:53:58.189 --> 03:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
ago the Grand Lodge of New Hampshire was
 
03:53:59.590 --> 03:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
founded in
 
03:54:02.110 --> 03:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
1789 these principles date back to the
 
03:54:02.120 --> 03:54:03.229 align:start position:0%
1789 these principles date back to the
early

03:54:03.229 --> 03:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
early
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
1800s and the verbiage that is going to
 
03:54:09.389 --> 03:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
follow is certainly vocabul that we
 
03:54:13.030 --> 03:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily use in today's
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%

sincere hope is that I have been able to
 
03:59:41.550 --> 03:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
shed some light on who the Masons of New
 
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are and the contributions we
 
03:59:44.830 --> 03:59:44.840 align:start position:0%

03:59:49.830 --> 03:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for Testimony do I
 
03:59:53.229 --> 03:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
see any questions representative
 
03:59:55.349 --> 03:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:59:58.510 --> 03:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you so I
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
understand that um a previous speaker
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
said that the um Masonic lodges and
 
04:00:06.120 --> 04:00:07.349 align:start position:0%
said that the um Masonic lodges and
Masonic

04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
Masonic
 
04:00:12.269 --> 04:00:12.279 align:start position:0%
associations they are um they fall under
 
04:00:12.279 --> 04:00:14.469 align:start position:0%
associations they are um they fall under
the

04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:18.309 --> 04:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
501c I think he said 10 yeah because
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
they operate under a lodge system cor
 
04:00:27.309 --> 04:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
whereas Section 8 is just a fraternal
 
04:00:31.830 --> 04:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
organization so my understanding is um
 
04:00:34.229 --> 04:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
domestic fernal societies fall under the
 
04:00:37.630 --> 04:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
501 C10 section of the Internal Revenue
 
04:00:40.590 --> 04:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
code the building associations that we
 
04:00:43.950 --> 04:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
referenced fall under Section 501
 
04:00:46.429 --> 04:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
C2 and those associations are
 
04:00:49.510 --> 04:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
specifically designed basically as title
 
04:00:52.870 --> 04:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
holding companies to hold buildings for
 
04:00:54.790 --> 04:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
the rent of other nonprofit
 
04:00:58.149 --> 04:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
organizations within the 501
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
section so that was just my lead in okay
 
04:01:04.110 --> 04:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
but my question is I'm trying to I
 
04:01:06.030 --> 04:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to establish that but because
 
04:01:07.710 --> 04:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
there's another piece to this it's it's
 
04:01:10.710 --> 04:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and charitable organization so
 
04:01:13.030 --> 04:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand that under the
 
04:01:16.510 --> 04:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
IRS code charitable organization comes
 
04:01:16.520 --> 04:01:17.870 align:start position:0%
IRS code charitable organization comes
under

04:01:17.870 --> 04:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:01:22.590 --> 04:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
501c3 correct so is can we are all
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
Masonic lodges and build Masonic
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
building associations they also
 
04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
organized under that
 
04:01:33.469 --> 04:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
501c3 to make them charitable
 
04:01:36.110 --> 04:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
organizations how do we know what's a
 
04:01:38.429 --> 04:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
charitable organization in the state of
 
04:01:42.189 --> 04:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so domestic fraternal
 
04:01:43.790 --> 04:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
societies like the Masons and other
 
04:01:46.750 --> 04:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
fraternal organizations under that IRS
 
04:01:51.830 --> 04:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
statute are specifically 501 C10 501c3
 
04:01:54.389 --> 04:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
organizations are those normal Charities
 
04:01:56.429 --> 04:01:56.439 align:start position:0%
that when you contribute to you were
 
04:01:59.389 --> 04:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
able to deduct those contributions on
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
your income tax return and only 501c3
 
04:02:04.630 --> 04:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
Charities but there are many other
 
04:02:07.030 --> 04:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations within that 501
 
04:02:09.870 --> 04:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
section and Masons fall under the 501
 
04:02:13.189 --> 04:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
C10 specifically but as I noted in my
 
04:02:15.149 --> 04:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
Declaration of masonic principles we are
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
charitable in that we do give back to
 
04:02:17.279 --> 04:02:19.189 align:start position:0%
charitable in that we do give back to
our

04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:02:23.510 --> 04:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:27.510 --> 04:02:27.520 align:start position:0%

04:02:39.149 --> 04:02:39.159 align:start position:0%
specifically Shriner
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
uh Scottish rights and perhaps there are
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
other subgroups my question is it your
 
04:02:49.710 --> 04:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:52.710 --> 04:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
hb1001 that these
 
04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
subgroups and the ones that you
 
04:02:57.790 --> 04:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned and perhaps other ones also be
 
04:03:01.469 --> 04:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
included as exempt all of those other
 
04:03:03.510 --> 04:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
additional Masonic members of our family
 
04:03:05.309 --> 04:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
meet in the buildings and the Masonic
 
04:03:06.870 --> 04:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
lodges that are covered under the
 
04:03:09.750 --> 04:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
proposed statute
 
04:03:13.110 --> 04:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
so so followup followup go ahead so
 
04:03:17.389 --> 04:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
those subgroups do not own real property
 
04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh some may but again if they do own
 
04:03:23.189 --> 04:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
property that is is rented out to
 
04:03:25.309 --> 04:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
commercial space then they would be not
 
04:03:26.670 --> 04:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
they would not be subject to this
 
04:03:26.680 --> 04:03:29.269 align:start position:0%

04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
19 where it states if such property is
 
04:03:47.469 --> 04:03:47.479 align:start position:0%
rented for business purposes the real
 
04:03:51.670 --> 04:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:53.870 --> 04:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
exempt correct me if I'm wrong were you
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
talking about a parking lot that is
 
04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes used by a for a commercial
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
reason for
 
04:04:04.389 --> 04:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
example would be a business
 
04:04:06.429 --> 04:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
purpose you know that that's a very
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
interesting question I mean that that
 
04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
particular portion of that statute was
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
already within there um we my
 
04:04:15.469 --> 04:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the Masonic lodges
 
04:04:18.510 --> 04:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
and associations were added up above uh
 
04:04:20.189 --> 04:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
so my understanding of that particular
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
provision is that if there's any
 
04:04:25.309 --> 04:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
commercial rental space that is provided
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
by these buildings or within these
 
04:04:29.790 --> 04:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
buildings that they would not be exempt
 
04:04:32.550 --> 04:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
under this particular
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
provision and representative wer I
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
believe did indicate that there are
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
probably five or six
 
04:04:39.910 --> 04:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
Masonic lodges that would fall
 
04:04:41.590 --> 04:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
specifically under that statute and they
 
04:04:43.229 --> 04:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
are aware that they would not follow
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
under that
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
statute go ahead thank you so if the
 
04:04:52.030 --> 04:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
property is rented out part-time for
 
04:04:52.040 --> 04:04:54.030 align:start position:0%
property is rented out part-time for
business

04:04:54.030 --> 04:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
calculated it's a good question I'm not
 
04:05:03.189 --> 04:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
sure I have the ability to answer that
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
question based upon how the statute is
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you you
 
04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have two very
 
04:05:13.950 --> 04:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
quick ones um on your last page of your
 
04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
testimony You'
 
04:05:17.990 --> 04:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned relationships have included
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
abatements from property
 
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
taxes uh so I'm assuming in the past
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh you've been able to get reductions or
 
04:05:29.710 --> 04:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
elimination of property taxes and then
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
the next line it says unfortunately
 
04:05:34.590 --> 04:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
recent decisions implementing payment of
 
04:05:36.670 --> 04:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
full property tax could you explain what
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
those recent decisions
 
04:05:40.269 --> 04:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I again I can give you a personal
 
04:05:42.269 --> 04:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
experience I belong to the Masonic Lodge
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
located in
 
04:05:46.229 --> 04:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
gwn and for a number of years we were
 
04:05:49.950 --> 04:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
getting a partial abatement for our
 
04:05:52.510 --> 04:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
facility um we were essentially as
 
04:05:55.110 --> 04:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder indicated paying
 
04:05:57.670 --> 04:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
only on the the Masonic Lodge portion
 
04:06:00.550 --> 04:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
the dining hall portion um was we were
 
04:06:03.070 --> 04:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
actually paying property taxes on our
 
04:06:06.269 --> 04:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
recent uh most recent bill for the 2023
 
04:06:09.070 --> 04:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
property tax year uh that exemption was
 
04:06:12.349 --> 04:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
denied based upon interpretation of the
 
04:06:15.750 --> 04:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
current statute and what's been
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
transpiring thank you further questions
 
04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
04:06:21.630 --> 04:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you I appreciate the
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
milbrand good afternoon my name is
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
Donald milbrand I live in Bristol New
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am a Mason but I wanted to
 
04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
give a brief testimony to the committee
 
04:06:47.030 --> 04:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for listening to me uh
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
from my experience of 12 Years on the
 
04:06:54.110 --> 04:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
Bristol select board Bristol has a very
 
04:06:55.870 --> 04:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
good relationship with their local
 
04:07:00.910 --> 04:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
Masonic Lodge uh annually we have to do
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
a uh a motion to Abate the taxes for the
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
Masonic lodge and we do that every year
 
04:07:12.269 --> 04:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
um we also have a good relationship with
 
04:07:14.070 --> 04:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
the lodge and that we have a me
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
memorandum understanding for use of the
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
parking lot as public parking and they
 
04:07:21.469 --> 04:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
take care of some of the maintenance for
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
it uh I'm in support of this bill mainly
 
04:07:27.269 --> 04:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
to make it easier and more consistent on
 
04:07:30.870 --> 04:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
the towns so that uh I believe it was
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned for a parking they should have
 
04:07:36.269 --> 04:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
that Portsmith should have negotiated to
 
04:07:38.469 --> 04:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
have the taxes Abad that's not
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
permissible from my understanding of
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal law it the select board has to
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
every year move to Abate taxes so you
 
04:07:53.109 --> 04:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
can't have a a memorandum including that
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
so Bristol has been fortunate in having
 
04:07:58.189 --> 04:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
good town administrators that remember
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
it every year and it's also had good
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
select boards that understand the
 
04:08:06.429 --> 04:08:06.439 align:start position:0%
significance of the contribution of the
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
Masonic Lodge and as I start to say I'm
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill just to make it
 
04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
more consistent um and easier both on
 
04:08:18.309 --> 04:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
The Lodges and on the select boards so
 
04:08:21.030 --> 04:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a year-to year do we evate them
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
or not thank you very
 
04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there any questions
 
04:08:28.870 --> 04:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have just one quick one
 
04:08:31.870 --> 04:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:34.429 --> 04:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
selectman is is it your testimony am I
 
04:08:36.990 --> 04:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
hearing it correctly that currently
 
04:08:40.030 --> 04:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
towns or municipalities have the ability
 
04:08:40.040 --> 04:08:40.950 align:start position:0%
towns or municipalities have the ability
to

04:08:40.950 --> 04:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:08:44.109 --> 04:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
actually uh I understand it would make
 
04:08:46.950 --> 04:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
it easier but towns have the ability now
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
to issue abatements on Masonic lodges
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
and association yes all right thank you
 
04:08:55.269 --> 04:08:55.279 align:start position:0%

Roberts Jr I live in the town of

gilmington I'm for disclosure I was a
 
04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
master of a lodge in Alon W Baki I'm
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
also an active member in Mount Lebanon U

organizations um um Shriners um other
 
04:09:56.990 --> 04:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that I've helped organize
 
04:10:00.189 --> 04:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
all Masonic
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
groups I think probably you're asking
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
yourself why are we here if what the
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
gentleman said
 
04:10:10.830 --> 04:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
four is correct
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide that the Selectmen have the
 
04:10:16.189 --> 04:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
Abate so I'll give you one example why I
 
04:10:20.309 --> 04:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
think we're
 
04:10:24.429 --> 04:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
here is a city of lonia hired in aaisa
 
04:10:25.830 --> 04:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
because of its
 
04:10:29.349 --> 04:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
size the appraisal came back
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the lodge in all cases had sent
 
04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
previously a document which they
 
04:10:43.269 --> 04:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
also reported to the chal trust division
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Justice
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
annually as a nonprofit
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
charity is adopted as an
 
04:10:55.149 --> 04:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
organization and the organization owns
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
the building where the blue Lodge or the
 
04:11:01.309 --> 04:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
lodge itself actually meets
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
upstairs and the basement is used for
 
04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
multiple purposes including municipal
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
organiz a nonprofit
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
Etc so we got this notice that you now
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
have to pay this tax after we did all
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
that and they gave us two reasons one
 
04:11:22.550 --> 04:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
which we found out was a clerical error
 
04:11:26.349 --> 04:11:26.359 align:start position:0%
they misfiled our annual report going to
 
04:11:30.510 --> 04:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
the the town or the city and the other
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:37.950 --> 04:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
charity now I had understood like some
 
04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
of the people here perhaps have
 
04:11:42.670 --> 04:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
understood or and many Masons had
 
04:11:45.349 --> 04:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
understood that the municipality can
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
make the decision and in fact some
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
towns the municipality does make the
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
decision sometimes it's 100% sometimes
 
04:12:00.389 --> 04:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
it's some portion if it has a a lease to
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
another profit
 
04:12:05.109 --> 04:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
organization that is taxed such as the
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
building that's multi- stored uh
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
wherever the lodge mates wouldn't be
 
04:12:13.109 --> 04:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
taxed but the retail businesses down
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
below would be taxed on the same bases
 
04:12:19.870 --> 04:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
is any other business in that town but
 
04:12:21.990 --> 04:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the
 
04:12:24.830 --> 04:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
line and I can find it in the statute
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I've done some
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
research that ability that we thought
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
selectman in city councils had to
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
immediately or originally Abate the the
 
04:12:37.680 --> 04:12:40.269 align:start position:0%
immediately or originally Abate the the
taxes

04:12:40.269 --> 04:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:12:43.149 --> 04:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
evaporated and it evaporated when the
 
04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
town of or the city of
 
04:12:49.790 --> 04:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
lonia after more than 50 years and Lodge
 
04:12:52.269 --> 04:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
has been there over 200 years but at
 
04:12:55.550 --> 04:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
least after 50 years
 
04:12:58.750 --> 04:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
decided that they owed the large owned
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
ta taxes on all the property including
 
04:13:04.750 --> 04:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
the parking lots which are available to
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
the general public to fish off in park
 
04:13:10.030 --> 04:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
and we pl them
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
ourselves so we met uh in a very cordial
 
04:13:17.070 --> 04:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
manner with with a mayor he refer us to
 
04:13:21.070 --> 04:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
the people who did the uh the appraisal
 
04:13:23.349 --> 04:13:23.359 align:start position:0%
we met with that gentleman and he was a
 
04:13:28.269 --> 04:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
very gentlemanly type of person um it
 
04:13:30.109 --> 04:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
turned out that his father was a Mason
 
04:13:32.189 --> 04:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
and his grandfather was but he wasn't
 
04:13:33.750 --> 04:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
and I said you should
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
be and he said well can Cloud the is
 
04:13:41.950 --> 04:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
that's another issue but why are now we
 
04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
being taxed why
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
now and he said the P part which I I I
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier was in inaccurate
 
04:13:54.910 --> 04:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
because the the misfiling of our
 
04:13:58.349 --> 04:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
report with the charitable trust
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
division of Department of
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
Justice that was inaccurate uh because
 
04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
that was misfiled that is a copy we gave
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
to the city annually on an annual basis
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
and that we weren't
 
04:14:17.910 --> 04:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
charitable so here's what's going
 
04:14:22.349 --> 04:14:22.359 align:start position:0%
on as towns get n get state appraises or
 
04:14:25.389 --> 04:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
organizations to praise the appraiser
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
looks at it and he said personally from
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
my point of view If I Was A city
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
councilman had the authority I would say
 
04:14:36.149 --> 04:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
these portions of your property are not
 
04:14:39.510 --> 04:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
taxable but I can't cuz I'll lose my
 
04:14:42.389 --> 04:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
license if I do and I said why would you
 
04:14:45.790 --> 04:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
do lose your license he said because the
 
04:14:48.149 --> 04:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
the division or the the Department of
 
04:14:52.109 --> 04:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
Justice has a special board they call it
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
which is used to be an old board that
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
took that the made repayment for land
 
04:15:00.070 --> 04:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
that was taken for highways primarily
 
04:15:04.030 --> 04:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
now has all these tax exemption requests
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
going to them bypassing the
 
04:15:11.229 --> 04:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
Community which was not the history
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
before so this is tumbling in from town
 
04:15:17.550 --> 04:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
to town as these appraisals are being
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
done because they say they have decided
 
04:15:23.910 --> 04:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
that you're not
 
04:15:27.349 --> 04:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
charitable now the they is the
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
board you would have to appeal to them
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
first after amount of money spent for
 
04:15:36.510 --> 04:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
legal counsel you don't want to go there
 
04:15:36.520 --> 04:15:38.070 align:start position:0%
legal counsel you don't want to go there
without

04:15:38.070 --> 04:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:15:41.109 --> 04:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
they can easily turn you down because
 
04:15:44.630 --> 04:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
they can say your chapter your chter
 
04:15:44.640 --> 04:15:46.590 align:start position:0%
they can say your chapter your chter
your

04:15:46.590 --> 04:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
organizational organization is not
 
04:15:53.790 --> 04:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
specifically a charity under the the
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law that's why you have this
 
04:16:02.830 --> 04:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
bill so it really isn't anything new
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
from what the authority used to be from
 
04:16:08.149 --> 04:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
the municipality but somehow the
 
04:16:10.510 --> 04:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
legislature allowed that authority to be
 
04:16:13.109 --> 04:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
taken from the
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
municipality and some might say well
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's may be a good idea maybe there's
 
04:16:21.109 --> 04:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
preferences but you know every exemption
 
04:16:24.870 --> 04:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
is open to public examination all these
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
requests for exemptions under charitable
 
04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh exemption have to have the documents
 
04:16:35.189 --> 04:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
of all your money all your expenses and
 
04:16:38.910 --> 04:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
I can tell anybody the Masons is not a
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
smoking and drinking club by any means
 
04:16:45.550 --> 04:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
they have high value system which I I
 
04:16:47.309 --> 04:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate and I think many people on
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
nun Masons appreciate but they're not
 
04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
just there to socialize because when you
 
04:16:54.269 --> 04:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
look at these
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
organizations that have limited
 
04:17:00.030 --> 04:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
membership they are giving
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
specifically five times the amount of
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
money in many cases than the taxes would
 
04:17:07.389 --> 04:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
allow them
 
04:17:09.790 --> 04:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
because they're giving it away but
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're not being called
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
charitable am I Lodge you give them
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels they give hands across
 
04:17:20.550 --> 04:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
the table which is somewhat similar they
 
04:17:22.830 --> 04:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
give to the Isaac club which is for
 
04:17:25.790 --> 04:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
people who drug abuse and on and on and
 
04:17:28.870 --> 04:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
on and all these social organizations
 
04:17:31.349 --> 04:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
are always wrapped around the
 
04:17:33.990 --> 04:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
communities where the lodge is located
 
04:17:37.229 --> 04:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
within the Bap County in my my case
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
because it's the only Lodge to build in
 
04:17:41.469 --> 04:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
that county so we we generally try to
 
04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
keep it within that Community rather
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
than give it to the American Cancer
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
Society and the hot all which great
 
04:17:52.030 --> 04:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
organizations this little
 
04:17:55.630 --> 04:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
organization is giving Almost 100% of
 
04:17:58.670 --> 04:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
his assets every year liquid assets
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
every year to charity in the
 
04:18:06.910 --> 04:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
community okay so why should you still
 
04:18:09.109 --> 04:18:09.119 align:start position:0%
be in that situation or why should we
 
04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
change the law why should you make the
 
04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
law that you can stay in the in the
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
condition to give money is that in many
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
cases if you do the
 
04:18:22.510 --> 04:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
math the amount of taxes that the
 
04:18:22.520 --> 04:18:24.429 align:start position:0%
math the amount of taxes that the
community

04:18:24.429 --> 04:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:18:28.349 --> 04:18:28.359 align:start position:0%
receives is less than the amount of
 
04:18:31.870 --> 04:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
money that the lodge generates for the
 
04:18:34.189 --> 04:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
social services within
 
04:18:37.349 --> 04:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
the loc local what they are give you one
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
case the Masons and the Ells got
 
04:18:43.870 --> 04:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
together we raised $5,000 for the uh New
 
04:18:46.750 --> 04:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Grand estate Children's
 
04:18:49.950 --> 04:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
Alliance this just W it took a massive
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
amount of effort but we had a concert
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
and we gave $55,000 big deal yeah and
 
04:18:59.590 --> 04:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
you look at the other organizations that
 
04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
give 50 to 60 or more thousands of
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
dollars that impact has a greater impact
 
04:19:08.469 --> 04:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
because they're given to local
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
organizations that spend the money
 
04:19:12.910 --> 04:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
locally Help the People locally and are
 
04:19:14.910 --> 04:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
not drifting off to some National
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
Organization where they spend 60% for
 
04:19:17.680 --> 04:19:18.910 align:start position:0%
Organization where they spend 60% for
administrative

04:19:18.910 --> 04:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
04:19:21.309 --> 04:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
costs we don't charge administrative
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
costs for what we do so in any way you
 
04:19:26.040 --> 04:19:26.870 align:start position:0%
costs for what we do so in any way you
work

04:19:26.870 --> 04:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:19:30.189 --> 04:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
it if you pass the bill you can
 
04:19:32.830 --> 04:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
straighten out I believe some of these
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
problems that some of the towns have had
 
04:19:40.510 --> 04:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
still Selectmen or giving exemptions to
 
04:19:42.870 --> 04:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
some but the day will come when they'll
 
04:19:46.109 --> 04:19:46.119 align:start position:0%
say they had to do it here there was no
 
04:19:48.630 --> 04:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
appeal or they did appeal and the state
 
04:19:51.510 --> 04:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
said you're not in this right category
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
because the way you wrote your chapter
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
or your Charter or your organizational
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
network doesn't say that your
 
04:20:01.630 --> 04:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
charity because Masons don't say they're
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
a charity they give charitable efforts
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
to the community so I'd ask you to to uh
 
04:20:11.189 --> 04:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
support this
 
04:20:15.269 --> 04:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
bill not just for Masons but to support
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
this bill for the communities because
 
04:20:21.630 --> 04:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
when the it isn't just a small number
 
04:20:23.790 --> 04:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
but the small number that are
 
04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
contributing just don't give cash they
 
04:20:29.870 --> 04:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
give time and all these volunteer
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
organizations they give their locations
 
04:20:36.830 --> 04:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
free in many cases don't charge anything
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
in our case the city of Lon gets a huge
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
parking lot that we pl for free and they
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
want to tax the parking lot which
 
04:20:49.269 --> 04:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense so uh I think if you
 
04:20:52.109 --> 04:20:52.119 align:start position:0%
pass this bill you will clarify the
 
04:20:57.070 --> 04:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
authority thank you very much thank you
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
questions repr
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:21:04.830 --> 04:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:21:09.309 --> 04:21:09.319 align:start position:0%
so Corporation is is not my area of of
 
04:21:12.429 --> 04:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
knowledge but I'm looking under our New
 
04:21:14.790 --> 04:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statutes in chapter
 
04:21:19.830 --> 04:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
292 corporations associations and Etc
 
04:21:22.710 --> 04:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
then if you go under a voluntary corop
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
corporations and associations there's a
 
04:21:28.349 --> 04:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
section that deals with charitable
 
04:21:32.670 --> 04:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
corporations is it possible for Masonic
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
um lodges or Masonic associations to
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
I guess incorporate under this section
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
and then that takes care of this you're
 
04:21:46.590 --> 04:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
not a charity you are a charity could
 
04:21:49.590 --> 04:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
you explain that good
 
04:21:49.600 --> 04:21:51.149 align:start position:0%
you explain that good
question

04:21:51.149 --> 04:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:21:55.269 --> 04:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
Masons are not organized as a charity in
 
04:21:58.990 --> 04:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
their organiz fraternal organizational
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
setup however they do support and urge
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
The Lodges to be charitable
 
04:22:11.469 --> 04:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
in the the one case I know
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
recently the auditor
 
04:22:18.950 --> 04:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
said well your organizational chapter
 
04:22:22.590 --> 04:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't on the bottom say when you
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
devolve or dissolve or when there's
 
04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
demolution that you must give that money
 
04:22:30.429 --> 04:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
to another
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
charity and they went one step further
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
they said you can only be organized for
 
04:22:38.910 --> 04:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
effort and I didn't understand where
 
04:22:45.790 --> 04:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
they had that legal power to say that
 
04:22:48.269 --> 04:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
except when a bureaucracy makes a
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
decision and you trying to change it not
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
fight them but trying to change it you
 
04:22:57.030 --> 04:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
need legal counsel in this case they're
 
04:22:58.349 --> 04:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
going to send you directly to the
 
04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice which is always
 
04:23:03.630 --> 04:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
going to uphold by saying it doesn't say
 
04:23:05.790 --> 04:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
this in your CH therefore you're not
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
chable that's the reason for the bill so
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
the the answer is that unless you
 
04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
specifically organize a certain way and
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
and dissolve a certain way right now the
 
04:23:23.950 --> 04:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
state doj subdivision of that board will
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
not recognize you as a charity and will
 
04:23:30.910 --> 04:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
say no to your appeal for
 
04:23:34.109 --> 04:23:34.119 align:start position:0%
exemption representative major thank you
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:23:38.670 --> 04:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
question are my dues to my Lodge tax tax
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
deductible no thank
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
you oh and I I just and with one thing
 
04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
of this hisory sir no huh I'm sorry I
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:55.429 --> 04:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
chairman are
 
04:23:59.790 --> 04:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
the organizational Charters or mission
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
statements contained within are they
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
identical for each Masonic Lodge or
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
each Masonic
 
04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
Association I I can only address that in
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
in two cases um I was involved
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
in two lodges but were owned by
 
04:24:24.189 --> 04:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
associations which you had to be a
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
member of that
 
04:24:28.990 --> 04:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
Lodge so it seemed that was one and the
 
04:24:32.269 --> 04:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
same except for organizational purposes
 
04:24:35.229 --> 04:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
that an organization was created and in
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
both cases
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
all right through the language after you
 
04:24:42.590 --> 04:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
get through the the the the the purposes
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
of Brotherhood and
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
charity specific language about making
 
04:24:51.109 --> 04:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
efforts to better the
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
community but that was not enough for
 
04:24:56.670 --> 04:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire they want you
 
04:24:59.550 --> 04:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
to be charitable charitable only they
 
04:25:01.590 --> 04:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
don't want you to be organized for a
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
fraternal organization to get together
 
04:25:05.830 --> 04:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
and talk about the things that you have
 
04:25:05.840 --> 04:25:06.630 align:start position:0%
and talk about the things that you have
great

04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
value and by doing that they're
 
04:25:13.070 --> 04:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
saying you'll never get in that c
 
04:25:15.109 --> 04:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
category because we're eventually going
 
04:25:18.550 --> 04:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
to say no to everybody the way your
 
04:25:21.710 --> 04:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
Charter is written one two organizations
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
I know of why they have that all the way
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
through the language of charitable
 
04:25:29.950 --> 04:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
purposes and and meet for that purpose
 
04:25:32.590 --> 04:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
because they weren't dissolved to go to
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
another charity they turned them down
 
04:25:40.189 --> 04:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chairman
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
followup out of curiosity why don't you
 
04:25:46.469 --> 04:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
organize as a
 
04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
501c3 well is a grandmas still
 
04:25:56.030 --> 04:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
here but uh you could
 
04:25:58.830 --> 04:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh Masons first were
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
organized as a Brotherhood as you'd say
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
and they are open to everybody of every
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
religion and Creed
 
04:26:12.510 --> 04:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
race sir I'm gonna you up one sec the
 
04:26:15.109 --> 04:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
quest specific question was yeah about
 
04:26:17.590 --> 04:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
organizing under a 5013c if you don't
 
04:26:20.790 --> 04:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
know the answer that's fine well I have
 
04:26:23.910 --> 04:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
to get to there okay if you could okay
 
04:26:26.269 --> 04:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
because fairly quickly because of the
 
04:26:27.550 --> 04:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
nature of that
 
04:26:30.670 --> 04:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
organization they were organized Grand
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
lodges were organized for that
 
04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
purpose despite the fact they gave
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
charity if you say well you have to be
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
organized as a charity as a Grand Lodge
 
04:26:47.790 --> 04:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
the Grand Lodge does not uh comply to
 
04:26:51.229 --> 04:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
that strict standard of being charitable
 
04:26:54.510 --> 04:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
charitable only thank you very much
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%

04:29:20.790 --> 04:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
county and actually probably caused some
 
04:29:22.469 --> 04:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
difficulty always caus this difficulty
 
04:29:23.710 --> 04:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
registering because there's no way to
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
split it up into multiple pieces like
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
the three cities um so um I know I know
 
04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
I'm in somewhat awkward position of
 
04:29:33.670 --> 04:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
trying to overturn a bill they which was
 
04:29:36.030 --> 04:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
originally your idea Mr chair but um
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm I'm basically just trying to
 
04:29:40.990 --> 04:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
put the straford county commissioner
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
districts back the way it was for many
 
04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
years I think as far as I can tell is
 
04:29:47.630 --> 04:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
from the beginning of times I haven't
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
found any record of when they did it
 
04:29:53.309 --> 04:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise um which is of one at large
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
district and there's many reasons why at
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
large district is the way to go for
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
straford County but one of them is of
 
04:30:01.950 --> 04:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
course it has a 0% those of you who
 
04:30:03.149 --> 04:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
follow R districting know you're
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
guaranteed a 0% population deviation
 
04:30:08.910 --> 04:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
um so anyway we're the only we're the
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
only one of the 10 counties which elects
 
04:30:13.590 --> 04:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
three County missioners at large um and
 
04:30:15.790 --> 04:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
actually I'm Prejudice you know I'm from
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
straford County so I think that's the
 
04:30:18.990 --> 04:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
best of the 10 counties but actually
 
04:30:20.189 --> 04:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
think that's probably how all the
 
04:30:21.870 --> 04:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
smaller counties should choose their
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um I mean maybe it makes
 
04:30:27.429 --> 04:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
sense for Hillsboro OR Rockingham but I
 
04:30:29.229 --> 04:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
don't think it makes sense for any of
 
04:30:30.830 --> 04:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
the small counties and we're like an
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
average size we're exactly almost
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
exactly average we're close to 10% of
 
04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
the population of the state
 
04:30:38.590 --> 04:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
um one thing's unique about it there
 
04:30:40.349 --> 04:30:40.359 align:start position:0%
isn't really any good way to split the
 
04:30:43.389 --> 04:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
county into three uh pieces um it's twoo
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
large of cities Rochester and do have
 
04:30:46.910 --> 04:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
almost the exactly the same number of
 
04:30:49.469 --> 04:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
residents and I guess so those you have
 
04:30:50.910 --> 04:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
written testimony direct your attention
 
04:30:52.109 --> 04:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
there's a little spread sheet in the
 
04:30:54.269 --> 04:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
back with the towns ranked in order by
 
04:30:56.910 --> 04:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh by by the towns and cities ranked in
 
04:30:59.590 --> 04:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
order by population and showing what the
 
04:31:01.070 --> 04:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
what their percentage of the population
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
is anyway so um do do and Rochester have
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
almost exactly the same number of
 
04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
residents each have 25% of the total
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
population that's 50% of the population
 
04:31:13.070 --> 04:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
of the county and 50% of the work the
 
04:31:16.429 --> 04:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
County government does right there
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
um My Town Durham it calls itself a town
 
04:31:22.710 --> 04:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
but for most terms of its governance it
 
04:31:25.469 --> 04:31:25.479 align:start position:0%
really is a city it main differences
 
04:31:29.870 --> 04:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
aside from uh aside from labeling or
 
04:31:31.910 --> 04:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
sign the fact we label oursel a town we
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have a mayor we have just have
 
04:31:36.389 --> 04:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
a Town Council chair but that's not
 
04:31:38.830 --> 04:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
quite the same thing as a mayor and uh
 
04:31:41.469 --> 04:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
we also have no Wards and the lack of
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
wards is Cru W talking about this bill
 
04:31:46.030 --> 04:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
because you can't divide Durham up into
 
04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
multiple pieces when you're diving up
 
04:31:51.149 --> 04:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
the electoral districts and um we're a
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
significantly larger than the smallest
 
04:31:55.510 --> 04:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
city which is summersworth so Durham has
 
04:31:57.109 --> 04:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
almost 12% of the population
 
04:32:00.670 --> 04:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
summersworth has uh 9% of the population
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
so collectively those three cities in
 
04:32:06.149 --> 04:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
Durham collectively comprise 7 1% of the
 
04:32:08.189 --> 04:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
County's population and also like a
 
04:32:09.950 --> 04:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
little complication when you
 
04:32:11.469 --> 04:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
redistricting is there's the town of
 
04:32:13.469 --> 04:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford which is surrounded entirely
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
by do and summersworth and then also by
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
Maine um and there's also Madbury which
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh mad it's also Madbury which just
 
04:32:25.790 --> 04:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
small town just south of south of just
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
south of Durham and then there's also
 
04:32:30.189 --> 04:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
actually if you count Madry durman Le
 
04:32:32.550 --> 04:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
and Rollinsford uh I haven't added up
 
04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
the exact numbers but it's close
 
04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
probably close 80% of the state's
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
population are those like in that half
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the of the county
 
04:32:43.950 --> 04:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
so uh all three of the Mayors they all
 
04:32:45.710 --> 04:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
expressed their opposition to dividing
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
their Community County Commissioner
 
04:32:49.950 --> 04:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
districts um and actually I think they
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
weren't thrilled that they were divided
 
04:32:55.389 --> 04:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
between the State Rep districts that and
 
04:32:58.030 --> 04:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
um also like historically the
 
04:32:59.469 --> 04:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the county delegation and
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities have always worked
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
together well they've always had a good
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
working relationship and there's broad
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
support for leaving things they are and
 
04:33:08.670 --> 04:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
I would say not much support for making
 
04:33:13.269 --> 04:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
the change that um was done last year so
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
the legislative history of the recent
 
04:33:16.750 --> 04:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
redistricting plan is uh short but
 
04:33:20.310 --> 04:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
convolute HB 270 was sponsored by by you
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and five other straford County
 
04:33:26.429 --> 04:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
Republicans um all I think either from
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
Rochester or from the northern part of
 
04:33:32.349 --> 04:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
the county um that bill at a hearing
 
04:33:34.109 --> 04:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
which I was doing something else that
 
04:33:35.470 --> 04:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
day so I didn't even attend the hearing
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
though I've watched the YouTube video
 
04:33:39.310 --> 04:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
and looked at the bill file um and it
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
was retained in committee a week after
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
its hearing and that seemed to be the
 
04:33:45.470 --> 04:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
end of it um three months later however
 
04:33:47.390 --> 04:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
in early may pretty close to the end of
 
04:33:50.269 --> 04:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
the 23 session Jim Gray set the chair of
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
the senate election law minicipal
 
04:33:54.189 --> 04:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
Affairs committee hly revived The
 
04:33:56.709 --> 04:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
Proposal embodied in 270 as a non-gain
 
04:33:59.629 --> 04:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
amendment to a bill called HB 270
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
hp75 and uh that was hurly passed on
 
04:34:06.029 --> 04:34:06.039 align:start position:0%
Party Line votes in the Senate um and
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
there were there were three didn't get
 
04:34:11.070 --> 04:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
to have a hearing in the house because I
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
guess they already had a hearing on on
 
04:34:15.629 --> 04:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
almost tical Bill already but there were
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
three procedural votes and they were all
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
division votes I don't know exactly who
 
04:34:22.029 --> 04:34:22.039 align:start position:0%
voted how but the they appear to be
 
04:34:23.789 --> 04:34:23.799 align:start position:0%
Partyline votes judging from the numbers
 
04:34:24.910 --> 04:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
I mean there may have
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
been I'm just speculating maybe a few
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
Republicans who flipped one way and a
 
04:34:30.910 --> 04:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
few Democrats who flip the other way but
 
04:34:33.150 --> 04:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
it was almost exactly the same as the
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
party division of the people who are
 
04:34:35.709 --> 04:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
sitting in the room pressing their
 
04:34:37.470 --> 04:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
buttons that day
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
so and this of course passing a
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
registrating plan in the middle of the
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
10year census cycle is highly unusual of
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
course as you know Mr chair you are I
 
04:34:47.230 --> 04:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
believe the vice chair of the house
 
04:34:49.869 --> 04:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee and um they're
 
04:34:52.269 --> 04:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
usually um only taken up immediately
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
after the desal desal census most
 
04:34:59.150 --> 04:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
recently in 20 the 2020 census and uh so
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
first of all the issue of changing the
 
04:35:02.990 --> 04:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
at large election of the straford County
 
04:35:04.349 --> 04:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
Commissioners never came up at all
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
during the redistrict debate which is
 
04:35:10.470 --> 04:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
um mostly in the last few months of 2021
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
and the first half of
 
04:35:16.670 --> 04:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
2022 um of course you were circumspect
 
04:35:18.269 --> 04:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
on mentioning that at those hearings
 
04:35:20.910 --> 04:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
I've looked at the bill files but other
 
04:35:22.830 --> 04:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
members did come right out and say it
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
that something that changed in second
 
04:35:29.390 --> 04:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
half of 20202 was uh the uh introduction
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
of the new nursing home plan which has
 
04:35:33.629 --> 04:35:33.639 align:start position:0%
been very controversial to say the least
 
04:35:35.670 --> 04:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
the uh and that was the supported by all
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
three of the com coming County
 
04:35:39.150 --> 04:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who are all Democrats and
 
04:35:41.310 --> 04:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
uh has for various reasons been
 
04:35:43.150 --> 04:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
vehemently opposed by the Republican
 
04:35:44.670 --> 04:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
minority County delegation I'm not
 
04:35:46.390 --> 04:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
really here to litigate that that's
 
04:35:49.629 --> 04:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
something that's going to be resolved uh
 
04:35:52.429 --> 04:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
probably probably later this year or
 
04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
pretty soon anyway or early next year so
 
04:35:55.709 --> 04:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
be once you hold your testimony there
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk about the election of
 
04:36:03.269 --> 04:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
straford County Commission nursing home
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
so I'm just saying that's that
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
we will speak to the bill yeah that was
 
04:36:11.709 --> 04:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
one items that are unrelated to the bill
 
04:36:13.990 --> 04:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
that was one of several issues that uh
 
04:36:16.830 --> 04:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
did come up during the HB 270 and 75
 
04:36:19.109 --> 04:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
hearings um members of the straford
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
county delegation did uh directly refer
 
04:36:24.029 --> 04:36:24.039 align:start position:0%
to that and they also there's a few
 
04:36:26.949 --> 04:36:26.959 align:start position:0%
other uh few other there's a few other
 
04:36:29.349 --> 04:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh minor issues or well smaller issues
 
04:36:33.590 --> 04:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
anyway so that's uh and uh anyway this
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
there that I don't have to go going to
 
04:36:36.670 --> 04:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
be more the nursing home that's in the
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
process of being resolved um also
 
04:36:40.629 --> 04:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
probably something I don't have my
 
04:36:42.429 --> 04:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
written tell someone to explain exactly
 
04:36:45.551 --> 04:36:45.561 align:start position:0%
how the legisl legislation works the
 
04:36:47.230 --> 04:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
legislation passed in
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
2023 well took effect 60 days after
 
04:36:52.029 --> 04:36:52.039 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor but it it applies
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
only to the upcoming election in 2024 so
 
04:36:57.150 --> 04:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
right now the at large districts are in
 
04:36:59.310 --> 04:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
place you know the commissioner seats do
 
04:37:03.310 --> 04:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
not become uh are not vacated um if if
 
04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
if it's too late in the I think it's too
 
04:37:07.470 --> 04:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
late in the uh cycle now to do it but if
 
04:37:11.230 --> 04:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
for some reason one of them uh resigned
 
04:37:15.070 --> 04:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
or whatever uh we would still choose it
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
according to the at large District so
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
that there would be and also if this
 
04:37:22.109 --> 04:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
bill passes as introduced um it would
 
04:37:24.349 --> 04:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
probably not be signed until after the
 
04:37:26.990 --> 04:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
filing period for the upcoming elections
 
04:37:31.470 --> 04:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
is so actually we would be unless uh
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
unless either this committee or you know
 
04:37:35.590 --> 04:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
the senate election law missal Affairs
 
04:37:37.510 --> 04:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee makes major changes or at
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
least changes the effective date we
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be having an election with the
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
three districts in September and then
 
04:37:47.310 --> 04:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
General November then we would go back
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
in 2026 um if you're to if you're to
 
04:37:53.551 --> 04:37:53.561 align:start position:0%
implement this for 2024 which I've in
 
04:37:55.029 --> 04:37:55.039 align:start position:0%
favor of you first of all you'd have to
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
get it through the process a lot quicker
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
than I expect it's going to and you'd
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
have to like put in some contingencies
 
04:38:03.830 --> 04:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh and I I discussed that with the
 
04:38:05.629 --> 04:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office who didn't
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
really take position one way or the
 
04:38:09.070 --> 04:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
other but they did tell me that just
 
04:38:10.310 --> 04:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
this was the best way to handle the
 
04:38:13.310 --> 04:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
effective datea issue so that's uh
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
that's basically my uh that's basically
 
04:38:17.070 --> 04:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
my summary I know you put a lot of work
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
into putting this plan together I will
 
04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
say one thing is uh the plan obviously
 
04:38:24.551 --> 04:38:24.561 align:start position:0%
it's unpopular first of all because it's
 
04:38:27.029 --> 04:38:27.039 align:start position:0%
been this way for 50 years or more and
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
most most people liked it the way it was
 
04:38:32.189 --> 04:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
um also the plan that was introduced it
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
just barely meets the standard
 
04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
statistical requirements for district
 
04:38:39.869 --> 04:38:39.879 align:start position:0%
and I do and I guess you pointed out Mr
 
04:38:41.590 --> 04:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
chair correctly you apparently use the
 
04:38:43.470 --> 04:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
same redistricting software I did that
 
04:38:47.109 --> 04:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
if you didn't split any cities you'd
 
04:38:50.670 --> 04:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
have a uh de population deviation of
 
04:38:53.230 --> 04:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
13.07% I so recall I got exactly the
 
04:38:54.750 --> 04:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
same number from the software that you
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
got so we uh but if you although
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
actually if you just you could have
 
04:39:01.949 --> 04:39:01.959 align:start position:0%
split summersworth into and gone a
 
04:39:03.990 --> 04:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
slightly smaller deviation but I I I
 
04:39:06.029 --> 04:39:06.039 align:start position:0%
like the at Large districts with the 0%
 
04:39:08.910 --> 04:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
deviation so I'm I'm not introducing my
 
04:39:10.429 --> 04:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
alternative plan I'll just mention that
 
04:39:12.910 --> 04:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
in case if that's route you want to go
 
04:39:14.629 --> 04:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
town to there other ways to split up the
 
04:39:16.750 --> 04:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
county so that's my that's my testimony
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
so I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:24.349 --> 04:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
any are there any
 
04:39:26.349 --> 04:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
testimony all right thank you do you
 
04:39:30.670 --> 04:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
have a a card represented
 
04:39:33.551 --> 04:39:33.561 align:start position:0%
Potenza no I don't have
 
04:39:35.709 --> 04:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
hers I think I think I pass mine around
 
04:39:42.030 --> 04:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:44.430 --> 04:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
yours I'm just trying to go in the order
 
04:39:46.150 --> 04:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
that we're supposed to
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
hear representative penzo if you're
 
04:39:50.310 --> 04:39:50.320 align:start position:0%

04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair my name is uh
 
04:40:05.788 --> 04:40:05.798 align:start position:0%
represent pres ative Kelly Penza
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
straford District 19 I wasn't prepared
 
04:40:10.350 --> 04:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
today to speak on this because I it was
 
04:40:13.390 --> 04:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a surprise um I was at all of
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
the testimony uh for your committee for
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
I guess it was called
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
hp75 uh I was also in the senate for
 
04:40:22.150 --> 04:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
that as
 
04:40:25.390 --> 04:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
well I won't be long-winded here this is
 
04:40:28.110 --> 04:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
really an essence of fairness and and
 
04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
balancing things out and why straford
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
county is the only County that has an
 
04:40:37.310 --> 04:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
atlaw large in in regards with voting
 
04:40:39.150 --> 04:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
people have been disenfranchised
 
04:40:43.628 --> 04:40:43.638 align:start position:0%
especially in the small towns all of
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
the all of the emphasis is always on
 
04:40:50.470 --> 04:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
Durham uh
 
04:40:54.270 --> 04:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
summersworth uh do and Rochester and
 
04:40:57.310 --> 04:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just really not fair um
 
04:40:58.510 --> 04:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of things that have
 
04:41:01.390 --> 04:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
happened in straford County um which you
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
guys know from the news I really think
 
04:41:06.150 --> 04:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
that we should be spending our time on
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
that and not on on this again because
 
04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
this is now settled um it's just it's
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
just really sad in Milton Milton Mills
 
04:41:18.910 --> 04:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh Farmington barington Lee um there's
 
04:41:22.708 --> 04:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
just been a lack of attention for the
 
04:41:25.628 --> 04:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
smaller towns in straford county and
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
because unfortunately the most votes
 
04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
come from those four that I told you and
 
04:41:33.868 --> 04:41:33.878 align:start position:0%
so when you run at large the people's
 
04:41:35.590 --> 04:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
voice is not being being heard and
 
04:41:38.070 --> 04:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's the taxpayer and that's who I
 
04:41:41.670 --> 04:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
have a fiduciary responsibility to um
 
04:41:44.030 --> 04:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about this
 
04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
just even regards with tax caps not
 
04:41:49.788 --> 04:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
being um you know because we we only
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
care really about the tax caps in the
 
04:41:53.310 --> 04:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
cities that were you know when the
 
04:41:54.910 --> 04:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
county raises their stuff it's going to
 
04:41:57.670 --> 04:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
be raised like 4.2% but we don't care so
 
04:41:59.550 --> 04:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
much about the small towns that have
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
instituted a tax cap and they're going
 
04:42:04.590 --> 04:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
to get hit hard so this just levels the
 
04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
playing field it it's it's really not a
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
um it's not a partisan issue it's an
 
04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
issue of fairness and um and I just I I
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
hope that uh you guys move in expedient
 
04:42:21.030 --> 04:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
to legislate and that we can move on to
 
04:42:23.430 --> 04:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
bigger better things in straford
 
04:42:25.590 --> 04:42:25.600 align:start position:0%

04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in straford County I'm a
 
04:43:01.948 --> 04:43:01.958 align:start position:0%
former two term member of this house I
 
04:43:04.590 --> 04:43:04.600 align:start position:0%
served on this Committee in the 1970s
 
04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
I'm also former two-term mayor of the
 
04:43:08.948 --> 04:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
city of Dober I'm here in support of
 
04:43:12.070 --> 04:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
this bill uh for a number of varying
 
04:43:14.990 --> 04:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
reasons uh which I'd like to go over
 
04:43:16.270 --> 04:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
with the committee and answer any
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
questions you may
 
04:43:21.150 --> 04:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
have historically in New Hampshire I've
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
served on the board of County
 
04:43:25.708 --> 04:43:25.718 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in straford county for 20
 
04:43:29.430 --> 04:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
terms almost 40 years historically
 
04:43:30.868 --> 04:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
what's happened in New Hampshire is
 
04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
whenever a county decides it's going to
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
deal with the commissioner districts
 
04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
that's always been handled by the county
 
04:43:37.390 --> 04:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
delegation historically if you go back
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
and look at the history the county
 
04:43:41.230 --> 04:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
delegation would meet and discuss
 
04:43:42.430 --> 04:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
whether they should have districts and
 
04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
not districts and how they wish to uh uh
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
elect their
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh and then that
 
04:43:50.470 --> 04:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
delegation would move that proposal
 
04:43:53.910 --> 04:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
forward and that's been the case uh
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
throughout history in this particular
 
04:43:59.390 --> 04:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
case during the redistricting
 
04:44:02.390 --> 04:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
process uh the committee met in in do
 
04:44:04.830 --> 04:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
and had a public Hearing in do uh uh and
 
04:44:09.430 --> 04:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
there was no uh public outcry or public
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
comment from anyone about creating
 
04:44:12.550 --> 04:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
districts in straford County for the
 
04:44:12.560 --> 04:44:13.390 align:start position:0%
districts in straford County for the
County

04:44:13.390 --> 04:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
County
 
04:44:15.470 --> 04:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh County Commissioners in
 
04:44:16.830 --> 04:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
straic County have been being elected at
 
04:44:19.310 --> 04:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
large since
 
04:44:23.788 --> 04:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
1856 uh and even during about 1880 when
 
04:44:25.750 --> 04:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
Caroll County and bellnap County were
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
created from straford County the
 
04:44:31.110 --> 04:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners remained elected at large
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
the major reason for that was because in
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
order to to meet the new one man one
 
04:44:37.070 --> 04:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
vote rules that were putting together
 
04:44:39.310 --> 04:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
put put in about 50 years
 
04:44:42.990 --> 04:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
ago you had to meet certain criteria and
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
one of those criteria in order to have
 
04:44:46.270 --> 04:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
that happen in straford County was you
 
04:44:49.310 --> 04:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
had to divide the cities in half which
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh which uh is what happened last year
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh with with the bill that was uh that
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
was formulated out of the
 
04:45:02.628 --> 04:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
Senate but the county delegation is our
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
County delegation has never even met on
 
04:45:07.310 --> 04:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
this bill number one last year's bill or
 
04:45:11.350 --> 04:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
this year's Bill uh there's kind of a
 
04:45:13.708 --> 04:45:13.718 align:start position:0%
misnomer going on around that that
 
04:45:16.030 --> 04:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
straic County will never elect a
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
republican uh and the small towns are
 
04:45:20.310 --> 04:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
never represented that's just that's
 
04:45:24.550 --> 04:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
just not true uh I served with Leo lard
 
04:45:26.910 --> 04:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
who was a former state senator a former
 
04:45:28.350 --> 04:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
member of this house he served on the
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
commission with me until his death he
 
04:45:31.470 --> 04:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
was from the town of
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
Milton I served over the Republican on
 
04:45:36.070 --> 04:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
the commission who was from straford his
 
04:45:38.550 --> 04:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
name was C schroer normally when the
 
04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
Republican Party puts up someone who was
 
04:45:42.628 --> 04:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
worth who has been worthy of voting for
 
04:45:44.670 --> 04:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
them most of the time they they've won
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
we had a Sheriff a a republican sheriff
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
in straford county for decades we had
 
04:45:53.310 --> 04:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
two of them in recent memory uh Sheriff
 
04:45:55.948 --> 04:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
Harold Knight who was from Madbury one
 
04:45:58.670 --> 04:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
of the smallest towns in straford
 
04:46:01.948 --> 04:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
county and Sheriff eses who served for
 
04:46:03.628 --> 04:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
about 20 years he was a republican he
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
was from the town of
 
04:46:08.190 --> 04:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
Milton so this idea that sh just doesn't
 
04:46:11.788 --> 04:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
elect Republicans is just it's just not
 
04:46:15.390 --> 04:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
accurate uh second thing that I want to
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
mention if I may is
 
04:46:20.708 --> 04:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
that the process of jury mandering
 
04:46:23.470 --> 04:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
districts out of the cycle is a very
 
04:46:23.480 --> 04:46:24.990 align:start position:0%
districts out of the cycle is a very
slippery

04:46:24.990 --> 04:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
slippery
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
slope I've discussed this with many
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional attorneys
 
04:46:33.708 --> 04:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
and the slope that we're on here is that
 
04:46:37.590 --> 04:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
if there's a change in control of the
 
04:46:39.390 --> 04:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
parties in either the house of the
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
senate in the future if you will allow
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
this jury mandering to take place out of
 
04:46:47.948 --> 04:46:47.958 align:start position:0%
the cycle it allows that party to again
 
04:46:50.110 --> 04:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
rejer Mander those districts
 
04:46:52.750 --> 04:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
again now the Supreme Court has ruled in
 
04:46:54.990 --> 04:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
2004 that that was unconstitutional once
 
04:46:58.830 --> 04:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature has met its statutory
 
04:47:01.510 --> 04:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
obligation by setting up
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
districts uh that it's met its obl ation
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't be done again until the
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
next federal
 
04:47:12.430 --> 04:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
census straven County was voted on the
 
04:47:14.430 --> 04:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
district was to remain at
 
04:47:16.590 --> 04:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
large that was brought forward by the
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee and passed by the
 
04:47:20.590 --> 04:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and now we've in the off
 
04:47:24.030 --> 04:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
year and then then the following year uh
 
04:47:25.628 --> 04:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
they decide the legislature decideed to
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
take this particular
 
04:47:29.830 --> 04:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
action there's many of us number one who
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
believe it's
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I have been not I have
 
04:47:35.310 --> 04:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
been contct conted by hundreds and
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
hundreds of Voters in straford County
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
who have called our office and very very
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
upset about the fact that they can't
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
vote for all three County Commissioners
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
anymore if you were have hold up Hearing
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
in straford County regarding this bill
 
04:47:48.070 --> 04:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
you would have
 
04:47:50.310 --> 04:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly overwhelmingly support to
 
04:47:53.590 --> 04:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
leave the way Commissioners are elected
 
04:47:53.600 --> 04:47:56.150 align:start position:0%
leave the way Commissioners are elected
alone

04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
alone
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
the the amendment that was passed last
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
year that came out of a committee of
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
conference uh the bill out of a
 
04:48:05.270 --> 04:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
committee of conference in the Senate we
 
04:48:07.230 --> 04:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
were given there was harm created as a
 
04:48:09.628 --> 04:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
result of that those amendments we were
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
told at the time by Senator gray that we
 
04:48:17.070 --> 04:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
had to agree to his uh jury mandering of
 
04:48:21.910 --> 04:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
straford County uh to prevent the three
 
04:48:23.788 --> 04:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
of us from having to run against each
 
04:48:25.868 --> 04:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
other two of us are going to have to run
 
04:48:28.670 --> 04:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
against each other uh in a primary now
 
04:48:30.110 --> 04:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
the way the bill was designed it was
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
designed this way for Pure political
 
04:48:33.000 --> 04:48:35.270 align:start position:0%
designed this way for Pure political
reasons

04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:48:37.708 --> 04:48:37.718 align:start position:0%
Senator gray offered an amendment uh
 
04:48:39.030 --> 04:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
during the committee of conference that
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
would prevent all three existing
 
04:48:42.990 --> 04:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from having to run against
 
04:48:43.000 --> 04:48:43.788 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from having to run against
each

04:48:43.788 --> 04:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
each
 
04:48:46.030 --> 04:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
other but he did so in a form of
 
04:48:47.868 --> 04:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
blackmail for lack of a better term he
 
04:48:49.830 --> 04:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
simply said you either agree to us or
 
04:48:52.270 --> 04:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to leave this alone which
 
04:48:56.230 --> 04:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
created harm that I'm sure the courts
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
are not going to accept because of that
 
04:49:01.230 --> 04:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
basically you you need to take it or
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
leave it type of
 
04:49:02.920 --> 04:49:04.868 align:start position:0%
leave it type of
attitude

04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
attitude
 
04:49:04.878 --> 04:49:06.788 align:start position:0%
attitude
so

04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:09.270 --> 04:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh in discussing with the association
 
04:49:11.788 --> 04:49:11.798 align:start position:0%
for counties uh this concern and dealing
 
04:49:14.548 --> 04:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
with in talking with legal counsel it
 
04:49:17.788 --> 04:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
opens up an interesting dichotomy for
 
04:49:19.350 --> 04:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature moving
 
04:49:22.708 --> 04:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
forward if this is allowed to stand
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
there are some that say that there's a
 
04:49:26.590 --> 04:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
position that they take that say well if
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
we've never touched it if we never if we
 
04:49:30.590 --> 04:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
didn't deal with it we can change it
 
04:49:33.510 --> 04:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
whenever we want and that's a very
 
04:49:36.910 --> 04:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
slipper slope you're on okay the Supreme
 
04:49:39.548 --> 04:49:39.558 align:start position:0%
Court says you can't do that you do it
 
04:49:41.310 --> 04:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
once and they've done it once in
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
straford left it alone and they came
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
back and wanted to play with
 
04:49:49.868 --> 04:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
it if you allow that in every County
 
04:49:49.878 --> 04:49:50.670 align:start position:0%
it if you allow that in every County
every

04:49:50.670 --> 04:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
County through this precedent would be
 
04:49:56.270 --> 04:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to change the election of any
 
04:49:58.670 --> 04:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
District that was not changed in the in
 
04:50:00.510 --> 04:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
the as a result of the last
 
04:50:02.948 --> 04:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
redistricting which means basically if
 
04:50:05.830 --> 04:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't mess with it left it alone
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
that they would be allowed to come back
 
04:50:10.590 --> 04:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
and change it now there was many
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner districts in the in the
 
04:50:15.708 --> 04:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
state that were not
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
changed but they could be by setting
 
04:50:21.510 --> 04:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
precedent in this manner now whether
 
04:50:23.110 --> 04:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
they'd be challenged or not in court is
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
that's a separate issue but it would
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
allow a party in power to do this and
 
04:50:28.830 --> 04:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has been pretty clear
 
04:50:31.110 --> 04:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
about this saying that you can't do this
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
you can Jer Mander at once if the party
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
in power is in power at the time at the
 
04:50:38.670 --> 04:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
time that the district initial districts
 
04:50:42.030 --> 04:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
were established you can jury Mander it
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
then but you cannot do that you can't do
 
04:50:46.990 --> 04:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
it after the fact which is what this
 
04:50:51.070 --> 04:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
bill did it did it all after the fact uh
 
04:50:54.310 --> 04:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
once it and we believe it's
 
04:50:56.270 --> 04:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so the association of
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
counties has looked at this and
 
04:51:03.270 --> 04:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
unanimously uh support this bill uh to
 
04:51:06.310 --> 04:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
try to find a legislative remedy uh
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
without having a legal
 
04:51:11.470 --> 04:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
remedy uh and uh so I'm bringing that to
 
04:51:13.230 --> 04:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
your attention because of the harm it
 
04:51:16.070 --> 04:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
created uh the way it was done the
 
04:51:17.548 --> 04:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
process that was used there was no
 
04:51:20.430 --> 04:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
Hearing in straford County at all for
 
04:51:23.390 --> 04:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
the people of stra County to weigh in it
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
was done by a a creative legislative
 
04:51:29.708 --> 04:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
process I'll give Senator gray a pat on
 
04:51:30.868 --> 04:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
the back for
 
04:51:34.750 --> 04:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
that but it's Constitution ality is in
 
04:51:37.510 --> 04:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
question and I think the the legislature
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
should write
 
04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
it um we appear here I'm here with my
 
04:51:43.390 --> 04:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues commissioner Rolo and
 
04:51:45.390 --> 04:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner Watson we're not they're
 
04:51:46.788 --> 04:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
not going to plan on testifying because
 
04:51:48.510 --> 04:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
they don't want to repeat the issues
 
04:51:51.750 --> 04:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
that I put out uh in front of you uh but
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
I want to play lay aside this misnomer
 
04:51:55.830 --> 04:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
that a republican can't get elected in
 
04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
straford County that's just it's just
 
04:51:59.628 --> 04:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
not accurate it's not historically
 
04:52:04.430 --> 04:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
accurate uh and uh there is
 
04:52:06.270 --> 04:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why we've had a his
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
history in straford county of being a
 
04:52:12.350 --> 04:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
very Progressive County and and leading
 
04:52:14.750 --> 04:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
this state on issues like Drug Court
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
mental health court I could go on and on
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
and on the reason for that is because
 
04:52:20.670 --> 04:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
the County Commissioners aren't dealing
 
04:52:22.270 --> 04:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
with their own
 
04:52:24.390 --> 04:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
districts I've been president of the
 
04:52:25.788 --> 04:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
association of counties I've been
 
04:52:27.070 --> 04:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
president of the County Commissioners
 
04:52:29.948 --> 04:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
Council in this state for 30 years and
 
04:52:31.590 --> 04:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
in all those other counties those the
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who elected our districts
 
04:52:34.590 --> 04:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
protect their own
 
04:52:37.868 --> 04:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
districts it it causes
 
04:52:41.590 --> 04:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
dissension it causes uh the ability to
 
04:52:44.548 --> 04:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
deal making to to occur we don't have
 
04:52:46.150 --> 04:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
that in straford County because we all
 
04:52:48.350 --> 04:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
work for the same constituency in the
 
04:52:50.430 --> 04:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
end you don't have that happening in
 
04:52:52.230 --> 04:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
other counties and if you look
 
04:52:54.030 --> 04:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
historically what's happened uh you'll
 
04:52:55.590 --> 04:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
see some political dysfunction and
 
04:52:56.750 --> 04:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
always the public always has an
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go in and vote and change
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
it but in straford County it's Unique
 
04:53:03.310 --> 04:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
because in straford County the voter has
 
04:53:05.390 --> 04:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to vote for its
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
executive branch it can change the
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
executive branch with its vote and being
 
04:53:13.230 --> 04:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
a a student of history and of the
 
04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution I appreciate the fact that
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
I have that ability to be able to
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
control the executive branch with my
 
04:53:23.390 --> 04:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
vote and I and this bill last year took
 
04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
away that that right for tens of
 
04:53:28.350 --> 04:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
thousands of
 
04:53:30.310 --> 04:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
people so I'm hoping that you will
 
04:53:32.788 --> 04:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
reconsider the bill uh and vote ought to
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
pass on this particular and I'll be
 
04:53:35.948 --> 04:53:35.958 align:start position:0%

04:57:32.910 --> 04:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
vote and they can still see these votes
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
live they can see them on YouTube they
 
04:57:37.948 --> 04:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
can read in the paper they can online I
 
04:57:39.868 --> 04:57:39.878 align:start position:0%
Believe by printing it on the ballot it
 
04:57:43.430 --> 04:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
is election heing so all this repeal
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
does is just prevents it from being
 
04:57:47.070 --> 04:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
printed on the
 
04:57:49.708 --> 04:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
ballot um give you a quick example from
 
04:57:51.868 --> 04:57:51.878 align:start position:0%
my town currently we have Warren article
 
04:57:54.670 --> 04:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
number three uh we're asking the voters
 
04:57:56.590 --> 04:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
to appropriate $2.9
 
04:57:58.590 --> 04:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
Million last month on this warrant
 
04:58:01.390 --> 04:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
article Our Town Council voted Town
 
04:58:04.868 --> 04:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
Council voted 5 budget voted 70 in
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
favor these votes could all be seen live
 
04:58:10.110 --> 04:58:10.120 align:start position:0%
or in person or on YouTube and I don't
 
04:58:11.230 --> 04:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
believe they need to be printed on the
 
04:58:13.230 --> 04:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
ballot when these items are printed on
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
the ballot I believe it becomes election
 
04:58:20.470 --> 04:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
heing a example um Mrs Smith comes to
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
vote uh she's heard about Warren article
 
04:58:25.750 --> 04:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
3 but she's still unsure what to do she
 
04:58:27.510 --> 04:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
reads Warren article 3 and Noti is the
 
04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
last thing the very last sentence on the
 
04:58:32.868 --> 04:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
warrant article is Town Council voted 5
 
04:58:35.470 --> 04:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
bud budg committee voted seven all she
 
04:58:38.470 --> 04:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
knows Hey Ron Dunn is my town
 
04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
counselor I like him I'm going to vote
 
04:58:43.110 --> 04:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
in favor of
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
this how is it any different than me
 
04:58:46.910 --> 04:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
standing right there next to her in the
 
04:58:48.470 --> 04:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
ballot Booth telling her to vote for
 
04:58:51.708 --> 04:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
this my vote is on that ballot saying I
 
04:58:55.150 --> 04:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
wanted this I voted for it so Mr Smith
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
comes in and says okay yeah I I like him
 
04:58:58.070 --> 04:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote for
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
this um I'm not allowed to wear a pin or
 
04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
a hat or bring a sign into the
 
04:59:06.830 --> 04:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
electioneering Booth but my my vote is
 
04:59:07.990 --> 04:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:59:08.000 --> 04:59:12.708 align:start position:0%
on that
ballot

04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:15.430 --> 04:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
um I submit to you that my vote on the
 
04:59:19.150 --> 04:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
ballot has much more power than any sign
 
04:59:22.470 --> 04:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
or pin or any sticker or hat that
 
04:59:23.470 --> 04:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
somebody might
 
04:59:26.470 --> 04:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
wear um I've done a lot of research on
 
04:59:27.910 --> 04:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
this throughout the United throughout
 
04:59:30.910 --> 04:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I found that over in
 
04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
my research over 95% of the time the
 
04:59:35.788 --> 04:59:35.798 align:start position:0%
municipal body and the budget committee
 
04:59:37.788 --> 04:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
however they vote is how the warrant
 
04:59:39.270 --> 04:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
article will turn
 
04:59:42.590 --> 04:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
out so if the municipality votes in
 
04:59:44.390 --> 04:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
favor the people vote in favor of it
 
04:59:46.750 --> 04:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
they vote against it most times it's
 
04:59:46.760 --> 04:59:48.390 align:start position:0%
they vote against it most times it's
voted

04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
voted
 
04:59:50.350 --> 04:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
against currently in New Hampshire the
 
04:59:51.990 --> 04:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
Miss bodies are required to vote on
 
04:59:54.150 --> 04:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
warrant articles these individual votes
 
04:59:56.150 --> 04:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
are printed on the ballot thus when a
 
04:59:57.390 --> 04:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
private citizen goes into the voting
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
booth they can see how the municipal
 
05:00:00.788 --> 05:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
bodies voted and how the budget
 
05:00:01.948 --> 05:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
committee voted on these warrant
 
05:00:04.390 --> 05:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
articles these registered voters have
 
05:00:06.868 --> 05:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
the potential to have their vote swayed
 
05:00:09.948 --> 05:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
in the ballot Booth when they see how
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
their municipal government and budget
 
05:00:11.400 --> 05:00:12.990 align:start position:0%
their municipal government and budget
committee

05:00:12.990 --> 05:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:00:16.510 --> 05:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
voted all this all this bill does is
 
05:00:18.310 --> 05:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
remove it from being printed on the
 
05:00:20.910 --> 05:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
ballot it does not stop any municipality
 
05:00:23.708 --> 05:00:23.718 align:start position:0%
from voting on it and I believe that
 
05:00:25.628 --> 05:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
when the vote is put on the ballot it is
 
05:00:27.788 --> 05:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
election heing thank you for your time
 
05:00:29.230 --> 05:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and I'll take any
 
05:00:31.470 --> 05:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative dun
 
05:00:33.788 --> 05:00:33.798 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
05:00:35.150 --> 05:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
05:00:37.788 --> 05:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
question what if we were just to remove
 
05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
the voting record from the ballot itself
 
05:00:42.830 --> 05:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
and just leave the regular warrant
 
05:00:45.030 --> 05:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
article on there the question thank you
 
05:00:48.030 --> 05:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
for the question that's
 
05:00:51.510 --> 05:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable representative
 
05:00:53.708 --> 05:00:53.718 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:00:56.470 --> 05:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so if I
 
05:00:58.270 --> 05:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
understand your testimony correctly you
 
05:01:00.868 --> 05:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
said that a person can
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
attend a meeting in person or they could
 
05:01:07.470 --> 05:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
watch it live stream um or a recording
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
later and they can observe the governing
 
05:01:14.788 --> 05:01:14.798 align:start position:0%
body and or the budget committee talking
 
05:01:16.990 --> 05:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
about a budget or a warrant article and
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
then you know voting isn't that the same
 
05:01:22.270 --> 05:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
they they still have that same knowledge
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
of that
 
05:01:26.590 --> 05:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
vote I just I'm
 
05:01:29.750 --> 05:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
not it's confusing to me so so they can
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
have the knowledge there but if they
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
didn't they weren't able to you know
 
05:01:37.070 --> 05:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
attend the meeting in person or follow
 
05:01:39.270 --> 05:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
up then somehow that's different if it's
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
printed on the warrant when they go to
 
05:01:46.270 --> 05:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
vote if I if it is a SP2 town I'm
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
confused thank you for the question I'll
 
05:01:50.948 --> 05:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
give you an example um direct to your
 
05:01:53.788 --> 05:01:53.798 align:start position:0%
question so if a person is watching it
 
05:01:56.910 --> 05:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
live the municipal body is voting and
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
they can see their vote they know how
 
05:01:59.948 --> 05:01:59.958 align:start position:0%
their counselor their budget committee
 
05:02:04.708 --> 05:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
voted okay if they are not there in
 
05:02:06.310 --> 05:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
person they can read it in the newspaper
 
05:02:08.990 --> 05:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
they can see it online or they can hear
 
05:02:11.190 --> 05:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
from their local people that how they
 
05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
voted okay that's about the same as
 
05:02:15.868 --> 05:02:15.878 align:start position:0%
having someone holding a sign out front
 
05:02:17.750 --> 05:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
of the polling place right saying vote
 
05:02:21.708 --> 05:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
Yes on three okay my argument is when
 
05:02:24.190 --> 05:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
it's put on the ballot in the ballot
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
Booth it's election earing I can't bring
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
a sign in and say vote Yes on three but
 
05:02:32.030 --> 05:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
I can put my vote on that ballot and I
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
submit to you that my my vote is more
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
important than a sign out front um you
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
know if if I vote against something or
 
05:02:41.708 --> 05:02:41.718 align:start position:0%
vote for something that has much more
 
05:02:44.910 --> 05:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
impact swaying someone's opinion than a
 
05:02:47.230 --> 05:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
sign or a pin or a hat I'm not allowed
 
05:02:49.110 --> 05:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
to wear those into the election Booth so
 
05:02:51.390 --> 05:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
05:02:54.670 --> 05:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
argument repr
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
Gallagher uh so this bill is sounding
 
05:03:01.390 --> 05:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
really familiar to me and I feel like
 
05:03:03.750 --> 05:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
we've had a similar one to it before I'm
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if you looked into the
 
05:03:06.080 --> 05:03:07.430 align:start position:0%
wondering if you looked into the
legislative

05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
history um of other similar bills that
 
05:03:12.270 --> 05:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
I've tried to do the same thing in the
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
past and um discovered what happened to
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
um any of those previous
 
05:03:23.070 --> 05:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
versions thank you for the question ol
 
05:03:24.750 --> 05:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
did not inform me of anything so I'm not
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
any representative
 
05:03:31.868 --> 05:03:31.878 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:03:33.868 --> 05:03:33.878 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
05:03:37.510 --> 05:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
testimony do you realize that the
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
process is that the selectman the
 
05:03:43.030 --> 05:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
council and the budget committee go
 
05:03:44.270 --> 05:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
through a
 
05:03:46.910 --> 05:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
process that they look at the
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
information that they have and the
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
warrant article that is presented to the
 
05:03:55.590 --> 05:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
town deser don't you believe that the
 
05:03:58.670 --> 05:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
they deserve the opinion of both those
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
bodies after all the work they've gone
 
05:04:03.750 --> 05:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
through in the
 
05:04:06.470 --> 05:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
finding out if that warrant article is
 
05:04:09.510 --> 05:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
in fact in the best interest of the town
 
05:04:11.230 --> 05:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I absolutely
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
I said that in my testimony I absolutely
 
05:04:14.390 --> 05:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
agree they should vote there's no
 
05:04:15.708 --> 05:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
there's no question they should vote I
 
05:04:16.708 --> 05:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
just don't believe it should be printed
 
05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
on the ballot in the in the election
 
05:04:23.190 --> 05:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
Booth followup go ahead how how then
 
05:04:26.350 --> 05:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
would the voter get that information
 
05:04:29.788 --> 05:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
that uh after the information that the
 
05:04:32.830 --> 05:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh bodies have looked at that and either
 
05:04:36.190 --> 05:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
vote yay or nay because I don't think
 
05:04:39.030 --> 05:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's fair to assume that because it's
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
not that way in my town that every uh
 
05:04:46.830 --> 05:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation is five or three to zero
 
05:04:49.670 --> 05:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's four to two it's 3
 
05:04:53.628 --> 05:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
to2 uh so uh I had a petition article
 
05:04:56.910 --> 05:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
where it was one to two and it
 
05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
P so I don't think don't you believe
 
05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
that the people should have the right to
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
the deliberation of those two
 
05:05:07.548 --> 05:05:07.558 align:start position:0%
bodies thank you for the question
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely I believe that that's what I
 
05:05:10.030 --> 05:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
said in my testimony I absolutely
 
05:05:11.708 --> 05:05:11.718 align:start position:0%
believe that 100% I just don't believe
 
05:05:14.070 --> 05:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
it should be printed on the
 
05:05:17.230 --> 05:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
ballot no no one more quick question no
 
05:05:20.110 --> 05:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
Representative no no no yep uh
 
05:05:23.230 --> 05:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
representative H so along that lines
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
because to what representative goth is
 
05:05:28.788 --> 05:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
talking you could have a petition uh a
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
petition warrant that's placed on your
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
ballot but the petition warrant is not
 
05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
supported by the governing body in which
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
case you can put an explan in on warrant
 
05:05:42.270 --> 05:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
articles and maybe I hope I'm correct on
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
this but you can place an explanation
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
that sits at the bottom of the warrant
 
05:05:49.310 --> 05:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
article and it in which case if it was a
 
05:05:51.548 --> 05:05:51.558 align:start position:0%
petition warrant article and the
 
05:05:54.150 --> 05:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
governing body did not in fact support
 
05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
it you could place that language on
 
05:05:59.708 --> 05:05:59.718 align:start position:0%
there so your your Amendment would strip
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
the ability of of the voter to know
 
05:06:03.548 --> 05:06:03.558 align:start position:0%
whether whether it was recommended or
 
05:06:06.190 --> 05:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
Not by the governing body on the thank
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
you for the question on the ballot sir
 
05:06:10.030 --> 05:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
yes on the ballot it would not strip
 
05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
them from their ability to learn that
 
05:06:13.708 --> 05:06:13.718 align:start position:0%
through other means just not in the
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
ballot Booth representative
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
yull thank you uh thank you for taking
 
05:06:21.310 --> 05:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
the question it seems like
 
05:06:26.070 --> 05:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
um the issue is kind of at least I think
 
05:06:29.110 --> 05:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
foreign to this this committee and much
 
05:06:29.120 --> 05:06:30.788 align:start position:0%
foreign to this this committee and much
more

05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:06:34.390 --> 05:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
um likely to to be handled by election
 
05:06:39.470 --> 05:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
law committee where um there's special
 
05:06:42.270 --> 05:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions for what can be done inside
 
05:06:45.390 --> 05:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
of a ballot area versus outside of a
 
05:06:47.868 --> 05:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
polling booth and you know in the public
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
in general and so would I be correct in
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
in in saying that you
 
05:06:57.948 --> 05:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
are the only reason why you're putting
 
05:07:01.070 --> 05:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
this forward is because of
 
05:07:04.230 --> 05:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
the that distinction between what is
 
05:07:06.350 --> 05:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
going on in the polling place and what
 
05:07:08.150 --> 05:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
is allowed and disallowed inside the
 
05:07:11.150 --> 05:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
polling place versus what is allowed and
 
05:07:14.310 --> 05:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
disallowed out in the public as far as
 
05:07:16.310 --> 05:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh electioneering because you can
 
05:07:19.230 --> 05:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
electioneer outside of the polling place
 
05:07:20.948 --> 05:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
which is completely legal but you can't
 
05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
electioneer inside the polling place is
 
05:07:26.830 --> 05:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
that my correct understanding of C the
 
05:07:28.430 --> 05:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
thrust of your bill thank you for the
 
05:07:30.190 --> 05:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
question so
 
05:07:32.990 --> 05:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
my Crux of this question is is to repeal
 
05:07:36.110 --> 05:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
that RSA that requires it to be printed
 
05:07:38.910 --> 05:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
on the ballot this RSA says it must be
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
printed on the ballot so I just want to
 
05:07:44.350 --> 05:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
repeal that so it is not printed on the
 
05:07:47.230 --> 05:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
ballot that answers your
 
05:07:50.548 --> 05:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
question representative Maj thank you Mr
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%

05:07:53.430 --> 05:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
question just curious if you have
 
05:07:56.430 --> 05:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
contacted Dr or the Attorney General
 
05:07:58.470 --> 05:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
Andor the Secretary of State to to have
 
05:08:00.390 --> 05:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
their way in I actually thank you for
 
05:08:01.830 --> 05:08:01.840 align:start position:0%

Mr SC Secretary of State and uh I sat
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
down and had lunch with him we had about
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
a 20-minute conversation and he said
 
05:08:10.548 --> 05:08:10.558 align:start position:0%
that he uh he sees both sides of this
 
05:08:12.150 --> 05:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
issue and he said that he would not
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
support or uh he would he would remain
 
05:08:16.910 --> 05:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
neutral on the on the
 
05:08:20.628 --> 05:08:20.638 align:start position:0%

question do do you to your recollection
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
when citizens put a petition and signed
 
05:08:30.510 --> 05:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
signatures to get a war article on and
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
supporting an article are their names
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
printed on the ballot they are not thank
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%

05:08:44.788 --> 05:08:44.798 align:start position:0%

November will have about 8,000 voters so

05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
um trying to get those other that that
 
05:09:18.548 --> 05:09:18.558 align:start position:0%
the a printed version of slman voted 50
 
05:09:22.110 --> 05:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
on this is uh affecting the decisions of
 
05:09:22.120 --> 05:09:23.150 align:start position:0%
on this is uh affecting the decisions of
the

05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:09:25.390 --> 05:09:25.400 align:start position:0%

05:09:27.628 --> 05:09:27.638 align:start position:0%
come thank you for the question I
 
05:09:29.910 --> 05:09:29.920 align:start position:0%

representative

05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:09:39.750 --> 05:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:09:42.030 --> 05:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
so there's a
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
it is it your understanding that there's
 
05:09:46.708 --> 05:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
a difference between a warrant and the
 
05:09:49.070 --> 05:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
ballot the actual ballot that somebody
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
votes on in a voting booth thank you for
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
the question it's in our town anyway
 
05:09:57.110 --> 05:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing Ian the warrant
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
article is printed on the ballot and you
 
05:10:02.830 --> 05:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
vote right on it follow up go ahead
 
05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that not
 
05:10:09.430 --> 05:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
all cities and towns municipalities are
 
05:10:09.440 --> 05:10:10.708 align:start position:0%
all cities and towns municipalities are
SP2

05:10:10.708 --> 05:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
SP2
 
05:10:16.190 --> 05:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:19.910 --> 05:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
correct represent VI Kell thank you
 
05:10:22.990 --> 05:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering about the the
 
05:10:28.948 --> 05:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
impact of your bill I'm not sure that it
 
05:10:32.510 --> 05:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
will have the impact that you're
 
05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
intending so the law seems to require
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
the printing of the ballot but the
 
05:10:41.150 --> 05:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
repeal of that does not forbid the
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
printing of it on the ballot and your
 
05:10:45.830 --> 05:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
statement before seems like to say that
 
05:10:49.350 --> 05:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
they may printed on the ballot in which
 
05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
case it doesn't actually address your
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
your concern if the the legislative body
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
still chooses to print it on the ballot
 
05:11:01.230 --> 05:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
even though it's not required is that
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
05:11:05.948 --> 05:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
understanding I would just say that
 
05:11:08.150 --> 05:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
if if it's repealed then they wouldn't
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
be required
 
05:11:12.948 --> 05:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
to but yeah it could be but it wouldn't
 
05:11:15.150 --> 05:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
be required right now it's required if
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
they cannot choose not to print it on
 
05:11:19.390 --> 05:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
there represent
 
05:11:22.548 --> 05:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
G uh so one point that's been brought up
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
is that um people can just uh watch the
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
deliberations on their live stream uh
 
05:11:35.470 --> 05:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
how however we had a separate bill uh
 
05:11:37.270 --> 05:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
before this committee that we referred
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
to um interim study
 
05:11:43.948 --> 05:11:43.958 align:start position:0%
requiring um that municipalities do
 
05:11:47.670 --> 05:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
Drive live streaming so wouldn't the
 
05:11:52.708 --> 05:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
fact that um that bill or that other
 
05:11:56.110 --> 05:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
legislators have deemed that um deemed
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
that bill to be necessary seem to imply
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
to you that no they can't actually just
 
05:12:03.070 --> 05:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
watch it on the live stream currently
 
05:12:05.708 --> 05:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
that there are some municipalities that
 
05:12:10.350 --> 05:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
don't already live stream their um
 
05:12:10.360 --> 05:12:12.830 align:start position:0%
don't already live stream their um
deliberative

05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
deliberative
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
sessions thank you for the
 
05:12:17.230 --> 05:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
question um if I understand your
 
05:12:17.240 --> 05:12:18.030 align:start position:0%
question um if I understand your
question

05:12:18.030 --> 05:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
correctly in that case they could see it
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
in the newspaper they could um they be
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
other methods for them to get reporting
 
05:12:31.030 --> 05:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
on how we voted as as a body they
 
05:12:33.150 --> 05:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to printed on the ballot
 
05:12:34.708 --> 05:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
for them to get the results there's many
 
05:12:36.070 --> 05:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
other options for
 
05:12:39.868 --> 05:12:39.878 align:start position:0%
them representa Guth thank you Mr
 
05:12:42.150 --> 05:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
chairman my question got a little bit
 
05:12:46.350 --> 05:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
longer because uh I I started to assume
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
that you assume that all the voters are
 
05:12:49.200 --> 05:12:50.310 align:start position:0%
that you assume that all the voters are
very

05:12:50.310 --> 05:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:12:53.910 --> 05:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable if what how would a voter
 
05:12:57.470 --> 05:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
know how to vote if they're going to the
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
ballot to vote on that bond issue that
 
05:13:04.190 --> 05:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
they don't want you know they're very
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
emotional about that so they go in and
 
05:13:07.750 --> 05:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
they vote on that but they don't know a
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
darn thing about all the other warrant
 
05:13:11.390 --> 05:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
articles how would they have some
 
05:13:14.230 --> 05:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
guidance to vote on those other articles
 
05:13:16.430 --> 05:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I actually
 
05:13:18.350 --> 05:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
believe that most voters probably come
 
05:13:22.110 --> 05:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
in not knowledgeable so my feeling is
 
05:13:25.070 --> 05:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
that by printing the ballot how we voted
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
on this has more power that I'm telling
 
05:13:30.390 --> 05:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
somebody to vote on this because I voted
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
in favor of it and I believe that has
 
05:13:36.070 --> 05:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
more power than any other method of
 
05:13:38.270 --> 05:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
electioneering because they do come in
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
uninformed sometimes on these articles
 
05:13:42.310 --> 05:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
like you suggesting I'm agree I agree
 
05:13:43.948 --> 05:13:43.958 align:start position:0%
with you on that and I'm saying that by
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
printing my vote on this on this war
 
05:13:48.628 --> 05:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
article it has much more power because
 
05:13:49.990 --> 05:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
someone's going to say I know him and he
 
05:13:51.548 --> 05:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
voted for this I'm going to vote for it
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
Point well taken thank
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
you seeing no more further questions
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative dun
 
05:14:08.310 --> 05:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:09.788 --> 05:14:09.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:14:12.670 --> 05:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
committee members I'm going to read you
 
05:14:16.150 --> 05:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
the election law I'm going to read first
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
paragraph and um opening paragraph and
 
05:14:20.670 --> 05:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
two because the middle one is about what
 
05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're wearing but um for the Reon I'm
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Christine Perez I'm from
 
05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
London Dair representing District 16 in
 
05:14:32.270 --> 05:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
Rockingham election ering means means
 
05:14:35.150 --> 05:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
visibly displaying or audibly
 
05:14:37.590 --> 05:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
disseminating information that a
 
05:14:39.948 --> 05:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable person would believe
 
05:14:44.070 --> 05:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
explicitly advocates for or against any
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
candidate political party or measure
 
05:14:49.750 --> 05:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
being voted election earing includes but
 
05:14:51.708 --> 05:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
is not limited to and this is the Clos
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
part so I'm going to go on to
 
05:14:57.548 --> 05:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
Distributing or posting a card a hand
 
05:15:00.708 --> 05:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
Bill a poster a placard picture pin
 
05:15:05.070 --> 05:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
sticker circular or any form of
 
05:15:07.990 --> 05:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
communication that a reasonable person
 
05:15:11.708 --> 05:15:11.718 align:start position:0%
would believe explicitely advocates for
 
05:15:14.990 --> 05:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
or against any candidate political party
 
05:15:19.030 --> 05:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
or measure that being said and the fact
 
05:15:21.150 --> 05:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
that you brought up about informed
 
05:15:25.270 --> 05:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
voters I feel very strongly that we need
 
05:15:29.830 --> 05:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
to have informed voters I think maybe if
 
05:15:32.110 --> 05:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
we had informed voters
 
05:15:35.310 --> 05:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
we're informed when we vote we look into
 
05:15:38.350 --> 05:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
the bills and our informed voters and I
 
05:15:42.270 --> 05:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
think this takes away from people um
 
05:15:44.030 --> 05:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
actually going out and seeing what
 
05:15:47.670 --> 05:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
they're voting on and why is that being
 
05:15:50.350 --> 05:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
on that ballot any different than me as
 
05:15:53.310 --> 05:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
an electorate official being out in
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
front handing out stuff which I'm
 
05:15:58.990 --> 05:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to do handing out
 
05:16:01.788 --> 05:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
recommendations for what warrant article
 
05:16:04.708 --> 05:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
or what I should vote on it's really no
 
05:16:06.830 --> 05:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
different now many
 
05:16:09.510 --> 05:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
towns yes they put them on the ballot
 
05:16:13.510 --> 05:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
but they also send out or have available
 
05:16:14.910 --> 05:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
for people
 
05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
information about what is being voted on
 
05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
I have examples here actually they're
 
05:16:22.990 --> 05:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
from Windam uh one is put out by the
 
05:16:25.948 --> 05:16:25.958 align:start position:0%
school board one is put out by the town
 
05:16:27.788 --> 05:16:27.798 align:start position:0%
that's where people can get their
 
05:16:31.548 --> 05:16:31.558 align:start position:0%
information we in londondary have um
 
05:16:33.470 --> 05:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
we're very fortunate that we have a
 
05:16:36.868 --> 05:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
weekly newspaper uh that goes to every
 
05:16:40.350 --> 05:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
home to inform them but I personally
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
feel that I want people voting in my
 
05:16:47.230 --> 05:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
town or any Town who are informed who
 
05:16:51.430 --> 05:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
are just not going in and following what
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
Ron Dunn put down because I don't always
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
agree with Ron Dunn I want people to be
 
05:17:01.150 --> 05:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
informed and if you literally take what
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
the election provision is putting that
 
05:17:08.150 --> 05:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
information on the ballot is definitely
 
05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
a form of election earing thank you
 
05:17:15.070 --> 05:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:17:20.590 --> 05:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
05:17:29.948 --> 05:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:31.948 --> 05:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
binski good afternoon afternoon my name
 
05:17:34.270 --> 05:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
is Richard binsky I am a resident of the
 
05:17:37.510 --> 05:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
town of lary and for full disclosure I'm
 
05:17:39.310 --> 05:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
the one that ask this to be brought
 
05:17:41.948 --> 05:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
forward and the reason
 
05:17:44.470 --> 05:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
being what was just read by
 
05:17:47.110 --> 05:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative Perez is in contrast to
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
what is allowed to be done in the
 
05:17:52.430 --> 05:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
ballot the state wants it both ways the
 
05:17:53.708 --> 05:17:53.718 align:start position:0%
way it's written
 
05:17:58.230 --> 05:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
currently the ballot when you have a
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
vote by the Town Council in your budget
 
05:18:02.990 --> 05:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee I've talked to many of my
 
05:18:04.510 --> 05:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
neighbors I'm
 
05:18:07.030 --> 05:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
very involved in the town I've been the
 
05:18:10.350 --> 05:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
town Treasurer and they say hey I voted
 
05:18:13.230 --> 05:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
for S and Sh I said why well because of
 
05:18:16.030 --> 05:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
what was on the ballot I said but you
 
05:18:18.030 --> 05:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
aware this is what's actually going on
 
05:18:19.548 --> 05:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
you didn't get the full truth and I'll
 
05:18:20.990 --> 05:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
give you a couple examples I'll do this
 
05:18:22.270 --> 05:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
as quickly as I can because I know
 
05:18:25.990 --> 05:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
you're behind they say no we didn't know
 
05:18:29.230 --> 05:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
that I just went by what they said now
 
05:18:32.510 --> 05:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
also our budgetary committee in our town
 
05:18:35.670 --> 05:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
is the vatory only they have zero
 
05:18:39.390 --> 05:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
power so who cares what the vote is they
 
05:18:41.470 --> 05:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
have no power that's actually on our
 
05:18:43.590 --> 05:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
ballot this year to try to get it so
 
05:18:45.510 --> 05:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
they do have
 
05:18:48.390 --> 05:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
power so a couple of examples of why
 
05:18:51.030 --> 05:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
this needs to go away back in 2019 we
 
05:18:53.350 --> 05:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
had our Police Department put in for a
 
05:18:55.150 --> 05:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
new generator for the police
 
05:18:57.230 --> 05:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
station um they presented it a
 
05:18:58.990 --> 05:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
deliberative session they presented it
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
as it's beyond its useful life that it's
 
05:19:03.868 --> 05:19:03.878 align:start position:0%
had major repairs it needs to be
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
replaced none of which was true I was
 
05:19:09.910 --> 05:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
not at the deliberative I wasn't able to
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
go but I watched it and I started asking
 
05:19:15.670 --> 05:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
questions after they all approved it to
 
05:19:18.030 --> 05:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
put it on the ballot the generator is a
 
05:19:19.750 --> 05:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
commercial generator they're good for
 
05:19:22.190 --> 05:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
about 30,000 hours if they maintain for
 
05:19:23.750 --> 05:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
normal usage before they need anything
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
major as had 533 hours on it I asked for
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
the maintenance records took six months
 
05:19:31.590 --> 05:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
for them to give it to me and only after
 
05:19:33.788 --> 05:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
I gave him a 91a would they give me the
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance records maintenance records
 
05:19:37.110 --> 05:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
showed exactly what I thought they were
 
05:19:38.910 --> 05:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
going to show never been a problem with
 
05:19:41.110 --> 05:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
the generator they replace the transfer
 
05:19:43.470 --> 05:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
switch which makes takes the power from
 
05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
the generator and puts it into the
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
building but that has nothing to do with
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
the generator so that was
 
05:19:52.030 --> 05:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
$175,000 that got voted in it got voted
 
05:19:53.390 --> 05:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
in by the people I could give you the
 
05:19:56.190 --> 05:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
exact figures of you know who voted what
 
05:19:58.150 --> 05:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
because they it was misrepresentative by
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
those in charge they knew they were
 
05:20:02.628 --> 05:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
doing this because the town manager had
 
05:20:04.350 --> 05:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
called one of the captains of the police
 
05:20:06.190 --> 05:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
department said' we got extra money well
 
05:20:08.750 --> 05:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
Town never has extra money it's taxpayer
 
05:20:11.670 --> 05:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
money what do you need we need a new
 
05:20:14.110 --> 05:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
generator so they come up they concocted
 
05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
the story that wasn't true long story
 
05:20:20.230 --> 05:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
short after I exposed all this and the
 
05:20:21.750 --> 05:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
fact they said they were going to trade
 
05:20:24.390 --> 05:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
the old Generator in to offset the new
 
05:20:25.670 --> 05:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
one why would you trade it in if it's
 
05:20:27.948 --> 05:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
beyond its useful life and no good they
 
05:20:29.150 --> 05:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
were going to use the new one as a
 
05:20:32.190 --> 05:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
backup to the backup
 
05:20:33.990 --> 05:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
you can't always trust your elected
 
05:20:36.670 --> 05:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
officials no offense I talk
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
bluntly hopefully they bleed you down
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
the right Road more times than
 
05:20:43.830 --> 05:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
not so what happened they never spent
 
05:20:47.070 --> 05:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
the money because they got exposed they
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
police chief come in and said oh I know
 
05:20:52.110 --> 05:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
this is a CIP Capital Improvement number
 
05:20:54.910 --> 05:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
one priority immediate need we have to
 
05:20:57.230 --> 05:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
have it right away and after it was
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
exposed oh we'll take a look at this
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
again in 10 years but people voted for
 
05:21:04.110 --> 05:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
it and there was kind of an uproar when
 
05:21:05.788 --> 05:21:05.798 align:start position:0%
I put an article in the paper and people
 
05:21:08.070 --> 05:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
said well I voted because they said 5
 
05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
and I think it was 60 on the budget
 
05:21:11.590 --> 05:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
committee on this particular vote I
 
05:21:12.910 --> 05:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know so I voted the way they
 
05:21:15.548 --> 05:21:15.558 align:start position:0%
voted get it off the ballot let people
 
05:21:18.270 --> 05:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
educate themselves I educate myself on
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
everything been in town since 85 been in
 
05:21:23.230 --> 05:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire since'
 
05:21:25.470 --> 05:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
69 this year we have another Warren
 
05:21:28.190 --> 05:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
article going on that's been
 
05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
misrepresented they want to put pickle
 
05:21:31.548 --> 05:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
ball courts in they went out and got
 
05:21:33.510 --> 05:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
quotes they have a pickle ball committee
 
05:21:35.110 --> 05:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's fine you know people want it
 
05:21:37.110 --> 05:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's fine if they voted in they got
 
05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
quotes on it that um for high and low
 
05:21:44.548 --> 05:21:44.558 align:start position:0%
they got the quotes based upon the land
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
being ready to go that it's engineering
 
05:21:50.030 --> 05:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
you know been done well it hasn't been
 
05:21:52.430 --> 05:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
done the land's covered with trees they
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
haven't ex they haven't told people any
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
of this I've got the information here I
 
05:21:58.430 --> 05:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
had to beg them for a week to give me
 
05:22:00.030 --> 05:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
the minutes to the meeting and the
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
committee chair won't call me back for a
 
05:22:04.590 --> 05:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
week I've been trying to get so they
 
05:22:07.190 --> 05:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
voted and this wasn't a 5060 this was
 
05:22:09.548 --> 05:22:09.558 align:start position:0%
like a 41 on the town to approved the
 
05:22:11.430 --> 05:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
pickle ball courts you've been given bad
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
information and I think it was uh 43 to
 
05:22:18.628 --> 05:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
approve it on the budget committee again
 
05:22:20.350 --> 05:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
people go to the ballot they see these
 
05:22:23.430 --> 05:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
votes printed there and they just go
 
05:22:26.548 --> 05:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
along with it I talked to hundreds of
 
05:22:28.830 --> 05:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
people in town and they say yeah I
 
05:22:30.390 --> 05:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
didn't know so I just went with was on
 
05:22:32.830 --> 05:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
the ballot they need to educate
 
05:22:35.070 --> 05:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
themselves you know you shouldn't have
 
05:22:37.548 --> 05:22:37.558 align:start position:0%
to you shouldn't have to beg people to
 
05:22:39.310 --> 05:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
get educated when they go and vote
 
05:22:40.590 --> 05:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
there's something on the ballot that I
 
05:22:43.190 --> 05:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
don't understand I either know about you
 
05:22:44.510 --> 05:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
know find out ahead of time or I don't
 
05:22:46.110 --> 05:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
vote on it because I don't know what
 
05:22:48.110 --> 05:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
would be right or wrong on that
 
05:22:50.350 --> 05:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
particular warrant article this is
 
05:22:53.868 --> 05:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
directly engineering even um there was a
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
letter that was we got
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
back from the
 
05:22:59.878 --> 05:23:01.470 align:start position:0%
back from the
state

05:23:01.470 --> 05:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:23:03.030 --> 05:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
from oral
 
05:23:06.470 --> 05:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
Finch uh Secretary of State's office New
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Law requires that the
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
government body and budget committee
 
05:23:10.470 --> 05:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations be printed in the
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
warrant article on the warrant and on
 
05:23:14.750 --> 05:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
the ballot while the recommendations may
 
05:23:16.990 --> 05:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
fall within the definition of
 
05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
electioneering the recommendations are
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
exempt from any prohibition that might
 
05:23:23.510 --> 05:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
apply because the law requires them well
 
05:23:25.110 --> 05:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's great and dandy and I understand
 
05:23:26.548 --> 05:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
that but it's
 
05:23:29.190 --> 05:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
in exact opposite of what your
 
05:23:31.030 --> 05:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
electioneering laws say you can't have
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
it both ways so that's why I I brought
 
05:23:36.190 --> 05:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
it Forward I know for a fact from
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
talking to many people they don't
 
05:23:39.830 --> 05:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
educate themselves my own daughter and
 
05:23:41.470 --> 05:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
son-in-law live in town they don't know
 
05:23:43.310 --> 05:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
what's going on they come and ask me
 
05:23:45.070 --> 05:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
they're like H we don't want to
 
05:23:48.190 --> 05:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
know so if you have something that's the
 
05:23:49.350 --> 05:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
last thing people say I don't know how
 
05:23:51.310 --> 05:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
to vote so I'm going to vote you watch
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
If you eliminate that you're going to
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
see votes changing in
 
05:23:58.110 --> 05:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
towns and yes somebody brought up or
 
05:24:00.150 --> 05:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
what if they voted not to support
 
05:24:00.160 --> 05:24:01.430 align:start position:0%
what if they voted not to support
something

05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:24:03.708 --> 05:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
well I can't have it both ways and only
 
05:24:06.548 --> 05:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
want it when it's seven you know 504 to
 
05:24:09.150 --> 05:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
take it off and when it's 0 to five
 
05:24:12.070 --> 05:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
against it you know have it on it's not
 
05:24:14.270 --> 05:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
how it works people need to educate
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
themselves I'm going to be 64 years old
 
05:24:19.270 --> 05:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
and I educate myself you can't you know
 
05:24:21.230 --> 05:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's what you got to do so that is the
 
05:24:22.868 --> 05:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
reason I brought it up it's in contrast
 
05:24:25.390 --> 05:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
to the law it does influence people's
 
05:24:27.548 --> 05:24:27.558 align:start position:0%
votes go out and talk to people and
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
does thank you for your test
 
05:24:34.430 --> 05:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:24:36.510 --> 05:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
testimony I have one more pink card on
 
05:24:50.270 --> 05:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:52.948 --> 05:24:52.958 align:start position:0%
ol my name is uh Jeremy Olsen I

the committee thank you for allowing me
 
05:25:01.470 --> 05:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill today I was the
 
05:25:04.110 --> 05:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
town of Grafton over this very issue
 
05:25:09.310 --> 05:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
hp120 reverses the bad decision that
 
05:25:12.070 --> 05:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
came out of that case the case was um
 
05:25:14.830 --> 05:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
Jeremy Olson versus town of Grafton 168
 
05:25:18.628 --> 05:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
NH 563 from 2016 the we had other
 
05:25:20.150 --> 05:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs involved as representative
 
05:25:22.548 --> 05:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
Tom PL uh Chris Ken jabish and our
 
05:25:25.990 --> 05:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
attorney was Brandon Ross so um I moved
 
05:25:27.070 --> 05:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
up to
 
05:25:29.830 --> 05:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
graft I moved up to Grafton in the year
 
05:25:31.548 --> 05:25:31.558 align:start position:0%
2010 and and I immediately began
 
05:25:33.310 --> 05:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
attending the town meetings voting
 
05:25:35.430 --> 05:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
getting involved in the town I actually
 
05:25:37.590 --> 05:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
organized a group of people who were
 
05:25:39.350 --> 05:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
interested in getting involved and one
 
05:25:40.750 --> 05:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
of the things people like doing was
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
writing petition warant articles to get
 
05:25:45.788 --> 05:25:45.798 align:start position:0%
on the ballot um I did this for four or
 
05:25:47.910 --> 05:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
five years and it's a town of 1300
 
05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
people and I got up to 50 people that
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
were interested in getting involved in
 
05:25:54.190 --> 05:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
town politics we usually get about 35 of
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
these people to attend the sb2
 
05:25:58.670 --> 05:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions Grafton is a very
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
spread out Town it has 50 miles dirt
 
05:26:02.830 --> 05:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
roads they actually say it has the most
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
dirt roads in the entire State and um so
 
05:26:06.948 --> 05:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
I and a few of the other people we took
 
05:26:09.590 --> 05:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
it upon ourselves to drive around town
 
05:26:10.948 --> 05:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
ask people what they wanted to put on
 
05:26:13.510 --> 05:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
the ballot then collect the signatures
 
05:26:15.150 --> 05:26:15.160 align:start position:0%
because it took I think 25 signatures to
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
get something on the ballot and graft
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
and so me and like three or four other
 
05:26:19.830 --> 05:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
people we went all over town helping
 
05:26:22.150 --> 05:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
people get involved most of the waren
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
articles that we put on were things that
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
were to downsize or limit local
 
05:26:28.708 --> 05:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
government things that our Selectmen
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
generally didn't like seeing appearing
 
05:26:33.070 --> 05:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
on the B bot finally in
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
2015 the selectman decided to add quote
 
05:26:38.670 --> 05:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
the selectman do not recommend this
 
05:26:40.948 --> 05:26:40.958 align:start position:0%
article to every single one of the
 
05:26:43.910 --> 05:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
articles that we put on the ballot there
 
05:26:46.430 --> 05:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
were three other petition warant
 
05:26:48.230 --> 05:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
articles that year from from other
 
05:26:50.230 --> 05:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
people they didn't put a recommendation
 
05:26:52.708 --> 05:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
one way or another on those articles
 
05:26:54.548 --> 05:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
they only printed do not recommend on
 
05:26:56.670 --> 05:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
every single one that I am the group of
 
05:26:58.750 --> 05:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
people I was working with submitted they
 
05:27:00.868 --> 05:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
didn't print a a vote t they just
 
05:27:03.070 --> 05:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
printed do not recommend on every single
 
05:27:05.788 --> 05:27:05.798 align:start position:0%
one and as um the representatives that
 
05:27:08.670 --> 05:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
testified before us before me spoke that
 
05:27:10.390 --> 05:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
I see that clearly as electioneering
 
05:27:11.708 --> 05:27:11.718 align:start position:0%
they didn't like the kind of stuff we
 
05:27:14.830 --> 05:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
were doing and they were just basically
 
05:27:17.110 --> 05:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get their opinion inserted on
 
05:27:19.030 --> 05:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
the ballot so that's what people see
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
when they're about to vote on it as
 
05:27:22.948 --> 05:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
everybody else had already said nobody's
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
allowed like I can't go into the ballot
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
and say please vote Yes on my article I
 
05:27:27.910 --> 05:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
can't hang something up in the ballot
 
05:27:29.628 --> 05:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
box but the Selectmen essentially are
 
05:27:31.390 --> 05:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
05:27:34.150 --> 05:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
um we researched the rsas we found this
 
05:27:37.628 --> 05:27:37.638 align:start position:0%
very RSA is 32 colon 5 we spoke with a
 
05:27:39.470 --> 05:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
um an attorney Brandon Ras he agreed and
 
05:27:42.430 --> 05:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
we sued it ended up going to the um
 
05:27:46.750 --> 05:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and they um the way the
 
05:27:48.990 --> 05:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
law is written all the combination of
 
05:27:50.548 --> 05:27:50.558 align:start position:0%
Elections was the court admitted it's
 
05:27:52.750 --> 05:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
vague it's contradictory and they
 
05:27:54.990 --> 05:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
actually had to dig through State House
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
transcripts going back to 2009 it was
 
05:28:01.350 --> 05:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
sb38 to find that the way this thing was
 
05:28:03.708 --> 05:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
written actually allowed them to print
 
05:28:05.788 --> 05:28:05.798 align:start position:0%
the recommendation on the ballot because
 
05:28:07.510 --> 05:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
the way we interpreted and our attorney
 
05:28:09.150 --> 05:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
agreed was that it was just about money
 
05:28:11.310 --> 05:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
articles none of our articles were about
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
money but they still found a way to
 
05:28:15.510 --> 05:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
print do not recommend on our articles
 
05:28:18.628 --> 05:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
and the court affirmed that decision and
 
05:28:21.708 --> 05:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
um after we lost that case I ended up
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
giving up trying to organize all these
 
05:28:25.310 --> 05:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
people to put stuff on the ballot and I
 
05:28:26.990 --> 05:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
ended up moving back to Manchester a few
 
05:28:30.110 --> 05:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
years ago and um so I support this bill
 
05:28:32.788 --> 05:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
AB absolutely 100% support this bill it
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
will prevent the Selectmen from what is
 
05:28:37.750 --> 05:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
essentially electioneering on the ballot
 
05:28:39.470 --> 05:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
people who want to place warn articles
 
05:28:41.628 --> 05:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
on the ballot should feel free to do so
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
without feeling that they're being
 
05:28:45.548 --> 05:28:45.558 align:start position:0%
interfered with by the town government
 
05:28:47.270 --> 05:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
whom some of those articles are you know
 
05:28:49.470 --> 05:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
trying to limit the power of and in the
 
05:28:51.270 --> 05:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
the case I was working here this
 
05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
directly led to a reduction in civic
 
05:28:55.830 --> 05:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
participation in Grafton like I said we
 
05:28:58.230 --> 05:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
had 35 people showing up at town meeting
 
05:28:59.750 --> 05:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
most of those people stopped going to
 
05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
town meeting self included after this
 
05:29:04.708 --> 05:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
stuff happened one recommendation I
 
05:29:06.548 --> 05:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
think would be if if this bill as it's
 
05:29:07.788 --> 05:29:07.798 align:start position:0%
written is
 
05:29:10.230 --> 05:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
unpalatable I'd recommend amending the
 
05:29:13.350 --> 05:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
bill or amending the rsas to restrict
 
05:29:15.868 --> 05:29:15.878 align:start position:0%
the recommendation so it's only on money
 
05:29:17.948 --> 05:29:17.958 align:start position:0%
articles it does seem reasonable to me
 
05:29:19.510 --> 05:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
that like on a money article say someone
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
petitions you know I want $6 million to
 
05:29:23.430 --> 05:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
build a new library and the town doesn't
 
05:29:25.230 --> 05:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
have the money that seems reasonable
 
05:29:26.470 --> 05:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
that the budget committee might want to
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
be able to say we don't have the money
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
we recommend against like what they did
 
05:29:31.670 --> 05:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
in grafted is these articles had nothing
 
05:29:33.310 --> 05:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
to do with money and they just said no
 
05:29:35.590 --> 05:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
no no no on every single one and every
 
05:29:38.548 --> 05:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
single one did fail that year um thank
 
05:29:39.990 --> 05:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to testify today I'd
 
05:29:42.548 --> 05:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to take any questions
 
05:29:44.470 --> 05:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you fa testimony representative
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
05:29:49.708 --> 05:29:49.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question so would you think it
 
05:29:51.628 --> 05:29:51.638 align:start position:0%
was reasonable for the Selectmen to put
 
05:29:53.708 --> 05:29:53.718 align:start position:0%
on their website for instance what their
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations were and maybe a brief
 
05:29:58.150 --> 05:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
expl explanation of what the reasoning
 
05:30:01.030 --> 05:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
was as opposed to and then removing it
 
05:30:02.990 --> 05:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
from the Articles themselves that are on
 
05:30:05.788 --> 05:30:05.798 align:start position:0%
the ballot oh yes thank thank you for
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
the question um I absolutely think it's
 
05:30:09.270 --> 05:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable if they want to discuss them
 
05:30:10.708 --> 05:30:10.718 align:start position:0%
and then like they have meeting minutes
 
05:30:11.948 --> 05:30:11.958 align:start position:0%
you know they have a selectman's meeting
 
05:30:13.948 --> 05:30:13.958 align:start position:0%
in my town in that town every two weeks
 
05:30:14.910 --> 05:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
and the meeting minutes will get
 
05:30:16.190 --> 05:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
published on the website and if they
 
05:30:18.150 --> 05:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to discuss them and just say like
 
05:30:19.670 --> 05:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
we disagree with this here's why we have
 
05:30:21.270 --> 05:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
a rationale for it if they want to put
 
05:30:23.390 --> 05:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
that on the website that would be fine I
 
05:30:24.510 --> 05:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
would have no problem with that if the
 
05:30:26.350 --> 05:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
selectman want to stand out out in like
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
the electioneering allowed area on
 
05:30:30.390 --> 05:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
Election Day and like hand something out
 
05:30:31.628 --> 05:30:31.638 align:start position:0%
that's their business as long as they're
 
05:30:33.470 --> 05:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
not F falling a follow some other law
 
05:30:34.868 --> 05:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
that I'm not aware of I would have no
 
05:30:36.750 --> 05:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
problem with that it's just that key of
 
05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
it's it's literally printed right on the
 
05:30:40.830 --> 05:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
ballot so people read this article and
 
05:30:42.910 --> 05:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
then directly down there it says select
 
05:30:44.548 --> 05:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
and say don't vote for this that's the
 
05:30:45.868 --> 05:30:45.878 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that I and the other
 
05:30:48.150 --> 05:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
people here to have a problem with thank
 
05:30:49.830 --> 05:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:30:54.270 --> 05:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question could you tell me
 
05:30:57.750 --> 05:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
how many you gave it an example of um
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
petitioned warrant articles in the town
 
05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
of graft
 
05:31:03.270 --> 05:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
I think over a number of years how many
 
05:31:05.548 --> 05:31:05.558 align:start position:0%
of those petition warrant articles were
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
advisory only versus something that were
 
05:31:11.070 --> 05:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
actionable that is an excellent question
 
05:31:12.590 --> 05:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking that when we would
 
05:31:14.270 --> 05:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
go to deliberative session when they
 
05:31:15.788 --> 05:31:15.798 align:start position:0%
went through the ball they would often
 
05:31:18.948 --> 05:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
tell us this is advisory only many of
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
them in fact were advisory only so it
 
05:31:23.270 --> 05:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
didn't even have an impact on the town
 
05:31:24.788 --> 05:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
government if these things wereth to
 
05:31:29.070 --> 05:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
pass um just a couple examples um one
 
05:31:30.948 --> 05:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
thing like to see if the town will vote
 
05:31:32.708 --> 05:31:32.718 align:start position:0%
to instruct the select board and budget
 
05:31:34.510 --> 05:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
committee to work on reducing the budget
 
05:31:36.910 --> 05:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
for by 10% over the next 3 years we
 
05:31:38.390 --> 05:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the power to force it but we
 
05:31:40.670 --> 05:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
would ask them to do that we had two or
 
05:31:43.868 --> 05:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
three that would hold on it was the
 
05:31:45.628 --> 05:31:45.638 align:start position:0%
question was more a little more specific
 
05:31:49.350 --> 05:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
how many not so much getting into the
 
05:31:52.990 --> 05:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
you yeah sorry um I probably say but
 
05:31:55.628 --> 05:31:55.638 align:start position:0%
this particular year probably about 75%
 
05:31:57.470 --> 05:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
of them would have been non would have
 
05:31:59.190 --> 05:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
been advisory only there was one or two
 
05:32:01.868 --> 05:32:01.878 align:start position:0%
that definitely were under specific rsas
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
that would order the town to do
 
05:32:07.670 --> 05:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
something but most were um advisory only
 
05:32:10.230 --> 05:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
05:32:12.948 --> 05:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none that was the last
 
05:32:15.510 --> 05:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
pink card I had thank you for your

read okay the time being after 2:30 when
 
05:34:46.868 --> 05:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
this bill was scheduled to be heard um
 
05:34:48.910 --> 05:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
it's a little past 3 so I'm going to
 
05:34:52.590 --> 05:34:52.600 align:start position:0%

05:35:21.230 --> 05:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
straford I'm here to introduce HB
 
05:35:24.310 --> 05:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
1359 which is a
 
05:35:27.190 --> 05:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh bipartisan bill as you will see by
 
05:35:29.430 --> 05:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsors it also is missing a couple
 
05:35:32.350 --> 05:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor ERS um the day before the
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
deadline we had still not received this
 
05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
back and when I contacted
 
05:35:43.110 --> 05:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
OS um I was told it had been sent to me
 
05:35:44.788 --> 05:35:44.798 align:start position:0%
well it actually went to the other
 
05:35:47.190 --> 05:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative turot so it was a
 
05:35:50.030 --> 05:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
scramble to get the individuals on here
 
05:35:51.390 --> 05:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
uh there were two other individuals in
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
this room who are originally supposed to
 
05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
be on the
 
05:35:59.070 --> 05:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
bill there are I was asked uh first
 
05:36:02.190 --> 05:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
contacted by the New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
Association for the bill I am expecting
 
05:36:09.430 --> 05:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
them the Bia some home builders uh that
 
05:36:13.230 --> 05:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
will also uh be testifying in support of
 
05:36:16.030 --> 05:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
this bill there are two parts to it I'll
 
05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
start with the first one the first part
 
05:36:23.190 --> 05:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
if you look on page one of the bill on
 
05:36:25.070 --> 05:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
lines three and
 
05:36:30.110 --> 05:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
four it removes the term or sent uh
 
05:36:33.830 --> 05:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
three words any person AG reeved which
 
05:36:37.270 --> 05:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
is Broad by any uh
 
05:36:40.510 --> 05:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
definition and replaces it with the
 
05:36:45.190 --> 05:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
applicant and a butter as defined in 62
 
05:36:48.788 --> 05:36:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh 7 672 colon 3 we'll talk about that
 
05:36:52.230 --> 05:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
one in a little little more detail in a
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
second the
 
05:36:56.708 --> 05:36:56.718 align:start position:0%
other one that is changed is on that
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
same page line
 
05:37:02.350 --> 05:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
16 and the wording any person directly
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
affected thereby is replaced with an
 
05:37:07.470 --> 05:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
abutter as defined in the RSA which
 
05:37:09.230 --> 05:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about in a minute both of
 
05:37:11.390 --> 05:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
those terms are very vague uh there were
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of uh court cases that you will
 
05:37:17.310 --> 05:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
hear about from others
 
05:37:19.910 --> 05:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
um is really the main one of the main
 
05:37:24.030 --> 05:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:27.390 --> 05:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
here so as
 
05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
written the reason I believe it's too
 
05:37:33.990 --> 05:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
vague and let's go back to line three
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
and four any person AG greev so I live
 
05:37:39.070 --> 05:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
in the town of barington I live on the
 
05:37:40.670 --> 05:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
Southeast side of barington the other
 
05:37:43.030 --> 05:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
side of barington is about eight miles
 
05:37:47.590 --> 05:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
away what is any person AG
 
05:37:49.830 --> 05:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
grieved can somebody on the other side
 
05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
of barington create an excuse as to why
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
he's AG grieved by what I may be doing
 
05:37:56.750 --> 05:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
on my
 
05:38:00.110 --> 05:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
property um I I think under the current
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
language that can be made now remember
 
05:38:06.750 --> 05:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
this these are these are rights um to
 
05:38:08.990 --> 05:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
the appeal of the board of adjustment
 
05:38:11.548 --> 05:38:11.558 align:start position:0%
this isn't this isn't going to change
 
05:38:12.910 --> 05:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
how people are
 
05:38:15.190 --> 05:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
notified um it's not going to prevent
 
05:38:17.390 --> 05:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
them from speaking at a hearing it's
 
05:38:19.948 --> 05:38:19.958 align:start position:0%
only going to be uh change the
 
05:38:21.670 --> 05:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
individuals who can
 
05:38:24.628 --> 05:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
apply uh for the appeal to the board of
 
05:38:26.750 --> 05:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment or the motion of re-hearing
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
in the second
 
05:38:28.520 --> 05:38:32.708 align:start position:0%
in the second
case

05:38:32.708 --> 05:38:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:35.310 --> 05:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
the second part now when that was
 
05:38:37.468 --> 05:38:37.478 align:start position:0%
brought to me and I was reviewing a
 
05:38:38.788 --> 05:38:38.798 align:start position:0%
couple of the cases that you will
 
05:38:40.670 --> 05:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
probably hear about one was in seabook
 
05:38:42.510 --> 05:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
and one was in the town of
 
05:38:46.350 --> 05:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
Dover um by changing the first part to a
 
05:38:49.548 --> 05:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
butter I went of course to the 672 colon
 
05:38:53.590 --> 05:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
3 um definition of a a
 
05:38:57.868 --> 05:38:57.878 align:start position:0%
butter in one of the cases it spoke to
 
05:39:00.430 --> 05:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
being um
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
the current language where it says
 
05:39:03.628 --> 05:39:03.638 align:start position:0%
directly across the street of stream
 
05:39:05.948 --> 05:39:05.958 align:start position:0%
from and and one of the cases hinged on
 
05:39:08.468 --> 05:39:08.478 align:start position:0%
the definition of being of of exactly
 
05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
that and that was they were claiming
 
05:39:13.230 --> 05:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
directly included
 
05:39:15.868 --> 05:39:15.878 align:start position:0%
diagonally so as I started looking at
 
05:39:18.310 --> 05:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
that I tried to come up with a little
 
05:39:20.910 --> 05:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
bit of clarifying language of what is
 
05:39:24.708 --> 05:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
exactly across the street or stream
 
05:39:27.390 --> 05:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
mean we went through all kinds of
 
05:39:29.468 --> 05:39:29.478 align:start position:0%
iterations and none of them really
 
05:39:32.150 --> 05:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
worked very well now when you read
 
05:39:34.230 --> 05:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
what's in there now starting on line
 
05:39:37.110 --> 05:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
five it may sound confusing but it's
 
05:39:39.670 --> 05:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
actually very very
 
05:39:43.868 --> 05:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
definitive and simply what it says is
 
05:39:47.390 --> 05:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I had planned to actually draw up
 
05:39:49.510 --> 05:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
some examples and I will do that for
 
05:39:52.110 --> 05:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
anybody who would like to see them later
 
05:39:54.150 --> 05:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
but basically what it says is take a
 
05:39:56.948 --> 05:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
simp simplistic
 
05:39:59.948 --> 05:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
case I was recently down in Salem the
 
05:40:01.708 --> 05:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
town of Salem on the main Dragon it was
 
05:40:05.868 --> 05:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
an extremely wide road so if you had a
 
05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
parcel a square parcel on one side of
 
05:40:08.080 --> 05:40:09.390 align:start position:0%
parcel a square parcel on one side of
that

05:40:09.390 --> 05:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:40:12.670 --> 05:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
road using this definition directly
 
05:40:15.510 --> 05:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
across the street of
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
stream you go to the edges of the
 
05:40:20.708 --> 05:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
property you draw a line perpendicular
 
05:40:22.070 --> 05:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
across the
 
05:40:25.868 --> 05:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
street any point that falls between
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
those two lines you're in a butter and
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
50 feet on either side of those lines
 
05:40:33.990 --> 05:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
you're in a butter now that only applies
 
05:40:36.070 --> 05:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
to across the street or
 
05:40:39.468 --> 05:40:39.478 align:start position:0%
stream uh when we were developing this
 
05:40:42.468 --> 05:40:42.478 align:start position:0%
language rep Uh current chairman power
 
05:40:46.628 --> 05:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
and I discussed uh other um
 
05:40:50.548 --> 05:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
potential uh properties with uh you know
 
05:40:54.670 --> 05:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
50 foot rways in or entryways and
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
different things and we finally got it
 
05:40:59.830 --> 05:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
to this definition um
 
05:41:02.430 --> 05:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
which I think covers just about any
 
05:41:04.510 --> 05:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
instance you can you know other other
 
05:41:06.190 --> 05:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
issues that were brought up was okay
 
05:41:08.910 --> 05:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
well why not diagonally across well take
 
05:41:13.390 --> 05:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
Salem that was a a good is a good
 
05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
example if you took and Drew a diagonal
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
from the the point on one side of the
 
05:41:24.150 --> 05:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
that six Lane Street or whatever it is
 
05:41:26.948 --> 05:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
down there in Salem and when diagonally
 
05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
you could C
 
05:41:31.788 --> 05:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
capture a property hundreds and hundreds
 
05:41:34.350 --> 05:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
of feet down the street depending what
 
05:41:36.510 --> 05:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
your definition of diagonal is is
 
05:41:41.150 --> 05:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
diagonal 90° is it 60° is it 2 Dees so
 
05:41:43.868 --> 05:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
we we eliminated the diagonal we also
 
05:41:46.030 --> 05:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
talked about radi uh
 
05:41:49.590 --> 05:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
radius radius from where that was a very
 
05:41:52.990 --> 05:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
difficult one to do so by adding simply
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
this this definition of what across the
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
street of stream means in addition
 
05:42:03.390 --> 05:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
what's already there we thought that was
 
05:42:06.670 --> 05:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh more than adequate
 
05:42:09.468 --> 05:42:09.478 align:start position:0%
to accomplish what we were trying to do
 
05:42:10.948 --> 05:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
so again like I said we have other
 
05:42:12.350 --> 05:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
people I know who are going to speak on
 
05:42:15.510 --> 05:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
this that may or may not be more
 
05:42:18.270 --> 05:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
um well spoken or

05:42:25.750 --> 05:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
these um Supreme Court decisions that
 
05:42:28.868 --> 05:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
were done but I would certainly be open
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%

05:42:34.830 --> 05:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative turot are

sponsor representative Guthrie thank you

madam chair and thank you for your
 
05:42:46.788 --> 05:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
testimony I just have a quick question
 
05:42:49.390 --> 05:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
and it's because it's I don't understand
 
05:42:52.230 --> 05:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
what's going on here are you looking to
 
05:42:54.948 --> 05:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
include more and butters or limit the
 
05:42:58.190 --> 05:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
amount of Butters who will will have uh
 
05:43:00.510 --> 05:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
some justification should for be before
 
05:43:04.548 --> 05:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the ab betters I mean the
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
board of adjustment excellent question
 
05:43:09.788 --> 05:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to eliminate or
 
05:43:11.990 --> 05:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
increase the number of abutters what
 
05:43:13.868 --> 05:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is Define the
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
abutters more
 
05:43:19.310 --> 05:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
specifically um and at the same time for
 
05:43:23.270 --> 05:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
the purposes of appeals and
 
05:43:25.110 --> 05:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
rearings to
 
05:43:27.868 --> 05:43:27.878 align:start position:0%
eliminate the terms any person AG
 
05:43:29.868 --> 05:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
grieved which is
 
05:43:32.910 --> 05:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
very broad as well as any person
 
05:43:36.390 --> 05:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
directly affected thereby by making it
 
05:43:38.708 --> 05:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
specific to the abutters and in
 
05:43:40.310 --> 05:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
including a new definition in the
 
05:43:42.948 --> 05:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
abutter followup Madam chair if I
 
05:43:46.070 --> 05:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
may yes when you're referred I I didn't
 
05:43:48.910 --> 05:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
look up the RSA so you can save me a lot
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
of time when we're talking about the
 
05:43:53.868 --> 05:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
board of adjustments we're not talking
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
about the local Board of adjustment as
 
05:43:59.548 --> 05:43:59.558 align:start position:0%
we know it we're talking about a another
 
05:44:01.190 --> 05:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
appeals board is that
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
correct as far I I have mentioned this
 
05:44:07.190 --> 05:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
to many people I Am brand new to the
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
municipal and County realm if you will
 
05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
I've been on labor and other committees
 
05:44:16.030 --> 05:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
for years um alls I can talk to is this
 
05:44:19.548 --> 05:44:19.558 align:start position:0%
one is rights to appeal of the board of
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
adjustment and it's RSA
 
05:44:25.030 --> 05:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
676 colon five I'm sure somebody else in
 
05:44:27.830 --> 05:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
back would be way better at answering
 
05:44:31.390 --> 05:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
that I wasn't clear I meant the town
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
Board of adjustment versus another Board
 
05:44:33.840 --> 05:44:35.910 align:start position:0%
Board of adjustment versus another Board
of

05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:44:37.868 --> 05:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
adjustment which is
 
05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
it it's the one in 676 colon
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
5 no wonder you're chairman Mr chairman
 
05:44:45.240 --> 05:44:46.750 align:start position:0%
5 no wonder you're chairman Mr chairman
thank

05:44:46.750 --> 05:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:44:50.110 --> 05:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
05:44:52.230 --> 05:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:44:53.390 --> 05:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
05:44:54.990 --> 05:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
question which may may be getting down
 
05:44:57.150 --> 05:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
to the weeds but but I'll but I'll get
 
05:44:58.670 --> 05:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
to the salian point of the question I'm
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
only thinking from years on the planning
 
05:45:03.110 --> 05:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
board where people read every word and
 
05:45:05.468 --> 05:45:05.478 align:start position:0%
then and then try to find the the oops
 
05:45:08.310 --> 05:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
of the loophole um and I'm thinking
 
05:45:10.070 --> 05:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
specifically in the town of Northampton
 
05:45:11.750 --> 05:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
we have minor sight plan review if a
 
05:45:13.230 --> 05:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
site plan already exists and they want
 
05:45:16.750 --> 05:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
to do a minor sight plan years later
 
05:45:20.628 --> 05:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
that um that they may do that
 
05:45:25.468 --> 05:45:25.478 align:start position:0%
um what happens if the grieved
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
party is contesting the boundary lines
 
05:45:33.230 --> 05:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
would what where would the appeal go if
 
05:45:36.670 --> 05:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
you are contesting the boundary lines
 
05:45:38.590 --> 05:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
excellent question that I have no answer
 
05:45:40.708 --> 05:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
for I do not know the answer to that
 
05:45:43.310 --> 05:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
okay well again maybe somebody behind me
 
05:45:45.390 --> 05:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
for that thanks I'd love to answer it
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
but I I don't know the
 
05:45:49.390 --> 05:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
answer further
 
05:45:52.030 --> 05:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Tetra was your
 
05:45:55.350 --> 05:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
hand up previously okay representative
 
05:45:57.468 --> 05:45:57.478 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
05:46:02.628 --> 05:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
um I also have a problem with the any
 
05:46:06.030 --> 05:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
person grieved um only and I understand
 
05:46:10.430 --> 05:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's a catch all which is good uh
 
05:46:12.948 --> 05:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
but you need the catch all because you
 
05:46:16.230 --> 05:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
don't do you know it what happens
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
when uh property is owned jointly and
 
05:46:21.990 --> 05:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
one of the property owners decides to
 
05:46:24.628 --> 05:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
tear down a barn and the other property
 
05:46:29.150 --> 05:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
owner is is uh upset about that they may
 
05:46:32.628 --> 05:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
go to the zoning board to solve their
 
05:46:34.150 --> 05:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
problem because it's
 
05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
a piece of property that that's allowed
 
05:46:40.590 --> 05:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
but not wanted by
 
05:46:44.030 --> 05:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
both it's not a good example but um I'm
 
05:46:45.390 --> 05:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
just saying
 
05:46:48.270 --> 05:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
when there are situations that sounds to
 
05:46:50.468 --> 05:46:50.478 align:start position:0%
me if if that's a question for me it
 
05:46:53.548 --> 05:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
sounds to me more like a civil civil
 
05:46:57.948 --> 05:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
action or a deed action rather than
 
05:47:00.270 --> 05:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
something that would app app to this in
 
05:47:00.280 --> 05:47:02.468 align:start position:0%
something that would app app to this in
my

05:47:02.468 --> 05:47:02.478 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:47:05.788 --> 05:47:05.798 align:start position:0%
opinion representative Brown thank you
 
05:47:08.190 --> 05:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
madam Vice chair
 
05:47:11.390 --> 05:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh so the question is in regard to your
 
05:47:13.150 --> 05:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
perpendicular line so let's say this is
 
05:47:15.750 --> 05:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
a polygon a hexagon something like that
 
05:47:18.830 --> 05:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
so those perpendicular lines are drawn
 
05:47:21.390 --> 05:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever adjacent Corner points
 
05:47:23.390 --> 05:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
they are is that correct that's correct
 
05:47:23.400 --> 05:47:25.868 align:start position:0%
they are is that correct that's correct
thank

05:47:25.868 --> 05:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:31.310 --> 05:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
seeing I have a
 
05:47:37.868 --> 05:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
question so um I too am concerned with
 
05:47:41.948 --> 05:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
the Striking of the in line three any
 
05:47:44.910 --> 05:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
person AG reeved as well as in line 16
 
05:47:47.830 --> 05:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
any person directly affected thereby and
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
the concern that I have is that there
 
05:47:55.350 --> 05:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
could be um a project in town which
 
05:47:55.360 --> 05:47:56.270 align:start position:0%
could be um a project in town which
would

05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:47:59.230 --> 05:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
affect people within that
 
05:48:01.390 --> 05:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
municipality that are not directly AB
 
05:48:03.070 --> 05:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
butters for example if a neighborhood
 
05:48:06.070 --> 05:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
were going to be put in and there's
 
05:48:09.708 --> 05:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
concerns with the majority of our um
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
houses here in New Hampshire are on
 
05:48:15.070 --> 05:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
Wells private Wells so something like
 
05:48:16.990 --> 05:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
that would would affect people who are
 
05:48:20.628 --> 05:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
not directly Butters who their Wells
 
05:48:23.788 --> 05:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
they draw water from an aquafer an
 
05:48:26.230 --> 05:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
underground natural aquafer would you be
 
05:48:28.190 --> 05:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
open to an amendment that would
 
05:48:28.200 --> 05:48:29.788 align:start position:0%
open to an amendment that would
accommodate

05:48:29.788 --> 05:48:29.798 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
05:48:36.150 --> 05:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
um that would eliminate the overly broad
 
05:48:43.110 --> 05:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
language that exists now um if it were
 
05:48:43.120 --> 05:48:44.750 align:start position:0%
language that exists now um if it were
something

05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:48:47.830 --> 05:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
specific I would be potentially open to
 
05:48:50.868 --> 05:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
05:48:53.190 --> 05:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:48:55.390 --> 05:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
K thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:49:01.670 --> 05:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
was there was some construction going on
 
05:49:06.990 --> 05:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
in Hampton not too long ago a couple
 
05:49:10.590 --> 05:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
years ago where this object was being
 
05:49:13.788 --> 05:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
put up that um reflected the sun in a in
 
05:49:17.468 --> 05:49:17.478 align:start position:0%
a in a way and the the people that were
 
05:49:20.708 --> 05:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
being affected by that item weren't AB
 
05:49:23.548 --> 05:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
Butters they were like pretty far
 
05:49:26.350 --> 05:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
away so do you would you believe that
 
05:49:29.468 --> 05:49:29.478 align:start position:0%
maybe this language exists to protect
 
05:49:32.468 --> 05:49:32.478 align:start position:0%
people like that well what I would say
 
05:49:36.230 --> 05:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
is that there's nothing that prevents
 
05:49:36.240 --> 05:49:36.990 align:start position:0%
is that there's nothing that prevents
the

05:49:36.990 --> 05:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:49:38.990 --> 05:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
individuals I would imagine that would
 
05:49:41.548 --> 05:49:41.558 align:start position:0%
come up at an
 
05:49:45.230 --> 05:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
initial um hearing or whatever uh
 
05:49:47.468 --> 05:49:47.478 align:start position:0%
initial Hearing in the town there's
 
05:49:49.670 --> 05:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
nothing that prevents individuals from
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
testifying there's nothing that prevents
 
05:49:55.110 --> 05:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
as we'll go in line four an officer
 
05:49:56.910 --> 05:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
department head board Bureau of
 
05:49:59.350 --> 05:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal there's nothing that prevents
 
05:50:03.270 --> 05:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
them from doing the the appeal again
 
05:50:06.390 --> 05:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
what this is trying to do is eliminate
 
05:50:08.830 --> 05:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
the overly
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
broad language that could apply to just
 
05:50:15.390 --> 05:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
about anything uh representative power
 
05:50:18.230 --> 05:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned um you know open
 
05:50:21.548 --> 05:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
to um you know an amendment if it's
 
05:50:23.788 --> 05:50:23.798 align:start position:0%
something that's specific I I'm not
 
05:50:27.030 --> 05:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to that what what the reason for
 
05:50:29.030 --> 05:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
this language is to get rid rid of this
 
05:50:34.590 --> 05:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:36.830 --> 05:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
language representative
 
05:50:38.948 --> 05:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:50:41.910 --> 05:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um this
 
05:50:44.708 --> 05:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill seeks to seeks to it
 
05:50:47.868 --> 05:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
references 672 colon
 
05:50:50.708 --> 05:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
3 and I'm looking for a kind of happy
 
05:50:53.390 --> 05:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
medium between the any person AG grieved
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the more specific language which I
 
05:51:00.190 --> 05:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
support but 672 three actually has a
 
05:51:03.628 --> 05:51:03.638 align:start position:0%
little bit more expansive language than
 
05:51:05.868 --> 05:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
what is proposed in your bill because it
 
05:51:08.030 --> 05:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
says shall include any person who is
 
05:51:11.548 --> 05:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
able to demonstrate that his land will
 
05:51:13.590 --> 05:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
be directly affected by the proposal
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
under consideration would you be
 
05:51:19.190 --> 05:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
amendable to including that language as
 
05:51:19.200 --> 05:51:20.590 align:start position:0%
amendable to including that language as
an

05:51:20.590 --> 05:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:51:23.350 --> 05:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
amendment um I'm looking at
 
05:51:26.468 --> 05:51:26.478 align:start position:0%
6723 the definition of a
 
05:51:29.310 --> 05:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
butter I don't see that language that
 
05:51:31.590 --> 05:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
you just read I'm I'm reading it
 
05:51:35.788 --> 05:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:39.030 --> 05:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
RSA the definition of a butter oh yes I
 
05:51:41.150 --> 05:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
do see
 
05:51:44.030 --> 05:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
that but what it says is for the for the
 
05:51:47.190 --> 05:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
testm only only and not for the purposes
 
05:51:47.200 --> 05:51:48.708 align:start position:0%
testm only only and not for the purposes
of

05:51:48.708 --> 05:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:51:51.150 --> 05:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
notification I think it makes the the
 
05:51:53.788 --> 05:51:53.798 align:start position:0%
differentiation there
 
05:51:56.310 --> 05:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
right but that differentiation is not
 
05:51:59.628 --> 05:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
made in your bill I I couldn't hear that
 
05:52:01.310 --> 05:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
one sorry that differentiation is not
 
05:52:02.468 --> 05:52:02.478 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
05:52:05.910 --> 05:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
followup Madam yes uh I don't see that
 
05:52:08.510 --> 05:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
definition in your bill either unless
 
05:52:12.270 --> 05:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:16.948 --> 05:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
it again I'm a little confused um on the
 
05:52:18.788 --> 05:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
second page under the abutter that
 
05:52:21.628 --> 05:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
language is already
 
05:52:26.230 --> 05:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:29.830 --> 05:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
change thank you
 
05:52:33.948 --> 05:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
05:52:36.990 --> 05:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none thank you thank you
 
05:52:37.000 --> 05:52:39.830 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none thank you thank you
madam

05:52:39.830 --> 05:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:44.628 --> 05:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
chair so next I have Mr David juv who
 
05:52:50.310 --> 05:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:55.590 --> 05:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
bill I fromp Association he's going to
 
05:52:57.670 --> 05:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
be talking a lot of things that I'd like
 
05:52:57.680 --> 05:52:59.030 align:start position:0%
be talking a lot of things that I'd like
to

05:52:59.030 --> 05:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:53:00.830 --> 05:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
so you would like to wave off your
 
05:53:07.510 --> 05:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:11.070 --> 05:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
appear okay that'll be
 
05:53:14.708 --> 05:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
fine so next I will call Mr n Grace from
 
05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
05:53:19.150 --> 05:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
he's here to testify in support of the
 
05:53:22.910 --> 05:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
handout thank you madam chair n Grace
 
05:53:26.990 --> 05:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
for the municipal Association we do
 
05:53:28.708 --> 05:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
05:53:32.868 --> 05:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to explain briefly um I
 
05:53:35.110 --> 05:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
do have a handout that explains kind of
 
05:53:38.270 --> 05:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
the origination of uh the ideas behind
 
05:53:41.270 --> 05:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
this bill it marries two different
 
05:53:44.350 --> 05:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
things um so first I'll start with the
 
05:53:46.708 --> 05:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
definition of a butter I will admit to
 
05:53:49.788 --> 05:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
all of you that I am not an engineer but
 
05:53:52.868 --> 05:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh I understand that the chair has
 
05:53:55.948 --> 05:53:55.958 align:start position:0%
training as an engineer and uh and did
 
05:53:57.708 --> 05:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
some drawings for me that made a lot of
 
05:53:57.718 --> 05:53:59.110 align:start position:0%
some drawings for me that made a lot of
sense

05:53:59.110 --> 05:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
sense
 
05:54:04.948 --> 05:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
um so a couple years ago um back in 2021
 
05:54:06.548 --> 05:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
this the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
05:54:09.990 --> 05:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
decided the SE Brook onetop case in that
 
05:54:12.990 --> 05:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
case uh they determined that the current
 
05:54:14.868 --> 05:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
definition of a butter does not include
 
05:54:18.430 --> 05:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
properties that are diagonal um in going
 
05:54:20.270 --> 05:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
in which doesn't make a whole lot of
 
05:54:21.948 --> 05:54:21.958 align:start position:0%
sense when you think about it because
 
05:54:24.110 --> 05:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
that means that the table that's
 
05:54:26.110 --> 05:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
diagonally from my property here this
 
05:54:29.150 --> 05:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
table is not in a butter even though it
 
05:54:34.030 --> 05:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
would logically touch um so the language
 
05:54:38.430 --> 05:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
on page page two would seek to uh alter
 
05:54:41.468 --> 05:54:41.478 align:start position:0%
that to include those properties as well
 
05:54:44.350 --> 05:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
as other relevant properties that may
 
05:54:47.990 --> 05:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
not be captured by the current vague
 
05:54:49.990 --> 05:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
definition the second thing that the
 
05:54:53.310 --> 05:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
bill does is the changes to the any
 
05:54:55.910 --> 05:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
person aggrieved uh any person directly
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
affected language um to change that to
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
the applicant and a butter or uh the
 
05:55:04.080 --> 05:55:06.070 align:start position:0%
the applicant and a butter or uh the
municipality

05:55:06.070 --> 05:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
05:55:08.910 --> 05:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason for that is over
 
05:55:11.070 --> 05:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
the course of the spring and summer
 
05:55:12.788 --> 05:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
there was a special committee on housing
 
05:55:12.798 --> 05:55:13.628 align:start position:0%
there was a special committee on housing
that

05:55:13.628 --> 05:55:13.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:55:17.750 --> 05:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
investigated um some of the concerns
 
05:55:21.670 --> 05:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
with uh let's say a dir of of housing in
 
05:55:25.670 --> 05:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
our state um and one of the things that
 
05:55:28.510 --> 05:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
was discovered during that process was
 
05:55:30.788 --> 05:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
that uh back in the
 
05:55:33.708 --> 05:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
1970s there were what are frequently
 
05:55:36.230 --> 05:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
termed as starter homes small homes or
 
05:55:38.110 --> 05:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
affordable homes that is homes less than
 
05:55:40.590 --> 05:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
1,400 Square ft that were built that
 
05:55:42.270 --> 05:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
were about a quarter of the number of
 
05:55:46.590 --> 05:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
houses built um for a number of reasons
 
05:55:49.110 --> 05:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
those have become not very economical to
 
05:55:53.510 --> 05:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
build and as of um about 2010 there less
 
05:55:56.430 --> 05:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
than 10% of the houses built given our
 
05:55:59.070 --> 05:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
current housing situation the market
 
05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
would dictate that those are the kind of
 
05:56:03.670 --> 05:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
houses that firsttime home buyers are
 
05:56:07.030 --> 05:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
looking for so one of the questions that
 
05:56:10.430 --> 05:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
arose was well what policy conditions
 
05:56:13.030 --> 05:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
existed in the 1970s that were then
 
05:56:16.708 --> 05:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
changed that may have affected this type
 
05:56:18.910 --> 05:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
of building and one of the things we
 
05:56:21.310 --> 05:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
were able to identify was that the
 
05:56:25.270 --> 05:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
legislature changed the statute um for
 
05:56:28.270 --> 05:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
who has the ability to appeal a local
 
05:56:29.830 --> 05:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
land use board
 
05:56:31.910 --> 05:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
decision and instead of saying what it
 
05:56:34.070 --> 05:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
used to say it broaden the language to
 
05:56:35.590 --> 05:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
say any person AG
 
05:56:39.390 --> 05:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
grieved and in development time is money
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
and so the longer a project takes the
 
05:56:43.548 --> 05:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
more money that the developer has to lay
 
05:56:45.270 --> 05:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
out for it the less economical it
 
05:56:46.948 --> 05:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
becomes the less likely it is they're
 
05:56:48.948 --> 05:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
going to build that small starter home
 
05:56:50.548 --> 05:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
that we're hoping for them to
 
05:56:54.590 --> 05:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
build so in looking at
 
05:56:59.070 --> 05:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
the statutes back in the 1970s one of
 
05:57:01.910 --> 05:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
the what I'm going to call obvious um
 
05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
changes was to change the um any person
 
05:57:08.390 --> 05:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
AG grieve to back to what it had been
 
05:57:10.788 --> 05:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
before because when that was challenged
 
05:57:12.310 --> 05:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire Supreme Court back
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
in the 70s the Supreme Court created a
 
05:57:18.430 --> 05:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
four-part test and one part of that test
 
05:57:18.440 --> 05:57:19.628 align:start position:0%
four-part test and one part of that test
um

05:57:19.628 --> 05:57:19.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:23.310 --> 05:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
essentially allowed someone to who was
 
05:57:27.150 --> 05:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
not directly affected by the applicant
 
05:57:30.868 --> 05:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
property but was just someone out there
 
05:57:35.150 --> 05:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
in town to start the process of delaying
 
05:57:37.708 --> 05:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
that project going forward and as I said
 
05:57:39.708 --> 05:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
time is money so even though they were
 
05:57:42.310 --> 05:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
not going to win that case even though
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
eventually it would get kicked out of
 
05:57:47.510 --> 05:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
court it was costly enough that the
 
05:57:49.590 --> 05:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
developer was no it was no longer
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
possible for the developer to build what
 
05:57:54.270 --> 05:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
they were hoping to build which
 
05:57:56.750 --> 05:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is often these small
 
05:57:58.310 --> 05:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
starter homes
 
05:58:00.830 --> 05:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
so we have quite a coalition of
 
05:58:02.830 --> 05:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
supporters behind this legislation
 
05:58:05.430 --> 05:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
because we think it will Target what we
 
05:58:08.030 --> 05:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
want to Target in the state which is
 
05:58:10.628 --> 05:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
development of these small homes that
 
05:58:13.430 --> 05:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
are affordable to the average person the
 
05:58:16.070 --> 05:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
average family and we'll see more of
 
05:58:18.628 --> 05:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
those built if this bill passes I'm
 
05:58:19.910 --> 05:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions the
 
05:58:20.948 --> 05:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
committee may
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
have other there any questions for Mr
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
Grace representative
 
05:58:26.718 --> 05:58:29.110 align:start position:0%
Grace representative
lales

05:58:29.110 --> 05:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
lales
 
05:58:32.350 --> 05:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:58:37.110 --> 05:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I'm not making the Nexus
 
05:58:38.990 --> 05:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
between the
 
05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
bill and additional starter homes could
 
05:58:45.310 --> 05:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
you put that and i' I've read through
 
05:58:45.320 --> 05:58:46.350 align:start position:0%
you put that and i' I've read through
your

05:58:46.350 --> 05:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:58:49.070 --> 05:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I just don't I don't see
 
05:58:49.080 --> 05:58:50.230 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I just don't I don't see
the

05:58:50.230 --> 05:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:58:50.240 --> 05:58:52.510 align:start position:0%
the
connection

05:58:52.510 --> 05:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
connection
 
05:58:54.830 --> 05:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
so there are people
 
05:58:57.390 --> 05:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
who don't like development of small
 
05:59:00.830 --> 05:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
homes homes because they often occur in
 
05:59:05.990 --> 05:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh small developments um and uh and one
 
05:59:06.000 --> 05:59:08.310 align:start position:0%
uh small developments um and uh and one
of

05:59:08.310 --> 05:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:11.430 --> 05:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
the tactics that they've used to delay
 
05:59:13.788 --> 05:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
the development is
 
05:59:17.430 --> 05:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
to use the Ability created by the
 
05:59:19.310 --> 05:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in response to the
 
05:59:21.468 --> 05:59:21.478 align:start position:0%
legislative changes back in the
 
05:59:25.510 --> 05:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
1970s to start a court process that they
 
05:59:28.670 --> 05:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
cannot win that is not
 
05:59:31.750 --> 05:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
not that would delay the project going
 
05:59:33.430 --> 05:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
forward even though the project is
 
05:59:36.030 --> 05:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
lawful under the then existing the
 
05:59:36.040 --> 05:59:37.468 align:start position:0%
lawful under the then existing the
current

05:59:37.468 --> 05:59:37.478 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:59:40.468 --> 05:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
zoning and as a consequence when
 
05:59:42.390 --> 05:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
developers go out to look at what
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to build in the first
 
05:59:46.670 --> 05:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
place they're not going to look at these
 
05:59:49.230 --> 05:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
small homes which often don't bring them
 
05:59:51.350 --> 05:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
in a lot of profit they're going to look
 
05:59:53.430 --> 05:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
at what if I look at something bigger
 
05:59:55.628 --> 05:59:55.638 align:start position:0%
that has a bigger profit margin I can
 
05:59:57.830 --> 05:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
build that because even if someone says
 
05:59:59.948 --> 05:59:59.958 align:start position:0%
I don't like this and they delay the
 
06:00:04.270 --> 06:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
process I can recoup still some profit
 
06:00:06.750 --> 06:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
whereas in this case in the cases of
 
06:00:09.150 --> 06:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
these types of homes you often see it's
 
06:00:11.910 --> 06:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
such a small profit per home that any
 
06:00:14.510 --> 06:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
delay is effectively kills the the the
 
06:00:19.750 --> 06:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:22.948 --> 06:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
you representative major thank you
 
06:00:24.590 --> 06:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
Madame chair and thank you Mr Grace for
 
06:00:27.110 --> 06:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um your organization
 
06:00:29.910 --> 06:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
represent present all 234 organized and
 
06:00:31.868 --> 06:00:31.878 align:start position:0%
Incorporated communities within the
 
06:00:34.190 --> 06:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire many of those are
 
06:00:36.190 --> 06:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
not here right now because they have
 
06:00:37.430 --> 06:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
other things that they have to do will
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
you be able to go back to the board of
 
06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
directors um and say if this bill passes
 
06:00:46.830 --> 06:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
that this will be a benefit to um all of
 
06:00:48.548 --> 06:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
those communities that have zoning
 
06:00:51.468 --> 06:00:51.478 align:start position:0%
boards uh in in in the state of New
 
06:00:54.030 --> 06:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes and one of the things that
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
we frequently see is that
 
06:00:56.440 --> 06:00:58.070 align:start position:0%
we frequently see is that
municipalities

06:00:58.070 --> 06:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:01:01.350 --> 06:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
are targeted in the newspaper as the
 
06:01:03.468 --> 06:01:03.478 align:start position:0%
ones at fault for delays of these types
 
06:01:07.150 --> 06:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
of projects even though our boards
 
06:01:08.830 --> 06:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
approved them because they were legal
 
06:01:13.390 --> 06:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:15.990 --> 06:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances representative
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman um Madam
 
06:01:21.590 --> 06:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh for taking my question and
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um again as an
 
06:01:28.070 --> 06:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
professional attorney does doesn't this
 
06:01:31.390 --> 06:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
clarify the whole confusion of what and
 
06:01:33.868 --> 06:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
ab butter is when they're approaching
 
06:01:36.670 --> 06:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
the appeal process absolutely I think it
 
06:01:38.948 --> 06:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
makes it very clear I don't think there
 
06:01:40.628 --> 06:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
will be the type of confusion that we
 
06:01:40.638 --> 06:01:42.548 align:start position:0%
will be the type of confusion that we
currently

06:01:42.548 --> 06:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:01:44.990 --> 06:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
06:01:47.110 --> 06:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you madam chair and thank
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm going to
 
06:01:52.190 --> 06:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
go back to my question to the sponsor
 
06:01:52.200 --> 06:01:53.670 align:start position:0%
go back to my question to the sponsor
about

06:01:53.670 --> 06:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:01:57.750 --> 06:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
6723 and ask you this same question if
 
06:02:01.590 --> 06:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
the bill is attempting to clarify the
 
06:02:04.788 --> 06:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
language in the current
 
06:02:07.670 --> 06:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
statute speed up the process for
 
06:02:09.948 --> 06:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
developers hopefully encourage the
 
06:02:13.030 --> 06:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
building of more affordable housing does
 
06:02:15.150 --> 06:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
the definition of a butter as it
 
06:02:17.670 --> 06:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
currently stands in
 
06:02:20.990 --> 06:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
6723 is that at odds with what this bill
 
06:02:23.708 --> 06:02:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
do I don't think so because it this bill
 
06:02:30.150 --> 06:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
simply inserts a new sentence into the
 
06:02:31.788 --> 06:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
definition it doesn't delete anything
 
06:02:34.788 --> 06:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
from the definition um and that
 
06:02:39.390 --> 06:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
sentence in in my in my non engineering
 
06:02:42.030 --> 06:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
parlament includes those diagonal
 
06:02:43.548 --> 06:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
properties that we kind of logically
 
06:02:45.910 --> 06:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
assume or included as well so it doesn't
 
06:02:50.830 --> 06:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
really change um that direct effect from
 
06:02:53.190 --> 06:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
um one property to the other that would
 
06:02:55.110 --> 06:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
that would be that standing argument
 
06:02:57.788 --> 06:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
there follow up thank thank you madam
 
06:02:57.798 --> 06:02:59.910 align:start position:0%
there follow up thank thank you madam
chair

06:02:59.910 --> 06:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:03:03.548 --> 06:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
so the definition in 6723 as it reads
 
06:03:05.910 --> 06:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
now shall include any person who is able
 
06:03:07.868 --> 06:03:07.878 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that his land will be
 
06:03:10.628 --> 06:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
directly affected by the
 
06:03:14.750 --> 06:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
proposal that to me seems similarly
 
06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
vague in that it it doesn't reach the
 
06:03:21.150 --> 06:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
specificity that this bill proposes and
 
06:03:24.350 --> 06:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
I just worry that the current definition
 
06:03:24.360 --> 06:03:25.190 align:start position:0%
I just worry that the current definition
might

06:03:25.190 --> 06:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
might
 
06:03:28.030 --> 06:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
be do you see what I'm trying to get at
 
06:03:30.708 --> 06:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
I I do see um certainly if there's an
 
06:03:32.628 --> 06:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
amendment that you'd like to propose I'm
 
06:03:34.468 --> 06:03:34.478 align:start position:0%
happy to to work with you or any member
 
06:03:36.590 --> 06:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee on that to try to clear
 
06:03:38.150 --> 06:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
this up so we don't have any confusion
 
06:03:39.190 --> 06:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:03:41.390 --> 06:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
future are there any additional
 
06:03:43.670 --> 06:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
06:03:47.750 --> 06:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you Mr
 
06:03:52.110 --> 06:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
Grace next up I have Mr David juv
 
06:03:56.468 --> 06:03:56.478 align:start position:0%
from Bia and he is here to testify in
 
06:04:01.670 --> 06:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:03.708 --> 06:04:03.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
06:04:05.468 --> 06:04:05.478 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
06:04:07.628 --> 06:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
is Dave ju I'm a senior vice president
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
with the business and industry
 
06:04:11.788 --> 06:04:11.798 align:start position:0%
Association we serve as New Hampshire's
 
06:04:14.548 --> 06:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce not before
 
06:04:16.708 --> 06:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
this committee all that often um so I
 
06:04:18.110 --> 06:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
want to let you know a little bit about
 
06:04:21.390 --> 06:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
what Bia is we have approximately 400
 
06:04:24.270 --> 06:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
employer members and they employ over a
 
06:04:27.708 --> 06:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
100,000 Granite Staters so we do
 
06:04:29.788 --> 06:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
uh represent uh the voice of the
 
06:04:31.788 --> 06:04:31.798 align:start position:0%
business community and one of the
 
06:04:34.030 --> 06:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
concerns of the business Community for
 
06:04:37.590 --> 06:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
well over 10 years has been the lack of
 
06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh housing for employees it makes it
 
06:04:43.390 --> 06:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
difficult for employers to hire it makes
 
06:04:45.548 --> 06:04:45.558 align:start position:0%
it difficult for employers to retain
 
06:04:45.558 --> 06:04:47.830 align:start position:0%
it difficult for employers to retain
their

06:04:47.830 --> 06:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:50.590 --> 06:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
Workforce you all at this point are
 
06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
fairly familiar with with housing as an
 
06:04:55.708 --> 06:04:55.718 align:start position:0%
issue and probably recognize that it's a
 
06:04:58.070 --> 06:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
critical issue for New Hampshire it
 
06:05:00.788 --> 06:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't always that way when we first
 
06:05:03.510 --> 06:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
started working on housing issues around
 
06:05:07.468 --> 06:05:07.478 align:start position:0%
2008 people didn't really understand why
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
the Bia was working on that we thought
 
06:05:12.350 --> 06:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
we were working on issues relating to
 
06:05:15.990 --> 06:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
subsidized housing we were not um they
 
06:05:18.350 --> 06:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
thought we were working on issues to try
 
06:05:23.350 --> 06:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
and change the um process by which
 
06:05:26.510 --> 06:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
projects were approved uh and take away
 
06:05:29.230 --> 06:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
local control we were not what we were
 
06:05:32.070 --> 06:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do is educate the legislature
 
06:05:35.110 --> 06:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
on the impact that housing and
 
06:05:37.788 --> 06:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
especially the lack of housing has on
 
06:05:39.670 --> 06:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
our economy and the ability of our
 
06:05:42.468 --> 06:05:42.478 align:start position:0%
employers to hire and retain Workforce
 
06:05:46.350 --> 06:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
we're supporting this bill uh because it
 
06:05:50.670 --> 06:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
is not a um Silver Bullet we've learned
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
over the years that there is no Silver
 
06:05:54.310 --> 06:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
Bullet there are a lot of issues that
 
06:05:57.190 --> 06:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
impact why house sufficient housing
 
06:05:59.030 --> 06:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
isn't being built to meet the needs of
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
this state but it does address an
 
06:06:03.830 --> 06:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
important issue and I guess I want to
 
06:06:05.430 --> 06:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
make sure the committee clearly
 
06:06:06.948 --> 06:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
understands I think you do but I want to
 
06:06:11.070 --> 06:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
make sure you clearly understand um the
 
06:06:15.510 --> 06:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
reason I uh early on when I uh n told me
 
06:06:17.270 --> 06:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
about the legislation I expressed a
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
little bit of surprise that the
 
06:06:22.230 --> 06:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
municipal Association was
 
06:06:25.868 --> 06:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
um the author of this bill because I'll
 
06:06:29.190 --> 06:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
admit my bias I sometimes fell into that
 
06:06:32.990 --> 06:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
trap of thinking that Municipal planning
 
06:06:34.708 --> 06:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
boards and zoning boards were the
 
06:06:37.990 --> 06:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
impediment the obstacle to housing and I
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
thought that this
 
06:06:44.830 --> 06:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
might make housing projects easier to be
 
06:06:48.310 --> 06:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
completed um the response which he
 
06:06:53.628 --> 06:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
educated me on is that they work for the
 
06:06:55.270 --> 06:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh Boards of Selectmen the planning
 
06:06:56.990 --> 06:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
boards and zoning boards of all the
 
06:06:59.628 --> 06:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
communities within their membership and
 
06:07:01.468 --> 06:07:01.478 align:start position:0%
they felt this bill would be a benefit
 
06:07:04.990 --> 06:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason why is when we're talking
 
06:07:08.230 --> 06:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
about um persons
 
06:07:10.708 --> 06:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
aggrieved we have to recognize if that
 
06:07:12.788 --> 06:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
is being appealed what they're
 
06:07:17.708 --> 06:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
appealing is a um decision by the local
 
06:07:20.510 --> 06:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
planning board or zoning board after a
 
06:07:24.270 --> 06:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing and after all of the uh
 
06:07:26.910 --> 06:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
plans and evidence have been vetted to
 
06:07:29.590 --> 06:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
allow that project to move forward they
 
06:07:31.270 --> 06:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
believe it's in the best interest of the
 
06:07:33.430 --> 06:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
town for that project to move
 
06:07:36.430 --> 06:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
forward and yet an individual can slow
 
06:07:39.990 --> 06:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
that down by uh requesting an appeal of
 
06:07:42.350 --> 06:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
that decision that to me is the heart of
 
06:07:46.310 --> 06:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
what this bill is trying to reduce the
 
06:07:48.548 --> 06:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
um incidence of and it's why we support
 
06:07:50.750 --> 06:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
it be happy to answer any
 
06:07:52.910 --> 06:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions for
 
06:07:52.920 --> 06:07:54.350 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions for
this

06:07:54.350 --> 06:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:07:56.468 --> 06:07:56.478 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you for your
 
06:07:58.390 --> 06:07:58.400 align:start position:0%

06:08:06.190 --> 06:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
Ben Frost from New Hampshire housing he
 
06:08:12.910 --> 06:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:15.468 --> 06:08:15.478 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you madam chair and good
 
06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon committee members it is a uh
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
Delight to appear before you again
 
06:08:25.030 --> 06:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
especially uh a delight because I get to
 
06:08:27.468 --> 06:08:27.478 align:start position:0%
agree with the municipal Association
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
which is a a pleasant change of events
 
06:08:34.750 --> 06:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
um attorney Gray's I think really well
 
06:08:37.868 --> 06:08:37.878 align:start position:0%
outlined uh the history here uh and I
 
06:08:39.548 --> 06:08:39.558 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative turkot for
 
06:08:42.110 --> 06:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
introducing this important legislation
 
06:08:46.230 --> 06:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
this uh Returns the posture of the law
 
06:08:50.468 --> 06:08:50.478 align:start position:0%
to its a sensible place that existed in
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
the 1970s prior to the New Hampshire
 
06:08:56.510 --> 06:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's uh inexplicable decision
 
06:09:00.190 --> 06:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
in weeks versus do uh where it overruled
 
06:09:05.708 --> 06:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
itself um and seeks to limit uh who can
 
06:09:08.868 --> 06:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
appeal uh decisions of uh or who has the
 
06:09:10.910 --> 06:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
ability to appeal a decision of a zoning
 
06:09:11.830 --> 06:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
06:09:17.590 --> 06:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment um and and in so doing um
 
06:09:20.510 --> 06:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
saves municipalities in addition to it
 
06:09:22.190 --> 06:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
it's interesting I'm I'm going to argue
 
06:09:24.788 --> 06:09:24.798 align:start position:0%
for the municipalities attorney gra was
 
06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
arguing for for the affordable housing
 
06:09:28.788 --> 06:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
developers which is really just it's a
 
06:09:30.190 --> 06:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
fun place to
 
06:09:32.830 --> 06:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
be um time is money for municipalities
 
06:09:35.468 --> 06:09:35.478 align:start position:0%
too and I say this as a municipal
 
06:09:37.708 --> 06:09:37.718 align:start position:0%
official the amount of time that
 
06:09:41.110 --> 06:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities spend in court is costly
 
06:09:45.350 --> 06:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
and to the extent you as the legislature
 
06:09:48.910 --> 06:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
can reduce constrain eliminate what I
 
06:09:50.910 --> 06:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
would characterize as vexatious
 
06:09:54.110 --> 06:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
litigation litigation that has no merit
 
06:09:57.510 --> 06:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
but its only purpose is delay
 
06:10:01.110 --> 06:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
then the public is well
 
06:10:04.230 --> 06:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
served um I I'm happy to take any
 
06:10:06.350 --> 06:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions U but I think that anything
 
06:10:07.868 --> 06:10:07.878 align:start position:0%
else I might say would simply be
 
06:10:10.628 --> 06:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
repetitive of other Witnesses do any
 
06:10:14.150 --> 06:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
members have a question for Mr
 
06:10:18.430 --> 06:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
Frost seeing none thank you for your
 
06:10:22.030 --> 06:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
testimony next up I have M Alysa
 
06:10:24.468 --> 06:10:24.478 align:start position:0%
margolin from housing action New
 
06:10:26.350 --> 06:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and she is also here to
 
06:10:31.628 --> 06:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:34.030 --> 06:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you madam chair members of
 
06:10:35.590 --> 06:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
06:10:37.548 --> 06:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
Alyssa marglin and I serve as director
 
06:10:40.390 --> 06:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
of housing action New Hampshire um many
 
06:10:42.990 --> 06:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
of our members are affordable housing
 
06:10:46.190 --> 06:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
developers they're Mission oriented and
 
06:10:49.270 --> 06:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
um in recent years they've expressed a
 
06:10:51.990 --> 06:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
desire to start meeting market demand
 
06:10:55.590 --> 06:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
around starter homes they have uh often
 
06:10:57.750 --> 06:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
in their regions strong Partnerships
 
06:11:00.628 --> 06:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
with uh municipalities and they're
 
06:11:04.030 --> 06:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
essentially being asked um to to step up
 
06:11:06.350 --> 06:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
in this direction uh because of the the
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
lack of starter homes and um so uh this
 
06:11:13.110 --> 06:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
is of interest to us I I also want to
 
06:11:15.590 --> 06:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
Echo my thanks to the New Hampshire
 
06:11:18.270 --> 06:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and chairman turot
 
06:11:20.990 --> 06:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
for helping bring uh forward uh this
 
06:11:23.030 --> 06:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in the law and as was
 
06:11:25.628 --> 06:11:25.638 align:start position:0%
previously stated because it has been
 
06:11:30.868 --> 06:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
vague this tactic of delay has been um a
 
06:11:35.430 --> 06:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
frequent barrier to development and um
 
06:11:37.750 --> 06:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
and so essentially the clarification
 
06:11:40.548 --> 06:11:40.558 align:start position:0%
here and giving back the rights of
 
06:11:44.430 --> 06:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
diagonal abutters uh will um we'll
 
06:11:47.190 --> 06:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
clarify the law I think for all and then
 
06:11:50.510 --> 06:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
um stop this kind of uh bad actor
 
06:11:53.110 --> 06:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
process um our members those who are
 
06:11:55.110 --> 06:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
mission oriented and essentially
 
06:11:58.548 --> 06:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um cannot pass along the cost
 
06:12:02.910 --> 06:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
of litigation to the end user so instead
 
06:12:05.948 --> 06:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
they often decide not to build so with
 
06:12:07.548 --> 06:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
your help we'll be able to clarify the
 
06:12:11.468 --> 06:12:11.478 align:start position:0%
law um and uh and have an improved uh
 
06:12:14.590 --> 06:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
policy landscape for both municipalities
 
06:12:16.070 --> 06:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
and and those interested in meeting
 
06:12:17.750 --> 06:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing needs thank you I'm
 
06:12:20.030 --> 06:12:20.040 align:start position:0%

March 24 also known as the idilic
 
06:14:54.590 --> 06:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
Village of East
 
06:14:57.510 --> 06:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
conquered I will be brief because we are
 
06:15:00.190 --> 06:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
running late surprisingly um House Bill
 
06:15:04.390 --> 06:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
1449 seeks to clarify some ambiguity
 
06:15:07.190 --> 06:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
hoping to establish continuity regarding
 
06:15:10.230 --> 06:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
retroactive um property tax reappraisals
 
06:15:13.070 --> 06:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
and who's responsible to investigate the
 
06:15:15.430 --> 06:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
issues uh the current RSA allows the
 
06:15:19.868 --> 06:15:19.878 align:start position:0%
board of tax and land appeals uh btla to
 
06:15:21.868 --> 06:15:21.878 align:start position:0%
retroactively assess multiple years of
 
06:15:24.430 --> 06:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes once an appeal has been
 
06:15:26.788 --> 06:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
initiated likely surprise Rising
 
06:15:29.468 --> 06:15:29.478 align:start position:0%
taxpayers with a significant Bill
 
06:15:31.868 --> 06:15:31.878 align:start position:0%
admittedly what I know about this issue
 
06:15:34.270 --> 06:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
comes from uh a constituent who brought
 
06:15:36.350 --> 06:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
this to me and a conversation with a
 
06:15:38.070 --> 06:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
member of the btla
 
06:15:41.230 --> 06:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
recently so um I'm happy to answer
 
06:15:43.390 --> 06:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
questions and promptly defer them to
 
06:15:45.750 --> 06:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
Witnesses who will testify after me who
 
06:15:47.948 --> 06:15:47.958 align:start position:0%

good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
06:16:47.628 --> 06:16:47.638 align:start position:0%
the committee um I was involved in
 
06:16:49.788 --> 06:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
several of the matters that may have
 
06:16:52.670 --> 06:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
given rise to this uh particular
 
06:16:54.990 --> 06:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
proposal uh on behalf of the
 
06:16:58.830 --> 06:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
Dr the town of oap town excuse me sir I
 
06:17:00.190 --> 06:17:00.200 align:start position:0%
I always forget to mention when you
 
06:17:01.510 --> 06:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
first take the mic could you please
 
06:17:03.590 --> 06:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
explain if you're for or against uh we
 
06:17:05.190 --> 06:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
know up here but the rest of the
 
06:17:08.510 --> 06:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
committee and Spectators do
 
06:17:11.948 --> 06:17:11.958 align:start position:0%
not we're here more or less against it
 
06:17:14.310 --> 06:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's we're here for primarily
 
06:17:17.150 --> 06:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
information purposes about the the the
 
06:17:18.628 --> 06:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
background of the
 
06:17:21.910 --> 06:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill um we see it as a bit of a solution
 
06:17:25.548 --> 06:17:25.558 align:start position:0%
in search of a problem and um this comes
 
06:17:27.230 --> 06:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
from our experience working with the
 
06:17:29.628 --> 06:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
btla and the case the cases involving
 
06:17:34.310 --> 06:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
oopy Alton and Center Harbor um we were
 
06:17:36.670 --> 06:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
called as Witnesses in in the Alton and
 
06:17:41.030 --> 06:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
Center Harbor cases and not as assigned
 
06:17:44.548 --> 06:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
tasks or hired investigators by the
 
06:17:48.830 --> 06:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
board uh we have the the the Dr has a
 
06:17:51.310 --> 06:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
great deal of expertise and information
 
06:17:53.350 --> 06:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
that they per they perform assessment
 
06:17:56.270 --> 06:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring and they look into things
 
06:17:57.788 --> 06:17:57.798 align:start position:0%
that are going on in the assessment
 
06:18:00.190 --> 06:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
practices in towns and they do it on a
 
06:18:01.708 --> 06:18:01.718 align:start position:0%
periodic basis and they collect
 
06:18:04.270 --> 06:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
information and the btla sometimes finds
 
06:18:07.230 --> 06:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
that information useful and important to
 
06:18:10.948 --> 06:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
consider um in the in the oopy case we
 
06:18:10.958 --> 06:18:12.270 align:start position:0%
consider um in the in the oopy case we
were

06:18:12.270 --> 06:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:18:16.070 --> 06:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
um the the btla used a statutory
 
06:18:17.548 --> 06:18:17.558 align:start position:0%
provision which is not called into
 
06:18:20.030 --> 06:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
question by this amendment to order a
 
06:18:23.430 --> 06:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
reassessment of the institutionally
 
06:18:25.750 --> 06:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
exempt properties in town and they did
 
06:18:28.190 --> 06:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
that because they made a finding that
 
06:18:30.628 --> 06:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
the quality of the tax taxing District's
 
06:18:33.110 --> 06:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
program for maintenance of assessment
 
06:18:36.350 --> 06:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
Equity was not adequate and so they they
 
06:18:38.788 --> 06:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
felt that the town's assessor at that
 
06:18:42.270 --> 06:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
time was not doing his job appropriately
 
06:18:44.868 --> 06:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
and they asked the Dr essentially to do
 
06:18:48.788 --> 06:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
it instead this was not a a an
 
06:18:51.510 --> 06:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
investigative services performed on the
 
06:18:54.270 --> 06:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
board's behalf it was a reassessment
 
06:19:00.590 --> 06:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:03.708 --> 06:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
16 the other two cases or none of these
 
06:19:06.230 --> 06:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
cases actually resulted in any
 
06:19:09.110 --> 06:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
significant look back in assessment or
 
06:19:11.948 --> 06:19:11.958 align:start position:0%
re reevaluation of these properties um
 
06:19:15.670 --> 06:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
in two of the cases the btla found that
 
06:19:18.270 --> 06:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
the equities prevented them from looking
 
06:19:21.110 --> 06:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
further back than one or two years where
 
06:19:24.230 --> 06:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
in a couple of the cases they found that
 
06:19:27.230 --> 06:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
um the towns had
 
06:19:30.670 --> 06:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
allowed exemptions of properties for
 
06:19:33.070 --> 06:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
many years that that those properties
 
06:19:35.510 --> 06:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
were not entitled to but they found that
 
06:19:37.430 --> 06:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
it was be overly burdensome or
 
06:19:39.670 --> 06:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and inequitable to require
 
06:19:42.030 --> 06:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
them to be reassessed and essentially
 
06:19:46.150 --> 06:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
PID taxes for many prior years
 
06:19:48.708 --> 06:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
so what I say that we see this as sort
 
06:19:51.468 --> 06:19:51.478 align:start position:0%
of a kind of a a solution in search of a
 
06:19:54.270 --> 06:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
problem these cases and and the history
 
06:19:56.868 --> 06:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
over the last few years don't really
 
06:19:59.948 --> 06:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
show that there's a need to fix this
 
06:20:02.788 --> 06:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
thing um and it could at some level
 
06:20:06.830 --> 06:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
interfere with the ability of the Dr to
 
06:20:11.070 --> 06:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
respond to uh requests for information
 
06:20:13.590 --> 06:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
and testimony and proceedings uh and
 
06:20:15.350 --> 06:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
interfere with the dr's ability
 
06:20:18.590 --> 06:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
Performance Mission to assure that
 
06:20:20.628 --> 06:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
taxing and exemptions are done equitably
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
and fairly because as I'm sure you
 
06:20:25.270 --> 06:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
understand every exempt property is
 
06:20:25.280 --> 06:20:26.270 align:start position:0%
understand every exempt property is
essentially

06:20:26.270 --> 06:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
06:20:27.910 --> 06:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
a slight burden on all the other
 
06:20:29.788 --> 06:20:29.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in town so if somebody's
 
06:20:31.948 --> 06:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
getting an exemption for a piece of
 
06:20:33.948 --> 06:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
property that they're not entitled to
 
06:20:35.868 --> 06:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
and if it's gone on for many years
 
06:20:37.510 --> 06:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's a burden that's now been shared
 
06:20:40.948 --> 06:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
by the other taxpayers in town and so
 
06:20:43.590 --> 06:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
the the btas and they can speak to this
 
06:20:46.110 --> 06:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
they're here um you know one of their
 
06:20:47.548 --> 06:20:47.558 align:start position:0%
missions is to make sure that those kind
 
06:20:50.510 --> 06:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
of things don't happen and the Dr in
 
06:20:52.750 --> 06:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
some instances is called to provide
 
06:20:54.510 --> 06:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
information and testimony to support
 
06:20:56.548 --> 06:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
that mission
 
06:20:58.830 --> 06:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess that's all I have to say
 
06:21:01.030 --> 06:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
about it and I'll be happy to take any
 
06:21:04.310 --> 06:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions and uh Adam denore is the
 
06:21:05.948 --> 06:21:05.958 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the municipal and
 
06:21:08.350 --> 06:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
property Division and he's been around
 
06:21:12.270 --> 06:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
for most of this U work as well and he's
 
06:21:13.868 --> 06:21:13.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sure he'd be happy to answer any
 
06:21:15.788 --> 06:21:15.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
06:21:15.798 --> 06:21:17.430 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
representative

06:21:17.430 --> 06:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:21:19.670 --> 06:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:21:21.750 --> 06:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so there's two
 
06:21:24.670 --> 06:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
parts to this bill and I'm um curious
 
06:21:26.430 --> 06:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
about the second part
 
06:21:29.110 --> 06:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
that um speaks to the Investigative
 
06:21:33.270 --> 06:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
Services done by the Dr so the bill says
 
06:21:35.990 --> 06:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
the board which is the
 
06:21:40.750 --> 06:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
btla shall not rely on the Dr to provide
 
06:21:44.030 --> 06:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services do you read this
 
06:21:45.548 --> 06:21:45.558 align:start position:0%
to mean
 
06:21:48.548 --> 06:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
that the Dr could still provide
 
06:21:51.670 --> 06:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services and some I'm a
 
06:21:54.750 --> 06:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
little confused by that and could you
 
06:21:57.190 --> 06:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
help clarify thank you for that question
 
06:21:58.948 --> 06:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I can help clarify that
 
06:22:02.628 --> 06:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
because I'm confused by it as well um
 
06:22:05.510 --> 06:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
we've never been asked by the btla to
 
06:22:07.468 --> 06:22:07.478 align:start position:0%
provide Investigative Services on the
 
06:22:09.948 --> 06:22:09.958 align:start position:0%
board's behalf at least not in my
 
06:22:12.190 --> 06:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
experience since
 
06:22:15.628 --> 06:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
2017 um it's my understanding and the
 
06:22:17.390 --> 06:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
the folks from the board can speak to
 
06:22:19.830 --> 06:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
this they have their own investigators
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
to do this work or they can get
 
06:22:27.990 --> 06:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
them for the questions representative
 
06:22:30.628 --> 06:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman so this is
 
06:22:32.670 --> 06:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
kind of the question I asked Mr Hicks
 
06:22:34.830 --> 06:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks so how many of
 
06:22:37.070 --> 06:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
these and how far back could you go to
 
06:22:40.190 --> 06:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
do this search thank you thank you for
 
06:22:43.628 --> 06:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
your question as I said in in the five
 
06:22:46.110 --> 06:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
years or six years that I've been
 
06:22:48.350 --> 06:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
working for the Dr this this kind of
 
06:22:51.628 --> 06:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
issue has come up in essentially two
 
06:22:54.788 --> 06:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
cases Alton and Center Harbor and in
 
06:22:57.310 --> 06:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
both of those cases is while there was
 
06:22:59.510 --> 06:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
evidence that the both of those towns
 
06:23:03.070 --> 06:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
had extensive record of not doing the
 
06:23:05.070 --> 06:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions properly that is granting
 
06:23:07.230 --> 06:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
exemptions to property owners who are
 
06:23:10.948 --> 06:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
not entitled to them the board declined
 
06:23:10.958 --> 06:23:12.548 align:start position:0%
not entitled to them the board declined
to

06:23:12.548 --> 06:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:23:16.150 --> 06:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
um do reassessments for all of those
 
06:23:18.430 --> 06:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
past years because they found it to be
 
06:23:23.548 --> 06:23:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:26.310 --> 06:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
inequitable sure go ahead you also
 
06:23:28.190 --> 06:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned oopy could you touch on that
 
06:23:33.670 --> 06:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
too thank you so oopy was came to our
 
06:23:35.070 --> 06:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
came to the board's attention and the
 
06:23:38.628 --> 06:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
dr's attention when a taxpayer
 
06:23:42.310 --> 06:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
complained to the btla and to the Dr
 
06:23:45.110 --> 06:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
that the town had improperly granted an
 
06:23:49.030 --> 06:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
exemption to an organization in this in
 
06:23:52.628 --> 06:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
believe in one or two years um there was
 
06:23:55.070 --> 06:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
a long process involving the town's
 
06:23:55.080 --> 06:23:56.310 align:start position:0%
a long process involving the town's
assess

06:23:56.310 --> 06:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
assess
 
06:23:59.868 --> 06:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
and the town and the board that
 
06:24:02.830 --> 06:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
developed over a couple of years that
 
06:24:05.708 --> 06:24:05.718 align:start position:0%
left the board feeling a lack of
 
06:24:07.590 --> 06:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
confidence in the Assessor's
 
06:24:10.708 --> 06:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
capabilities and work and responses to
 
06:24:12.910 --> 06:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
the board's questions and inquiries and
 
06:24:15.868 --> 06:24:15.878 align:start position:0%
requests for information and and as a
 
06:24:20.670 --> 06:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
result of that the um board ordered the
 
06:24:23.868 --> 06:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
Dr to perform a reassessment of those
 
06:24:26.830 --> 06:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
properties which we did and completed
 
06:24:29.030 --> 06:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
just what two weeks
 
06:24:34.190 --> 06:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
ago and that involves something like 17
 
06:24:38.150 --> 06:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
properties and only for the years 22 and
 
06:24:42.590 --> 06:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
23 thank you for
 
06:24:45.150 --> 06:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have a quick
 
06:24:47.310 --> 06:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
question for you um these cases that
 
06:24:49.628 --> 06:24:49.638 align:start position:0%
you're talking about do you have a
 
06:24:52.230 --> 06:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
document that would that
 
06:24:54.310 --> 06:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
summarizes uh like say what happened in
 
06:24:55.788 --> 06:24:55.798 align:start position:0%
Alton what happened
 
06:24:58.590 --> 06:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
sen Harbor is it like a it's not a court
 
06:25:00.110 --> 06:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
case I know but do you have a
 
06:25:02.830 --> 06:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
summarizing document on any of those
 
06:25:05.468 --> 06:25:05.478 align:start position:0%
there thank you for your question and I
 
06:25:08.270 --> 06:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
I I do not have a document like that
 
06:25:11.150 --> 06:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
with me um the board has prepared a
 
06:25:14.030 --> 06:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
series of orders that could be provided
 
06:25:15.910 --> 06:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
although that would require this
 
06:25:18.190 --> 06:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
committee to sort of analyze them and
 
06:25:21.350 --> 06:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
look at them um I could inquire of the
 
06:25:24.070 --> 06:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner to see if I if we could
 
06:25:25.830 --> 06:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
provide something that's some summarizes
 
06:25:28.070 --> 06:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
those cases at least from the dr's
 
06:25:30.590 --> 06:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
perspective for myself I I would love if
 
06:25:32.390 --> 06:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
you could do that on say a couple of
 
06:25:33.830 --> 06:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
them or even just one of them just so I
 
06:25:36.670 --> 06:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
can get an idea of what you're doing I
 
06:25:39.390 --> 06:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many want to see it but
 
06:25:41.030 --> 06:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh when you get it if you could send it
 
06:25:43.430 --> 06:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
to me that'd be great certainly I I'll
 
06:25:45.110 --> 06:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll ask the commissioner I don't
 
06:25:47.190 --> 06:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
have the authority to offer that but I'm
 
06:25:49.670 --> 06:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
sure I I could probably persuade her to
 
06:25:52.830 --> 06:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
do it okay thank you further
 
06:25:54.830 --> 06:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you for your
 
06:25:58.310 --> 06:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
testimony morning thank you uh next up
 
06:25:58.320 --> 06:25:59.350 align:start position:0%
testimony morning thank you uh next up
we

06:25:59.350 --> 06:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:26:13.750 --> 06:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:15.750 --> 06:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
btla good
 
06:26:19.830 --> 06:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon um yes it is another twer um I
 
06:26:21.430 --> 06:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
am Teresa Walker I'm a member of the
 
06:26:24.310 --> 06:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
board of tax and land appeals um I was
 
06:26:27.070 --> 06:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
appointed to the board in
 
06:26:30.910 --> 06:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
2012 um with me is an stac she's the
 
06:26:32.670 --> 06:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
board's Clerk and has been the board's
 
06:26:35.510 --> 06:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
clerk for over 25 years and behind us is
 
06:26:37.510 --> 06:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
Michelle Le BR who is the the board's
 
06:26:41.350 --> 06:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
chair so um we did provide some written
 
06:26:44.430 --> 06:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
testimony um we sent it through the the
 
06:26:46.390 --> 06:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
kiosk the website so hopefully uh the
 
06:26:47.430 --> 06:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
committee members have had an
 
06:26:49.910 --> 06:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to at least receive it I
 
06:26:51.350 --> 06:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
know it came today so you probably
 
06:26:54.390 --> 06:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
haven't had an opportunity to digest it
 
06:26:57.350 --> 06:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
um but I'll I'll begin my testimony by
 
06:26:59.468 --> 06:26:59.478 align:start position:0%
saying that as written the board cannot
 
06:27:01.230 --> 06:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
support this piece of
 
06:27:03.350 --> 06:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
legislation um and there's a number of
 
06:27:06.948 --> 06:27:06.958 align:start position:0%
reasons why um as drafted we find the
 
06:27:09.628 --> 06:27:09.638 align:start position:0%
language to be very ambiguous and rather
 
06:27:09.638 --> 06:27:10.670 align:start position:0%
language to be very ambiguous and rather
than

06:27:10.670 --> 06:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
than
 
06:27:12.948 --> 06:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
clarifying any of the statutes that the
 
06:27:15.110 --> 06:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
board works with it's providing
 
06:27:19.070 --> 06:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
additional levels of gray area I would
 
06:27:21.628 --> 06:27:21.638 align:start position:0%
say um
 
06:27:24.190 --> 06:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
specifically um the phrase outside the
 
06:27:28.190 --> 06:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
years in question gen um the words
 
06:27:29.948 --> 06:27:29.958 align:start position:0%
themselves are easy to understand but
 
06:27:31.628 --> 06:27:31.638 align:start position:0%
when you apply those words to the
 
06:27:33.948 --> 06:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
various statutes that the board has
 
06:27:37.990 --> 06:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to hear appeals from that
 
06:27:40.510 --> 06:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
becomes very murky most property tax
 
06:27:43.310 --> 06:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
appeals specifically are retroactive in
 
06:27:46.430 --> 06:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
nature uh Municipal reassessments are
 
06:27:50.070 --> 06:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
prospective in nature so is the statute
 
06:27:53.310 --> 06:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
talking about the current calendar year
 
06:27:55.548 --> 06:27:55.558 align:start position:0%
the current tax year
 
06:27:58.190 --> 06:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
um a certain number of tax years before
 
06:28:00.670 --> 06:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
and after the date that we hear the case
 
06:28:04.030 --> 06:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's not clear um the second reason
 
06:28:07.708 --> 06:28:07.718 align:start position:0%
that we can't support it is it is intend
 
06:28:11.708 --> 06:28:11.718 align:start position:0%
the bill is drafted to amend um chapter
 
06:28:14.788 --> 06:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
71b which is a very general statute it's
 
06:28:16.990 --> 06:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
the board's enabling
 
06:28:19.468 --> 06:28:19.478 align:start position:0%
statute if this issue has
 
06:28:24.230 --> 06:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
aisen regarding um some prior rulings
 
06:28:26.468 --> 06:28:26.478 align:start position:0%
that the board has made in institutional
 
06:28:31.030 --> 06:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
exemption cases perhaps a clarification
 
06:28:33.390 --> 06:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
of a date would be appropriate in
 
06:28:35.990 --> 06:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
chapter 72 which pertains specifically
 
06:28:38.548 --> 06:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
to those exemption properties that we
 
06:28:42.270 --> 06:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit about um but the
 
06:28:45.390 --> 06:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
general statute of 71b would apply to
 
06:28:48.030 --> 06:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
all cases that come before the board
 
06:28:50.628 --> 06:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
including current use
 
06:28:50.638 --> 06:28:52.830 align:start position:0%
including current use
including

06:28:52.830 --> 06:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
including
 
06:28:57.788 --> 06:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
um uh excavation including all state
 
06:29:02.468 --> 06:29:02.478 align:start position:0%
taxes rooms and meals and so forth
 
06:29:05.590 --> 06:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
um regarding the second part of this in
 
06:29:07.750 --> 06:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
the investigative services on behalf of
 
06:29:11.868 --> 06:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
the board I E I will just say ditto to
 
06:29:15.190 --> 06:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
what uh attorney Ro testified to we have
 
06:29:18.430 --> 06:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
the board has not in its history asked
 
06:29:20.830 --> 06:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue to provide any
 
06:29:23.708 --> 06:29:23.718 align:start position:0%
sort of Investigative Services the board
 
06:29:27.150 --> 06:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
has asked um that the Dr
 
06:29:30.150 --> 06:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
provide copies of any investigations
 
06:29:33.548 --> 06:29:33.558 align:start position:0%
they may have done under their separate
 
06:29:33.558 --> 06:29:35.670 align:start position:0%
they may have done under their separate
jurisdiction

06:29:35.670 --> 06:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
06:29:38.590 --> 06:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
um in one specific statute that comes to
 
06:29:42.868 --> 06:29:42.878 align:start position:0%
mind in terms of Timber tax um the board
 
06:29:46.750 --> 06:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
has the specific authority to request
 
06:29:49.830 --> 06:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue provide
 
06:29:53.150 --> 06:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
experts testimony uh they on their staff
 
06:29:55.350 --> 06:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
have some subject matter experts in the
 
06:29:57.750 --> 06:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
area of Timber which the board does not
 
06:30:00.070 --> 06:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
have so in those cases we have called
 
06:30:02.430 --> 06:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
upon them to provide that testimony but
 
06:30:05.070 --> 06:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
in no in no shape or form have we
 
06:30:08.990 --> 06:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
ordered or requested the Dr um do any
 
06:30:11.830 --> 06:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
sort of Investigation on the board's
 
06:30:11.840 --> 06:30:13.350 align:start position:0%
sort of Investigation on the board's
behalf

06:30:13.350 --> 06:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
06:30:17.030 --> 06:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
um with that
 
06:30:20.548 --> 06:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
um the we've heard testimony very kind
 
06:30:22.948 --> 06:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
of vague testimony regarding
 
06:30:27.110 --> 06:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
oapi Alton and Center Harbor all three
 
06:30:30.990 --> 06:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
of those uh cases uh came to the board
 
06:30:34.430 --> 06:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
um two of them as a result of taxpayer
 
06:30:36.990 --> 06:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
complaints and one of those arose from
 
06:30:40.910 --> 06:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony in the oapi case
 
06:30:43.990 --> 06:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
um all of those cases had to do with the
 
06:30:47.548 --> 06:30:47.558 align:start position:0%
granting of charitable
 
06:30:51.030 --> 06:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
exemptions um actually I take that back
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
OAB had to do with charitable and
 
06:30:53.760 --> 06:30:55.788 align:start position:0%
OAB had to do with charitable and
religious

06:30:55.788 --> 06:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
religious
 
06:30:57.590 --> 06:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think educational and the other
 
06:31:00.830 --> 06:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
two were about charitable um in the town
 
06:31:04.190 --> 06:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
of oapi which is the first case um the
 
06:31:06.388 --> 06:31:06.398 align:start position:0%
board did order the taxpayer who had
 
06:31:09.430 --> 06:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
improperly been granted the uh
 
06:31:12.910 --> 06:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
charitable exemption to repay the town a
 
06:31:15.990 --> 06:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
total of three years um the board
 
06:31:19.468 --> 06:31:19.478 align:start position:0%
asserted its Authority um that has been
 
06:31:20.990 --> 06:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
given to it in
 
06:31:24.430 --> 06:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
71b and in several uh Supreme Court
 
06:31:26.350 --> 06:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
cases is most notably of which is the
 
06:31:29.350 --> 06:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
appeal of woodlow um which I do have a
 
06:31:30.750 --> 06:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
copy of here I'm happy to share that
 
06:31:33.590 --> 06:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the committee
 
06:31:38.750 --> 06:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
um the the statute is not clear on how
 
06:31:44.310 --> 06:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:47.948 --> 06:31:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:51.430 --> 06:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
board was faced with having to as was
 
06:31:53.948 --> 06:31:53.958 align:start position:0%
testified to by attorney Ro trying to
 
06:31:56.510 --> 06:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
balance the I ities
 
06:31:56.520 --> 06:31:58.468 align:start position:0%
balance the I ities
of

06:31:58.468 --> 06:31:58.478 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:32:01.150 --> 06:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
the the financial burden this may place
 
06:32:02.708 --> 06:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
on the specific
 
06:32:05.030 --> 06:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer as well as the
 
06:32:07.190 --> 06:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
disproportionality that the granting of
 
06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
the exemption caused to all other
 
06:32:13.030 --> 06:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers within the
 
06:32:15.708 --> 06:32:15.718 align:start position:0%
community given everything in the record
 
06:32:19.150 --> 06:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
the board found that ordering those
 
06:32:22.948 --> 06:32:22.958 align:start position:0%
three years which took the taxpayer or
 
06:32:25.150 --> 06:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
the the payments back to
 
06:32:28.150 --> 06:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
the town's last Municipal wide re
 
06:32:30.030 --> 06:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
assessment to be
 
06:32:30.040 --> 06:32:33.270 align:start position:0%
assessment to be
reasonable

06:32:33.270 --> 06:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:36.388 --> 06:32:36.398 align:start position:0%
um they had received that exemption for
 
06:32:38.270 --> 06:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
many years more than
 
06:32:38.280 --> 06:32:40.270 align:start position:0%
many years more than
that

06:32:40.270 --> 06:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:32:42.190 --> 06:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
um in
 
06:32:44.868 --> 06:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
Meredith and in Alton the board took a
 
06:32:47.388 --> 06:32:47.398 align:start position:0%
similar stance Center Harbor I'm sorry
 
06:32:49.230 --> 06:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
what did I say again I said that earlier
 
06:32:52.070 --> 06:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
today too in both other cases the board
 
06:32:54.590 --> 06:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
um found in a very similar fashion we
 
06:32:57.388 --> 06:32:57.398 align:start position:0%
ordered repayments back to the date of
 
06:32:59.070 --> 06:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
the last
 
06:33:01.910 --> 06:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
revaluation um in Alton I believe that
 
06:33:03.270 --> 06:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
was 2
 
06:33:05.670 --> 06:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
years and
 
06:33:07.670 --> 06:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
in Center
 
06:33:10.350 --> 06:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
Harbor it actually ended up being no
 
06:33:13.270 --> 06:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
years because they had revaled just
 
06:33:16.830 --> 06:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:23.548 --> 06:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:23.558 --> 06:33:25.270 align:start position:0%
 
board

06:33:25.270 --> 06:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:33:27.670 --> 06:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
does not have to deal with these
 
06:33:30.150 --> 06:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
issues on a regular
 
06:33:33.270 --> 06:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
basis these three cases clustered close
 
06:33:36.110 --> 06:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
together was very
 
06:33:36.120 --> 06:33:37.868 align:start position:0%
together was very
unusual

06:33:37.868 --> 06:33:37.878 align:start position:0%
unusual
 
06:33:41.468 --> 06:33:41.478 align:start position:0%
um and actually our clerk has data to to
 
06:33:43.788 --> 06:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
show how many cases and what the
 
06:33:46.030 --> 06:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
disposition of those cases were yes I
 
06:33:47.910 --> 06:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
can answer your question representative
 
06:33:50.750 --> 06:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
Brown because I am a statistics person
 
06:33:53.590 --> 06:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
and I I have been there for over 20
 
06:33:56.070 --> 06:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
years and I was surprised um I thought
 
06:34:00.070 --> 06:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
we had actually more but we have um a
 
06:34:01.990 --> 06:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
total of
 
06:34:04.868 --> 06:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
15 including the three that were most
 
06:34:06.468 --> 06:34:06.478 align:start position:0%
recent three of those dealt with
 
06:34:10.150 --> 06:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
exemptions but the other 12 were all
 
06:34:12.030 --> 06:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
you'll be shocked neighbor versus
 
06:34:14.310 --> 06:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
neighbor because nothing makes a great
 
06:34:16.110 --> 06:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
case like when your neighbor doesn't
 
06:34:17.388 --> 06:34:17.398 align:start position:0%
like what you're doing on your property
 
06:34:18.708 --> 06:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
and you're he thinks you're getting away
 
06:34:22.270 --> 06:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
with something so the 12 were neighbor
 
06:34:25.310 --> 06:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
versus neighbor and a complaint so three
 
06:34:28.030 --> 06:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
of them were exemptions um there were
 
06:34:31.948 --> 06:34:31.958 align:start position:0%
eight times where again there was a
 
06:34:35.628 --> 06:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
couple of neighbors or um just the board
 
06:34:37.910 --> 06:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
on their own figured out by way of
 
06:34:40.190 --> 06:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
another case that uh we should look into
 
06:34:42.030 --> 06:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
this there's something
 
06:34:44.788 --> 06:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
wrong eight cases and they never
 
06:34:46.788 --> 06:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
asserted jurisdiction but all they did
 
06:34:49.190 --> 06:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
was send out an order saying hey what's
 
06:34:51.788 --> 06:34:51.798 align:start position:0%
going on here tell us what's happening
 
06:34:53.670 --> 06:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
are we seeing this wrong or is this
 
06:34:54.990 --> 06:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
person wrong
 
06:34:56.670 --> 06:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
and they never ended up asserting their
 
06:34:59.310 --> 06:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so when you look at it 15
 
06:35:01.590 --> 06:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
times three were exemptions which are
 
06:35:03.628 --> 06:35:03.638 align:start position:0%
embedded in chapter
 
06:35:07.310 --> 06:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
2072 and the rest were under chapter
 
06:35:11.270 --> 06:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
76 um and there is no time limit that is
 
06:35:13.110 --> 06:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely for certain but in the case
 
06:35:15.750 --> 06:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
of Center Harbor and and this is what I
 
06:35:17.350 --> 06:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
will say about it I'm happy to provide
 
06:35:19.830 --> 06:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
you an oopy order I actually came armed
 
06:35:22.388 --> 06:35:22.398 align:start position:0%
with enough copies of one oopy of one
 
06:35:24.590 --> 06:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
oopy order that I think encapsulates
 
06:35:27.510 --> 06:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a summary but it will give you
 
06:35:31.110 --> 06:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
the most detail um but in Center Harbor
 
06:35:33.670 --> 06:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
that particular charitable or was
 
06:35:35.548 --> 06:35:35.558 align:start position:0%
religious excuse me religious entity
 
06:35:38.708 --> 06:35:38.718 align:start position:0%
escaped taxation for 17 years and had
 
06:35:41.030 --> 06:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
they collected the money the town of
 
06:35:42.868 --> 06:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
Center Harbor and those taxpayers would
 
06:35:44.750 --> 06:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
have benefited from $2
 
06:35:47.310 --> 06:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
million so I sat in a My Town
 
06:35:49.830 --> 06:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
deliberative session this weekend and I
 
06:35:51.190 --> 06:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
tell you the longest eight and a half
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
hours of my life listening to people
 
06:35:55.788 --> 06:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
upset about my taxes my taxes we went
 
06:35:57.230 --> 06:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
through a reval the tax rates through
 
06:36:00.070 --> 06:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
the roof well $2 million in a town like
 
06:36:03.350 --> 06:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
Center Harbor you know so that's the
 
06:36:05.270 --> 06:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's the piece but for the rest of
 
06:36:08.150 --> 06:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
these people um exemptions weren't the
 
06:36:11.708 --> 06:36:11.718 align:start position:0%
case that is that's the norm um out of
 
06:36:13.468 --> 06:36:13.478 align:start position:0%
all the appeals we get a year and the
 
06:36:15.430 --> 06:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
average is you know anywhere right now
 
06:36:18.548 --> 06:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
we're roughly we have you know 700 cases
 
06:36:22.388 --> 06:36:22.398 align:start position:0%
open a year with about 400 new filed um
 
06:36:25.468 --> 06:36:25.478 align:start position:0%
going back the earliest I could find was
 
06:36:27.750 --> 06:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
1995 and that's where I'm getting this
 
06:36:29.750 --> 06:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
data from from
 
06:36:33.590 --> 06:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
1995 um so if that's
 
06:36:36.868 --> 06:36:36.878 align:start position:0%
helpful as U Miss stach mentioned we do
 
06:36:39.190 --> 06:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the order in op that the
 
06:36:43.548 --> 06:36:43.558 align:start position:0%
board wrote um and it's the order that
 
06:36:45.430 --> 06:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
the in which the board ordered the
 
06:36:47.230 --> 06:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration to
 
06:36:50.388 --> 06:36:50.398 align:start position:0%
actually perform the reassessment of the
 
06:36:52.670 --> 06:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
institutional exempt properties in O and
 
06:36:54.350 --> 06:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
we're happy to provide that to the
 
06:36:56.350 --> 06:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee if you'd like
 
06:36:59.750 --> 06:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
that thank Youk you very much
 
06:36:59.760 --> 06:37:01.070 align:start position:0%
that thank Youk you very much
representative

06:37:01.070 --> 06:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:37:03.948 --> 06:37:03.958 align:start position:0%
yella thank you uh thank you for taking
 
06:37:07.190 --> 06:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:10.990 --> 06:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
um it seems from your testimony that the
 
06:37:12.628 --> 06:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
statute is
 
06:37:12.638 --> 06:37:14.350 align:start position:0%
statute is
unclear

06:37:14.350 --> 06:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
06:37:18.868 --> 06:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
um about how long you
 
06:37:22.548 --> 06:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
can do these these assess uh
 
06:37:25.548 --> 06:37:25.558 align:start position:0%
reassessments or re-evaluations or or
 
06:37:28.110 --> 06:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
assess penalties and
 
06:37:32.510 --> 06:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
maybe in and the essentially the the
 
06:37:33.868 --> 06:37:33.878 align:start position:0%
legislature has given you that
 
06:37:37.750 --> 06:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility to let's say if in the case
 
06:37:39.708 --> 06:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
uh if a case came before you that you
 
06:37:41.270 --> 06:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
felt that there was fraud or something
 
06:37:43.388 --> 06:37:43.398 align:start position:0%
like that that you may say like okay
 
06:37:44.990 --> 06:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
you're going back all the way to the end
 
06:37:47.670 --> 06:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
of time because you did something wrong
 
06:37:49.868 --> 06:37:49.878 align:start position:0%
and you knew it versus oh it was an
 
06:37:51.270 --> 06:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
honest mistake or something like that
 
06:37:53.830 --> 06:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe you could be more lenient and
 
06:37:56.230 --> 06:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
um is that the case or are you kind of
 
06:37:59.030 --> 06:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
setting a precedent that no every single
 
06:38:01.190 --> 06:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
time we're just going to go back to a v
 
06:38:03.830 --> 06:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh the last EV
 
06:38:07.830 --> 06:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
vow um I can't sit here well first of
 
06:38:09.548 --> 06:38:09.558 align:start position:0%
all none of the orders in any of those
 
06:38:11.750 --> 06:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
three cases made a blanket statement
 
06:38:13.310 --> 06:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
that this is what the board will always
 
06:38:16.070 --> 06:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
find the the decisions are always very
 
06:38:19.948 --> 06:38:19.958 align:start position:0%
fact specific to the case
 
06:38:22.230 --> 06:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
um but I think some of the issues that
 
06:38:24.310 --> 06:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
you raised may be those things that the
 
06:38:25.628 --> 06:38:25.638 align:start position:0%
board would take into consideration
 
06:38:26.868 --> 06:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
before making a
 
06:38:30.708 --> 06:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
decision um the it isn't that the
 
06:38:32.990 --> 06:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
statute isn't clear on what the timeline
 
06:38:37.990 --> 06:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
is it's 100% silent on the issue okay so
 
06:38:40.270 --> 06:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
the board gleans its Authority from case
 
06:38:43.670 --> 06:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
law has written that um and again it's
 
06:38:45.310 --> 06:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
the a case of wood flower that I have
 
06:38:47.310 --> 06:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
and we can distribute and I see Miss
 
06:38:49.270 --> 06:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
delmock looking at another case so I
 
06:38:52.270 --> 06:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
will let her go with
 
06:38:55.830 --> 06:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
that yeah this just goes to put this in
 
06:38:57.868 --> 06:38:57.878 align:start position:0%
reference I found a case Hill versus
 
06:39:01.910 --> 06:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
Martin 1954 great year and this court
 
06:39:03.910 --> 06:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
does the Supreme Court said since the
 
06:39:07.270 --> 06:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
legislature imposed no time limit within
 
06:39:09.310 --> 06:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
which a reassessment should be made it
 
06:39:11.270 --> 06:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
must be deemed to have anticipated the
 
06:39:14.430 --> 06:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
inevitable results of a late
 
06:39:17.548 --> 06:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
correction so
 
06:39:20.468 --> 06:39:20.478 align:start position:0%
1954 they didn't know it
 
06:39:24.030 --> 06:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
then representative Brown thank you Mr
 
06:39:26.708 --> 06:39:26.718 align:start position:0%
chairman so just a quick followup I'm
 
06:39:27.948 --> 06:39:27.958 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure I understood it
 
06:39:30.510 --> 06:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
correctly so on the center Harbor case
 
06:39:32.150 --> 06:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
which had to do with a religious
 
06:39:36.868 --> 06:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
exemption right you found that it wasn't
 
06:39:39.230 --> 06:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
the exemption wasn't proper and that you
 
06:39:41.990 --> 06:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
went back to the last assessment and
 
06:39:44.590 --> 06:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
even though you found that they were due
 
06:39:48.230 --> 06:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
$2 million there was no additional
 
06:39:51.910 --> 06:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
assessment that is that is correct thank
 
06:39:55.670 --> 06:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
you further questions
 
06:39:57.510 --> 06:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you ladies for your
 
06:40:00.150 --> 06:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much I have one
 
06:40:10.110 --> 06:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:12.190 --> 06:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
Haywood sure I don't forget to turn that
 
06:40:15.230 --> 06:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
on welcome thank you Mr chairman members
 
06:40:17.628 --> 06:40:17.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Todd Haywood
 
06:40:19.468 --> 06:40:19.478 align:start position:0%
uh I live in conquered New Hampshire
 
06:40:21.750 --> 06:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks is my
 
06:40:23.548 --> 06:40:23.558 align:start position:0%
representative I've uh I've been a
 
06:40:24.990 --> 06:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
member of the the assessment assessing
 
06:40:28.430 --> 06:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
Community for 24 years now um I am a
 
06:40:32.628 --> 06:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
consultant for 11 towns so I provide
 
06:40:34.948 --> 06:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
assessment advice to the statutory
 
06:40:38.150 --> 06:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
assessors who are the selectman or uh if
 
06:40:40.510 --> 06:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
there is one Board of assessors so as
 
06:40:42.510 --> 06:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
you can imagine you can give advice
 
06:40:43.788 --> 06:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're always going
 
06:40:48.310 --> 06:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
to take your advice which is fine U what
 
06:40:50.510 --> 06:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
what I see what I would like to focus on
 
06:40:51.750 --> 06:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
with this
 
06:40:54.910 --> 06:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
is is maybe is Maybe improving the
 
06:40:57.670 --> 06:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
system so that there's a little bit more
 
06:41:00.350 --> 06:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
continuity among different forms of
 
06:41:03.230 --> 06:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
government for example under the current
 
06:41:06.468 --> 06:41:06.478 align:start position:0%
system if I'm a taxpayer and I live in
 
06:41:09.468 --> 06:41:09.478 align:start position:0%
conquered I pay taxes in conquered and
 
06:41:11.270 --> 06:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
Miss stac mentioned neighbor on neighbor
 
06:41:13.190 --> 06:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
but let's just say that my I noticed my
 
06:41:16.548 --> 06:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
neighbor is under assessed well I have
 
06:41:18.788 --> 06:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
90 days to appeal that assessment after
 
06:41:20.430 --> 06:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
the final notice
 
06:41:24.230 --> 06:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
attacks whereas if I were a municipality
 
06:41:27.310 --> 06:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court had said in the late
 
06:41:32.030 --> 06:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
90s in uh the Pheasant Lane realy case
 
06:41:34.270 --> 06:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
where they said if you've I'm
 
06:41:36.590 --> 06:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing and I'm not an attorney but
 
06:41:39.788 --> 06:41:39.798 align:start position:0%
if you've issued a tax and in this case
 
06:41:42.230 --> 06:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
there was the the fee Lane mall and the
 
06:41:44.030 --> 06:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
city discovered that they were grossly
 
06:41:45.788 --> 06:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
under assessing this property in their
 
06:41:48.150 --> 06:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
opinion based on the income they they
 
06:41:50.548 --> 06:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
had estimated income then they gathered
 
06:41:52.230 --> 06:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
information that found the actual income
 
06:41:56.230 --> 06:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
was twice that so they figured it was it
 
06:41:57.708 --> 06:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
was probably in the best interest of the
 
06:42:00.190 --> 06:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
rest of the taxpayers to not let this
 
06:42:01.990 --> 06:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer go under assess so the issued a
 
06:42:03.990 --> 06:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
supplemental tax bill well the Supreme
 
06:42:06.510 --> 06:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
Court said once the tax has been issued
 
06:42:08.948 --> 06:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't add to it for your
 
06:42:10.948 --> 06:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
municipality then again not long after
 
06:42:13.868 --> 06:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
that in in LSP Association versus
 
06:42:17.150 --> 06:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
Guilford belnap County Judge determined
 
06:42:19.310 --> 06:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
that that particular property was under
 
06:42:22.510 --> 06:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
assessed and added a tax based on that
 
06:42:24.150 --> 06:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
of the hearing or the proceeding that
 
06:42:27.270 --> 06:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
day Supreme Court also said can't add a
 
06:42:29.628 --> 06:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
tax you can only Abate so the so what
 
06:42:33.110 --> 06:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'm the point I think is this not
 
06:42:34.548 --> 06:42:34.558 align:start position:0%
necessarily a problem looking for a
 
06:42:37.548 --> 06:42:37.558 align:start position:0%
solution but maybe to bring things more
 
06:42:41.990 --> 06:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
in line it's you know 90 days that tax
 
06:42:45.910 --> 06:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
year tax year under appeal forever you
 
06:42:48.030 --> 06:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
could maybe bring up the taxpayer's
 
06:42:50.310 --> 06:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
ability to to appeal for a year or two
 
06:42:52.590 --> 06:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
or five or whatever same thing with the
 
06:42:55.948 --> 06:42:55.958 align:start position:0%
superior court so the the question is is
 
06:42:59.868 --> 06:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
more an issue for me of of of continuity
 
06:43:02.230 --> 06:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
and and how you how you might address
 
06:43:05.670 --> 06:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
that and and and like that's that in in
 
06:43:07.190 --> 06:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
all the other testimony I I don't have
 
06:43:09.708 --> 06:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
any difference of agreement because your
 
06:43:11.230 --> 06:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
questions I think have been answered so
 
06:43:13.510 --> 06:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
far but I'd be happy to answer any
 
06:43:13.520 --> 06:43:14.430 align:start position:0%
far but I'd be happy to answer any
further

06:43:14.430 --> 06:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:43:16.510 --> 06:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you for the
 
06:43:16.520 --> 06:43:18.468 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you for the
testimony

06:43:18.468 --> 06:43:18.478 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:43:21.190 --> 06:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:43:24.750 --> 06:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
 
06:43:30.350 --> 06:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:33.868 --> 06:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
that for these different appeals the 90
 
06:43:37.070 --> 06:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
days your neighbor so the examples they
 
06:43:41.030 --> 06:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
gave was neighbor on neighbor um you're
 
06:43:43.270 --> 06:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
saying in
 
06:43:47.910 --> 06:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
certain situations they can only appeal
 
06:43:49.830 --> 06:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
but to whom I guess is the question
 
06:43:51.750 --> 06:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
because if it was to the board it seems
 
06:43:54.548 --> 06:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
to be forever and so
 
06:43:58.150 --> 06:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
the who has the 90-day
 
06:44:00.830 --> 06:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
requirement um versus the municipality
 
06:44:02.910 --> 06:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
could the municipality code to the board
 
06:44:06.708 --> 06:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
and get the forever uh date in in the in
 
06:44:08.430 --> 06:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
that case all of them would be the same
 
06:44:10.628 --> 06:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
they could all just go to the board so
 
06:44:12.910 --> 06:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question not an
 
06:44:14.708 --> 06:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
attorney but I believe that would be 71
 
06:44:16.990 --> 06:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
B16 that says if there if you discover
 
06:44:19.388 --> 06:44:19.398 align:start position:0%
there's an erroneous or illegal
 
06:44:21.670 --> 06:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
assessment you have 90 days from the
 
06:44:24.110 --> 06:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
date of the final notice of tax as far
 
06:44:25.590 --> 06:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
as the municipalities
 
06:44:28.350 --> 06:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
go I'd have to defer I'm not sure how
 
06:44:30.150 --> 06:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
that would work I don't know of any case
 
06:44:32.430 --> 06:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
where they they can go to the board for
 
06:44:33.510 --> 06:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
someone for something that they
 
06:44:35.350 --> 06:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
essentially did or didn't
 
06:44:39.230 --> 06:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
do in that in a case like
 
06:44:41.468 --> 06:44:41.478 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
06:44:44.070 --> 06:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:44:46.830 --> 06:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is on
 
06:44:49.468 --> 06:44:49.478 align:start position:0%
line seven I see you don't have the bill
 
06:44:51.750 --> 06:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
but I guess I'll read it it says but the
 
06:44:54.270 --> 06:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
board shall not order retroactive
 
06:44:57.830 --> 06:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
reappraisals outside of and this is what
 
06:45:00.468 --> 06:45:00.478 align:start position:0%
I need clarification on the years in
 
06:45:03.070 --> 06:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
question is that on some application is
 
06:45:06.190 --> 06:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
it on some kind of a complaint H how is
 
06:45:09.030 --> 06:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
the years in question determined and by
 
06:45:12.868 --> 06:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
whom thank you well the when you appeal
 
06:45:14.708 --> 06:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
to the board you you have to cite which
 
06:45:17.750 --> 06:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
year you're appealing so for example in
 
06:45:19.190 --> 06:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
the in the case where if I were
 
06:45:21.270 --> 06:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
appealing my neighbors I would say I
 
06:45:24.110 --> 06:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
have 90 days from the 2023 tax bill
 
06:45:26.788 --> 06:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
issue so I would be appealing the 20
 
06:45:30.628 --> 06:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
2023 taxes within 90 days of that date
 
06:45:34.388 --> 06:45:34.398 align:start position:0%
if I were appealing my taxes I would
 
06:45:37.628 --> 06:45:37.638 align:start position:0%
have to cite the year in question and so
 
06:45:39.430 --> 06:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
vtla and they they may be able to expand
 
06:45:41.548 --> 06:45:41.558 align:start position:0%
on this more but they have you know
 
06:45:42.990 --> 06:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
their their dockets are the year of
 
06:45:45.628 --> 06:45:45.638 align:start position:0%
appeal and then there's docket number so
 
06:45:48.388 --> 06:45:48.398 align:start position:0%
that's it's it's
 
06:45:52.388 --> 06:45:52.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:55.868 --> 06:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
