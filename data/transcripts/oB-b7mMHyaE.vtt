00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
question representative uh it it is uh
 
00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
the dark the uh bolded areas are what's
 
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
being added to what was uh uh what was
 
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
passed so that that's all the Bold areas
 
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
are what's different from what was
 
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.150 align:start position:0%
are what's different from what was
originally

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
passed so mik my question I I think you
 
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
know my concern is um the cons the the
 
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
other um
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
issues related to the child's
 
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
proceedings um so I do have some
 
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
concerns over that yeah yeah I thank you
 
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madam chair I I uh I
 
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
believe the substantively related uh to
 
00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
the child's delinquency I I think we may
 
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
need to um identify what those are uh
 
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
because it does open it up to a wide
 
00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 align:start position:0%
range you know you know we we spoke of
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
the um example of I'm I'm the juvenile I
 
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 align:start position:0%
I punched the kid at my school and they
 
00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
lost the tooth and I'm in civil court
 
00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
for uh paying for the tooth
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we want the state to
 
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
be paying for the attorney in that civil
 
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
suit so right so yeah I would agree that
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe a more of a definition of
 
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.350 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe a more of a definition of
what

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 align:start position:0%

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.509 align:start position:0%

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
please so my name is Michael skibby um

I'm from the disability rights Center of

New Hampshire
 
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
um with regard to this bill um we are
 
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
part of a coalition of organizations
 
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
that have advocated over the years for
 
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
reform of the juvenile justice system in
 
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire other members include the
 
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
youth law project of New Hampshire legal
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
assistance the ACLU new Futures and
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
Waypoint the purpose of this bill is to
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
improve the legal representation of
 
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
children in the delinquency system in
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
several ways first through protecting
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
their right to counsel during police
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
questioning secondly through making the
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
appointment of councel earlier in the
 
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
process third through ensuring that the
 
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
involvement of council continues until
 
00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
the Court's Jurisdiction has concluded
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
and then fourth ensuring that Council
 
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
can protect the child's interests when
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
there are multiple proceedings going on
 
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
at the same time with regard to the
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
conduct that the child is charged with
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
um obviously this bill concerns those
 
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable in our court system
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
that's true of all children but children
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
who are court involved have a very high
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
level of disability as compared to the
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
population at large and they're often
 
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
from families that are dealing with many
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
challenges including poverty that sort
 
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
of put the family and the child at
 
00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
greater risk um in the court system and
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
elsewhere it's important that these
 
00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
children receive the assistance they
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
need to be able to navigate the system
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
that could result in the loss or
 
00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
restriction of their Liberty we have a
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
system that rightly or wrongly has
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
imposed the adversarial nature of the
 
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
adult criminal justice system on the
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system with all of its
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
advantages and disadvantages for an
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
adversarial system to work as designed
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
both sides have to must have the ability
 
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
and resources necessary to gather
 
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
evidence make presentations to the court
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
challenge inaccurate or improperly um
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
collected information um and in the case
 
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
of a child in the juvenile justice
 
00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
system to raise challenges to whether
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
the rules are really being followed um
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
itself um in our system that requires
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
the assistance of competent councel
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
throughout the proceedings if I think
 
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
the result of this legislation will be
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
Improv fairness in the system better
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
confidence in the results of that system
 
00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
and a better alignment of services and
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
interventions with the actual needs of
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
Children and Families and along the
 
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
lines I think it will be a better use of
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
limited public resources this
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislation like last year's legislation
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
follows the publication of an extensive
 
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 align:start position:0%
report um by the national juvenile
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
Defender Center on the uh system for
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
providing represent representation to
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire National
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
experts conducted a comprehensive review
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
of our system and made a variety of
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations to bring it up to the
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
standards necessary to make the system
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
fair for our
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
children uh last year there was a
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
another bill House Bill 188 and I don't
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
want to truncate your consideration but
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
I thought it would be helpful today to
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
focus in on those things that are
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
different from what you U what you
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
approved of last year um and that is why
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
I prepared the table that is before you
 
00:07:58.149 --> 00:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
on the left is the the sections of
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
today's Bill and on the right are the
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
corresponding sections um in last year's
 
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
bill um I think that um hopefully it
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
will allow you to focus on those issues
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
that resulted in last year's bill being
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
placed on the table and then eventually
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
dying um on the table um I think that
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
the the modifications that we made this
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
year have addressed most if not all of
 
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
the ISS I don't think they've addressed
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
all the issues but they've addressed
 
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:25.879 align:start position:0%
most of the issues that were the focus
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
of that floor action um so if you look
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
at the table you'll see
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
that um starting at the top that um the
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
determination of financial ability to
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
pay um has been um has been modified so
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
that the existing requirement that a
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer be appointed immediately upon the
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
case beginning is not delayed by this
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
process that the courts go through to to
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
see if someone can afford Council so it
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
basically says to the court go ahead and
 
00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
appoint counsel you can deal with the
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
ability to pay later and then make an
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment if necessary and so that's
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's similar to a corresponding
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
section that we had last year um in the
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
the second part of section one of this
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
bill um also requires that a that a
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer remain available to the child
 
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
while the court has jurisdiction over
 
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
the child it's that's that's very
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
similar to a section that we had in 188
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
last year there was one limitation that
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
the drafters last year put in there
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
saying that although not in situations
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
where the only remaining issue involves
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
the payment of fin or
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
restitution I think that um as long as
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
the court has jurisdiction over the
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
child I think that a child that a child
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
should be able to reach out to the
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer and ask for assistance in any
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
ongoing Court proceedings regardless of
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
what they may uh deal with because they
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
could conceivably result in an extension
 
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
of jurisdiction probation or some uh
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
um this um this section also deals with
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
the question that you had uh Madam chair
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
about when someone can when a lawyer for
 
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
a child can be involved in related
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
proceedings and th this is pretty
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
significantly changed last year it it
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
was the language was when um when such
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
matters are based on the same factual
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances as the petition without
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
any requirement that there be a
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
necessity that involvement in those
 
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.710 align:start position:0%
necessity that involvement in those
other

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
proceedings is required to to
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
appropriately represent the child in the
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
juvenile proceedings so that I think
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
last year's language did raise the
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
question understandably that if there's
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
a a lawsuit for money damages that
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
arises out of a fight and a lost tooth
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
is it appropriate really for that lawyer
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
to become involved in that civil suit
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
for damages what this what this language
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
is doing is is emphasizing that there
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
must be some Nexus between that other
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding so that it's involvement in
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
some way and maybe only showing up and
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
telling the child not to talk about what
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
happened while the other case is pending
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
for example or it may involve you know
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
observing someone else's testimony about
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
the same the same transaction so that
 
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
you can better prepare for the juvenile
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
case there needs to be that kind of
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
Nexus under the language that is in the
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
bill before you and Michelle wangren who
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
is from thehab your legal assistance
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
will talk in more detail about the
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
related proceedings uh provisions
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
um section two talks about protections
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
against the use of statements by
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
children to police officers or those who
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
are working closely with police officers
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
such as school officials investigating
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
something that happened at the school it
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
limits the availability of the results
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
of those kinds of questioning
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances against a child when they
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
don't have access to counsel now last
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
year there was a similar Pro a similar
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
um uh provision but it was much more
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
unlimited than this one is this is
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
basically focused on questioning by
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
police or those who are working closely
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
with the police under circumstances
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
where a child believes that they have to
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
respond to questions or that they're not
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
free to leave and that's the language in
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill now last year it
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
was much more wide- ranging it basically
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
said any question any statement by a
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
child regardless of who it was made to
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
what the circumstances were whether the
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
child felt as though they had to speak
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
or not so this is Much More Much More
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
constrained and much more focused on the
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
problem that that always exists when
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
someone who is
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um is confronted with an
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
authority authority figure particularly
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
a police officer um and uh asked to
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
respond to questions so that's a
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
significant change um section three is
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
essentially identical to last year which
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
involves removing the obligation to
 
00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
repay the cost of appointed counsel um
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
the remaining sections also address the
 
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
same thing although it sort of picks up
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
some related uh Provisions that are
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
sprinkled throughout uh our statute to
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that that it's clear that the
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
bill as a whole is removing the
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
obligation to repay the cost to counsel
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
by a child or their family
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
so I hope that that is helpful in terms
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
of allowing you to focus on the
 
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
distinctions between last year's Bill
 
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
and this year's bill I think I would
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
just want to spend a moment or two more
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
on the issue of uh the questioning uh by
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
police officers in section two um so
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
obviously you know we're talking about
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
children um uh in encounters with
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
authority figures now our law for more
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
than half a century has recognized that
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
even adults have a difficult time
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with the inherently coercive
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
nature of police interrogation and
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
that's why we have the Miranda warnings
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
that have been part of our law since the
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
1960s um you know police uh fully
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
capable adults it need to be warned that
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
they have a right to uh remain silent
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
and to ask for a lawyer regardless of
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
whether they're children or have
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities in the case of children
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
obviously um you know it goes uh I think
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's common sense and it also the
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
research also shows that children are
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
much more susceptible to police
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
interrogation tactics than adults
 
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
they're inherently less equipped to
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
resist the demands of an authority
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
figure children by their nature are more
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
focused on short-term reward rather than
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
long-term consequences
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
any of us who are parents can recognize
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
that and based on our experience of
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with children's Behavior this
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
would have impacts to judicial processes
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
we would ask that the effective date be
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
modified to January 1
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
2022 um and then finally just with again
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
with regard to section two um and this
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
is not a a position on the bill but
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
simply an observation that if Council
 
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be appointed through this
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
process of the law en enforcement filing
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
a petition that would not be available
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh nights weekends or holidays it's a
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
it's a during the day uh type of
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
petition um and then as also as noted in
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal fiscal note for the judicial
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
councel there is
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
a significant shortage of council these
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
days um and I'm not sure how this would
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
play into the availability of council to
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
perform these duties um but again we
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a position on it but simply
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
an observation relative to both when
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
these petitions would be ruled upon how
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
quickly they might get ruled upon and
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
the availability of council with that
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions if
 
00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:44.839 align:start position:0%
anyone has any great thank you any
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
wangren from the new Hampshire legal
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
assistance to speak in support of the
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
bill and she's asked for 10
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
minutes hi hi good morning honorable
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the commission
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
committee um so as attorney Skiby um
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
said earlier I have a couple of things
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
that I would like to address really
 
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
focusing in on a couple of different
 
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
areas of the bill um as most of you know
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
I was involved in HB 188 last year and
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
provided extensive testimony at that
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
time in support of the bill as well and
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
we hope that the Amendments that um 1465
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
make address many of the concerns that
 
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
the committee had or not so much the
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee but the full house had last
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
year um as all of you likely remember
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
this committee actually passed um 188
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
out with an aut toass recommendation and
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
then there were concerns raised on the
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
floor so we're really hoping that these
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
amendments get to those concerns and I'm
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
happy to run through through some
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
specifics on how I think that they do um
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
so first of all I just want to focus in
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
on part um 1A of section one that
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
discusses the representation at
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
ancillary proceedings and postd
 
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.750 align:start position:0%
ancillary proceedings and postd
dispositional

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
dispositional
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
representation um I'll start by honing
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
in on that post-d dispositional
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
representation and the continuity of
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
council throughout the the life of a
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
juvenile delinquency case um we think
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
that that is just simply good policy
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's something that when the pandemic
 
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
hit uh there were many Advocates who
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
were very concerned that after a child
 
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.350 align:start position:0%
were very concerned that after a child
is

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
um receives a disposition or a sentence
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
in a juvenile proceeding they could be
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
returned to home or they could be placed
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
out of home and typically what happens
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
in those cases is that their defense
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
attorney will close their case and then
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
may reopen it 30 days before their next
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
hearing and during that time they're
 
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
without represent ation so when the
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit um there were a lot of
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
folks who were very concerned that
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
children who were in out of home
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
placements um and not having access to
 
00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:42.919 align:start position:0%
home visits or um you know other other
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
um contact with life outside of these
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
placements that they needed an advocate
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
and this was really widely agreed upon
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
by um the judicial Council and by um
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys and prosecutors and so
 
00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
everyone just sort of agreed that yes it
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
makes sense to allow postd dispositional
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
advocacy for these kids and that their
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
um their attorneys should remain in
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
place throughout the life of at least
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
their out of home placement um we think
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
that makes sense for a number of reasons
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
um at these placements kids are um wi
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
without their family without their
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
friends without eyes on them there are
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
Staffing shortages we have very very
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
high rates of restraint seclusion in
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
these facilities um as a an education
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
practitioner what I often um encounter
 
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
is kids um who have IEPs or special
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
education services and then they wind up
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
in a placement and those placements
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
don't offer their special education
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
services so those those services are
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
simply removed from their IEPs with no
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
oversight or thought about why they
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
needed those services in the first place
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
there's nobody to go back to court and
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
say hey this is an inappropriate
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
placement because this child is losing
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
access to the Serv services that their
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
team has determined that they need so
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
for all of those reasons we think it's
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
just very bad practice to leave kids out
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
of home and without access to Advocates
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
and counsel um but those concerns first
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
of all don't stop when the pandemic ends
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
we think that this this is a practice
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
that has been adopted already during the
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
pandemic but we think needs to continue
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
beyond the pandemic because these kids
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
still have those same concerns the
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
issues that I just raised regarding
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
special education planning um and other
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
services and restraints of seclusion
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
those were problems before the pandemic
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
um but we also think that kids um kids
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
who are not in out of home placement
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
also need access to counsel all of these
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
kids when they are sentenced to um
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
probation or any any term of services
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
that is part of a larger case plan and
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's very important that they have
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
access to the services that they need um
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
through their delinquency case so that
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
they don't wind up in these out of home
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
placements and so if they're not
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
receiving the counseling and services
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
that the court has ordered or something
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
is going wrong in their um in their in
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
their service plan while even in their
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
homes they should have access to counsel
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
so that they don't wind up at the next
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
court hearings with their probation
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
officer saying that you know they're not
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
accessing counseling or they're doing
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
something wrong and therefore they need
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
to be placed out of home if they're not
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
receiving something or they're
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
struggling they should have access to a
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
council to council well beyond that all
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
already um Council reopens their case
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
before hearing so all this would do is
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
have the juvenile know that even though
 
00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
they don't have a hearing coming up in
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
30 days they have a hearing coming up in
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
60 days they can pick up the phone and
 
00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:42.919 align:start position:0%
call their counsel we do not think that
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
this will create an added burden on um
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
on the public defender system
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
because already they're sort of
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
scrambling to catch up 30 days before a
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
hearing so we think that this just makes
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
sense um in terms of of the second part
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
of 1A and section one which is I think
 
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
what the committee um has really
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
expressed concerns on about we think
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
that this provision is really
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
substantially different from what you
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
saw last year so as attorney skibby um
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
indicated last year HB 188 allowed for
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
um for representation by Council
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
ancillary proceedings anytime um those
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
proceedings had the same underlying
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
factual circumstances so it could mean
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
representation uh we didn't think that
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
it would mean this but you know I think
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
the committee pointed out it could mean
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
representation at a personal injury on a
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
personal injury claim it could mean
 
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
representation at a school proceeding
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's not how we intended it and um we
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
had a number of conversations with
 
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and really um tried to
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
understand what the concerns were and so
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
from from our perspective here um there
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
is a New Hampshire rule professional
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
conduct for attorneys and it's Rule
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
1.1a and that rule says um it requires
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
lawyers to conduct proper case repres
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
preparation it includes inquiry inter
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
into an analysis of factual and legal
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
elements of the case and use of methods
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
and procedures meeting the standards of
 
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.590 align:start position:0%
and procedures meeting the standards of
competent

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
competent
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners notably the njdc report
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
that attorney scabby pointed out found
 
00:23:26.269 --> 00:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire attorneys
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
underutilize investigator to adequately
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
prepare cases so what we intended this
 
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
provision to mean um both last year and
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
now even more so this year is that if an
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
attorney decides that participation
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
whatever participation means it and it
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to mean full representation
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
but if an attorney decides that
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
participation in something other than
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
that child's delinquency court case is
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to prepare their case um and
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
represent them in the delinquency
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
proceeding then they should have the
 
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
freedom to do that and we simply think
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's what the rules of professional
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
conduct require so there's all kind a
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
school disciplinary hearing so if if a
 
00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:15.799 align:start position:0%
if a child's underlying offense is based
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
on an assault that happened at school
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that child is also undergoing a
 
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
suspension or expulsion for that assault
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
there will be witnesses that
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
entails um
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
and the only the only real example that
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
I can think of is that if a violation of
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
conditional release is based
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
on an underlying action like a
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
suspension or
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
expulsion defeating that would
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily defeat the violation of
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
conditional release and that would be
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
necessary participation I can't think of
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
any other type of representation and I
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
don't think that means that it doesn't
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
exist but I can't think of any other
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
type of legal
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
representation that would be necessary
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
to effectively represent the child in
 
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
the delinquency case I can think of
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
advocacy that may be necessary I can
 
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
think of information gathering and
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
investigation that may be
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
necessary um but I think that by having
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
the reasonably necessary language in
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
there it limits
 
00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
it adequately limits what an attorney
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
can do and certainly support this but
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
quote we support this bill in concept
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
and recommend further study uh regarding
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note I'm sure later today uh
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me later in this hearing you'll
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
hear from dcyf who um um agree uh that
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
this is a systemwide change that needs
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
to happen but needs to be divulged into
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
regarding some crimes just to kind of
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
put this into perspective a waiver can
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
be asked from the defense attorney uh
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a fail safe but uh they may
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
or may or not the judge may or may not
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
approve that and still a child excuse me
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
young adult uh may be tried as an adult
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
so there are those checks and balances
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
that kind of create that that that again
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
like I said fail safe um the takeaway
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
from this is that this is needed um but
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
again we need to investigate this
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
further um as to the best way to move
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
forward to implement
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
this and I'm with that I'll be happy to
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
take any questions so are you suggesting
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
we turn this into some sort of a study
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee absolutely not that's a that's
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
a safe way to say that this bill is is
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
dead um I'm thinking something along
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
some form of professional commission um
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
that um professionals including law
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials um DCF members of
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh this body and the Senate um as well
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
um get together and have some form of
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
Brain Trust if you
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
will so are you suggesting we amend this
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
to make it a commission I am not
 
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting that at this time as I want
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
to get uh people together to see what we
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
can come forward with and and find the
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
best solution
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
forward okay thank you are there any
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
yela so you're asking the committee to
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
nope for a
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
followup thank
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
you what is you your request of this
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
unclear okay are there any further
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
much up next is Richard headed from the
 
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
Richard HED I'm the judicial branches
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
government Affairs coordinator um and
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying on the assumption that
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
this bill would be going forward and not
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
relative to the policies but some of the
 
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:28.519 align:start position:0%
concerns the judicial branch has
 
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:30.039 align:start position:0%
regarding the implementation of this
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
type of a bill if it were to go forward
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
in its current form there are roughly um
 
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.630 align:start position:0%
in its current form there are roughly um
uh

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
4700 um people who are currently in the
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
in the system that are aged 18 to 21
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
that would become juveniles under this
 
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
bill um about 655 of those are in
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
Superior Court a little over 4,000 of
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
those are in the Circuit Court um so the
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
implementation of this type of of a bill
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
would require us to treat those
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
individuals as juveniles so for example
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
part of the requirements of the Court
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
could be includes placement while
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
arraignment is being determined the
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
question is exactly where do you place a
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
20-year-old who would be subject to this
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
bill but would be considered a juvenile
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
you know it's unclear as to where
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
exactly we would be able to place those
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
individuals in terms of the process
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
juvenile cases are much more complex in
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
an earlier analysis that we had
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
performed um juvenile cases take about
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
14 times longer than other cases has a
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
significant impact on a court system
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's dealing with um
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
125,000 cases in the circuit court with
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
41 judges when you add that type of an
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
additional time uh requirement to cases
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
you're imposing a significant burden on
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
on the traditional Branch there also
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
just more more complex in terms of the
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
analysis that's required um so for
 
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
example during arraignments the court
 
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
has to evaluate the cognitive ability of
 
00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919 align:start position:0%
the individual the mental emotional
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
behavioral disorders special education
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility um and previous management
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
referrals that may have occurred with
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
this individual they're treated as
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
juveniles they're treated as a a
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
different um uh it's much different
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
analysis than for an adult in addition
 
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
there are requirements relative to
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
involving the parent or Guardians when
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an 181 19 20 21 year
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
old um we're not usually involving we we
 
00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:36.519 align:start position:0%
usually don't have a situation where
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
there's a parent and typically Guardians
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
are no longer involved so it becomes
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
very unclear as to how the court manages
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
parents and Guardians in terms of the
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
current language of the
 
00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.870 align:start position:0%
current language of the
statute

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
um so just as an overall sort of concern
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch this type of of a
 
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.789 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch this type of of a
change

00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:57.799 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
would would create a significant burden
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
especially in the circuit courts
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
especially in um conquered Manchester
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
nashille and Keen where we have the
 
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
heaviest criminal loads um and and we
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
would see that there would be a need for
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
certainly additional Personnel in terms
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
of clerk management of these types of
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
cases and judicial resources um with
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
that I'll be happy to answer any
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have thank
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
much so I I have a quick question so
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
where would we house said 14 year olds
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
would we house them with 20 year olds
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
it's at least unclear from the bill it
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't address that current currently
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
that's obviously a concern um and uh in
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
exactly how you you'd be placing folks
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
who are for all other purposes adults
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
into a juvenile situation is is unclear
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
to us in terms of of how that would
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
proceed and and could you please give me
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
the numbers again that you stated for
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
how many we currently have 18 to 20 year
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
olds sure um currently in the in terms
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
of criminal cases there are
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
4,688 cases of those a little over 4,000
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
Court okay thank you very much are there
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your time up next is
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards to speak in
 
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill he's asked for
 
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill he's asked for
three

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.269 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
on on there oh there we go they're right
 
00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
around here got it yeah um okay so thank
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I appreciate the
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come speak before your
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee um I I know that one of your
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
committee members two of your committee
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
members are U sponsors of this bill and
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
I I don't mean to denigrate their their
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
work at all uh I am uh opposed to this
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill and I'll I'll try to
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
explain why I I I haven't done the
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
detailed analysis that the previous
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
witness did so I'm I I my concerns are
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
more at sort of a strategic uh you know
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh concern level of of we don't know
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
what we don't know uh kind of thing and
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh I would just say that um I had posted
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
that this bill was going to be heard
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
today on our local community political
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
board and it created a lot of
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
um interest and I'm surprised folks from
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
Auburn aren't here today because they
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
seem pretty animated but I I think I'm
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of uh my constituents
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
Auburn Chester and Sandown that they
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
don't think this is a good idea um as we
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the maturity level and the
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
decision- making ability of young people
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I I I just want to establish the
 
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
Benchmark that this legislature has said
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
that 13year olds in law 13-year-olds are
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
mature enough and have the
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking authority enough for them
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
to begin undergoing gender reassignment
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
surgery which is a pretty tremendous
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
decision at the age of 13 they're also
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
able to elect to have an abortion
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
without parental notification so we've
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
already in law said that this age group
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
has a tremendous amount of ability to
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
make incredibly important uh life
 
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.109 align:start position:0%
make incredibly important uh life
changing

00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
decisions uh we have recently as a house
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
passed HB
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
254 uh which if it becomes law would
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
essentially say that only those uh
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
juveniles who are have been convicted of
 
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
a a serious physical crime not property
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
crimes we would exempt property crimes
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
from being detained in uh the sununu
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
youth center and its replacement so I I
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious ious if we'd be adding
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
the 18 to 20y Old category to those that
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
would also now be green light to commit
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
property crime and and and if that's the
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
case uh I think as we look at TV and we
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
see the Looting taking the organized
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
looting that's taking place around the
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
country I I just I just don't want that
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire I law might from
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
an unintended perspective tell um a
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
mature group of people who have access
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
to cars and mobility and everything that
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
they can just that uh New Hampshire is a
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
u open hunting season um I I I think if
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
we look at our experience with bail
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
reform in the last few years what we'll
 
00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:47.079 align:start position:0%
see is that uh the the legislature had a
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
pretty good intent for bail reform and
 
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
um the judges have not implemented our
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
intent particularly well we've seen a
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
great deal more leniency in the bail
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
reform than what we had anticipated and
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
there are several initiatives to try to
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
tighten that back up and make it more
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
clear but U but I'm just concerned about
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh having our judges given more and more
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
discretion in this particular area when
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
I think they've not done a good job with
 
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
u managing bail reform as a re very
 
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
recent example um I would point out that
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
we've said that we're going to close
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
Center and replace it and none of the
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
sizing of that facility has been based
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
on adding some subset of 4,000 cases a
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
year so our whole sununu Center plan uh
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
would just go be going back to square
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
zero I guess um and then I'd also say
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
that we've spent a lot of money in the
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
last few years establishing a system of
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
care which basically provides
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
community-based resources to those uh in
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
need and and I think um uh and I think
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
this is I I don't know this for a fact
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
but as I understand it um in order for
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
the cunu center to close we need to
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
really rely on the cunu center to
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
provide system of care support to people
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
probably on a priority basis of some
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
kind uh and so all of a sudden we're I'm
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering are we going to take
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
these 18 to 20 year olds and and now
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
give them priority for system of care
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
services because they've committed a
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
crime and their brother or sister did
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
I um you can do it politely but this I
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't think this is good uh good policy
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
so I I'm happy to take questions I I'm
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
not as deep on this as other Witnesses
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
but I'm W I'm willing to
 
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
try so
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
um you're you're a veteran right I am
 
00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
who so at what age um can kids can
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
people join the military uh I I think
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
under the current uh policies they can
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh sign up with their parental approval
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
at uh 17 uh they can do it completely on
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
their own at 18 uh and uh just to
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that uh I I when I served
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
in Afghanistan uh I I did meet young
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
people and uh they were there handling
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
extremely serious responsibilities on
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
behalf of their
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
nation and would you say that that is
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
not a decision that is made
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
lightly uh the decision to enter into
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
the military uh I I wouldn't say it's a
 
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
light decision no thank you yeah any
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing none thank you
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
so much all right thank you for your
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
time up next is um representative Mary
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
Beth walls speak in support of the bill
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
minute thank you Madame chairman members
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm represented of Mary
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
Beth walls I represent mayor Matt County
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
District 23 which is Bow and Dunbarton
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and I was for or am a former chair of
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
this committee and while on this
 
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
committee and as chair I actually had
 
00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
the bill that raised the age of
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
delinquency from 16 to 18 which is why I
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
wandered in today I'm break from
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
education across the hall and wanted to
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
see what was happening here I'm under no
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
illusions that this bill is going to
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
pass as it is you know it was tough to
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
get it to 18 we faced a lot of
 
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
opposition and we left Major Crimes down
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
at 16 where um children between the ages
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
of 16 and 18 could be certified of as an
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
adult if they did commit something like
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
murder so we understood this is going on
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring a couple things to the
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
attention of the committee one is is
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
that um Nebraska actually is the only
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
state in the Union I know of that has an
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
age of delinquency above 18 and they're
 
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:05.079 align:start position:0%
at 19 so it's possible to do it and
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
change happens incrementally and I would
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to look at
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
doing it to 19 or 20 and no doubt we're
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
hearing testimony there are
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
complications for raising the age at all
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
um and I will bring some of them up for
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
your attention one is Pria the prison
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
rape elimination act which says you
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
cannot hold 18 19 20 year olds the same
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
facility as those under 18 okay no doubt
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
that would complicate things here in how
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
we hold um these people I also wanted to
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
just reference represent the prior
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
witness's testimony he talked about
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
4,000 cases in cunu that was 4,000 cases
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
in the courts not 4,000 people
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and I just didn't want to
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
complate that data you know I'm sure the
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
vast majority of those 4,000 cases that
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
they were testifying about in the court
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
are misdemeanors without any sort of
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
jail time or any sort of incarceration
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
associated with them so understand that
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
the burden on the court of 4,000 cases
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
is totally separate from whatever burden
 
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
will arise due to incarceration of
 
00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
somebody on one of these um so I just
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to to make sure that that was
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
clear to the committee as well so I
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to turn this into a
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
study committee or commission or
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
something along the way to look at this
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
at the time I worked to raise the age of
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
delinquency to 18 I would love to have
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
taken it even to want I was no fool I
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
knew that wasn't going to happen just
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
getting it at 18 was a very heavy lift
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a valid concern that
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
warrants examination there's no doubt
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's a vast difference in maturity of
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
18 19 20 21 year olds some are very
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
mature they're going to go over to
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan and do very major things
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
there are others that are just
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
constantly making bad decisions and
 
00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
their lack of brain development shows
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
every day and I think it's possible to
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
thread the needle to come up with
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
something that recognizes that it's not
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
a one-size fits-all that there is a
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
difference in maturity and that there
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
are some juveniles there are some young
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
adults that need our support in ways
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
that others don't thank you very much
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any questions
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much thank you
 
00:42:21.069 --> 00:42:21.079 align:start position:0%
and the last speaker is um director Joe
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
ripsom of dcyf to speak for three
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:32.950 align:start position:0%
ripsom of dcyf to speak for three
minutes

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
Joe ripson director DCF great to see
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
everybody today um I only signed in to
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
provide information um we do have
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
obviously many many implementation
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
concerns with something like this moving
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
forward as written right if you're
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
talking about a potential of 4,700
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
additional individuals entering the
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system without you know
 
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
preparation Ado so that would be really
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
really difficult what I did want to say
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
though is that that you know we do know
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
a lot about brain signs with adolescence
 
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
at this point that wasn't known years
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
ago we know that while the intellectual
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
maturity for most young people is age 16
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
their social emotional maturity maturity
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
and their executive function doesn't
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
fully develop until they're in their mid
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
20s certainly not suggesting that the
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
law should change to to make it in the
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
mid 20s just to say that I think this is
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
a reasonable um issue for folks to take
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
seriously around how do we make sure
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
that we're addressing people's needs in
 
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
a meaningful and thoughtful way um that
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
understands kind of their their maturity
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
level their decision- making their
 
00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:33.079 align:start position:0%
intellectual capacity and doesn't
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a one- siiz fits-all um
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
I do not think that the way that this is
 
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
drafted which would just change the age
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
to 21 does that but I do think it's
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
something that's worth the examination
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
of folks and I do appreciate
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing forward this
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
idea that this is something that New
 
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should start thinking about
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
and figuring out of approach to make
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
sure that we treat young adults in a way
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
that matches with their intellectual um
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
maturity and developmental realities and
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions are there
 
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.349 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions are there
any

00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
you good morning I'm representative
 
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
Cornell Manchester yeah pull it a little
 
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
closer representing district 18 and I'm
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
also on the education committee I'm
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
introducing Bill 1531 today which would
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
modifies the duty scope and membership
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
of the oversight Commission on um
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
Children's Services it's in the office
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate um it's RSA
 
00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:25.910 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate um it's RSA
21-v

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
21-v
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
and what this does is overlooks the
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
programs um the
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
agencies the practices to make sure that
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
um our children are being cared for the
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
agencies are doing what they're supposed
 
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
to be doing so this bill is to modify
 
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
that commission update it the office of
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
child advocate I believe is going
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
through some changes on fortunately the
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
child advocate is leaving and so um that
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
will be under New Direction they'll be
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
doing new things so this is to try and
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
keep up with that um this bill is a work
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
in progress I I believe you're going to
 
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:07.799 align:start position:0%
hear of different ideas and this is just
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
to really get the ball
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
going okay are there any questions for
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell representative
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
yella yes thank you and thank you for
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
taking the question um pleasure so this
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
is repealing the entire statute and and
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
reenacting it what what are the the uh I
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
guess deficiencies that you're seeing or
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
that that you see that that warrants uh
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
a re a whole redesign of the statute and
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
I I think some of the things that it's
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
overseen aren't in place anymore or
 
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
their scope and Mission have changed um
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
I think the membership of the commission
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
um could do some changes for different
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
people different agencies to do that so
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's just an update and
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
review any further
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
you and up next is um Senator Whitley to
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%

minutes thank you Madame chair good
 
00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:22.039 align:start position:0%
afternoon good morning members of the
 
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Becky Whitley I
 
00:56:26.109 --> 00:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
represent Senate district 15 including
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
conquered hener hopkington and Warner
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
and I'm really pleased to be in front of
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
this committee I care deeply about
 
00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:34.839 align:start position:0%
children and families and um want to
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
speak in support of Representative
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
Cornell's bill um just wanted to clarify
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
representative yella that the bill
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't repeal the entire statute it
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
really just focuses on the oversight
 
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
commission um and uh retains a lot of
 
00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
their work but sort of rethinks its role
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
and so I wanted to point out to that um
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
um representative Cornell and I and
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
others fully recognize that the office
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
of child advocate is actually going
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
through a very um in-depth strategic
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
planning process and part of that work
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
and um I'm sure the child advocate can
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
speak to this part of their work is
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
really looking at the role of the
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
commission um as the office has evolved
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
and I um uh we are uh working to convene
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
a work group with the office of child
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
advocate with um rep uh with
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
representative rice with representative
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
Cornell and Sharon Carson who's the
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
chair of the oversight commission and
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
then other Advocates to make sure we're
 
00:57:34.349 --> 00:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
aligning uh the work that the strategic
 
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
planning process is undertaking and also
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
streamline um some of our work as a
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
legislature to look at Children's
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
Services there are lots of committees
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
well- meaning trying to look at system
 
00:57:47.789 --> 00:57:47.799 align:start position:0%
issues and I think when we're talking
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
about children it's really important
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we are are um looking about our uh
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
our system as a whole and making sure
 
00:57:56.109 --> 00:57:56.119 align:start position:0%
it's efficient making sure kids are
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
getting timely care families are
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
supported when they need to um so this
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
is an effort to to streamline those
 
00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
efforts um I agree that it is a work in
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
progress this is just something to get
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
on paper to work from and there there is
 
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
a strong working group that's going to
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
be continuing to look at this work and
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
align it with the um oca's strategic
 
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:15.640 align:start position:0%

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
do what do you think that um maybe the
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
current thing that this um commission is
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
is doing NE that that needs to be
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
updated is it um need a broader scope is
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
it is it too broad and we need to focus
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
its efforts um or are we not sure and
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
we're still waiting for um um this this
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
plan to be formed thank you yeah thank
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
you for the question I think when the
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
statute so the statute was passed and
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
then it was then it evolved as the child
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
advocate built out her office um and now
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
I think um many years into the office
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
it's been what four years since the
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
office was established I think it's a
 
00:59:27.029 --> 00:59:27.039 align:start position:0%
perfect time to look at the role of the
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
commission and so I wouldn't say it's
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know it's changing it a lot or
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
improving it I think it's just
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
reimagining how we can um play a part in
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
that oversight mechanism and work
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
alongside the office of child advocate
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
so I think there's also some thought
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
about um there are existing commissions
 
00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
that work really well and there um I
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if folks are familiar with
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
the governor's uh uh drug uh I don't
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
know what it's called but the um
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
Commission on drug oversight and they
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
have many tasks for and so the way that
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
this was designed was to sort of mimic
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
that that that commission to sort of
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
think through you know different task
 
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
force to achieve uh the system work and
 
01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's the other piece to it
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
since the commission was set up and the
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate has been set up
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
there has been a lot of system reform so
 
01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
through 135f through this children's
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
system of care the state looks very
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
different we are already delivering
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
services to children in a different way
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
and so we need to evolve in our
 
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
oversight to to match that system reform
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
and have a a continued focus on system
 
01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:28.710 align:start position:0%
and have a a continued focus on system
level

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
work follow up yes yes thank you and
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for your answer um it one
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
of the tasks that are is listed on page
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
two line 30 is to develop a mission and
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
goals and objectives yeah so it seems
 
01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.150 align:start position:0%
goals and objectives yeah so it seems
like

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
um we don't know what we want them to do
 
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
that's for the task forces so we're
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
going to have the commission and then
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps the commission will want to say
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
well we need a task force on children's
 
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and then that task
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
there okay thank you thank you for the
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
you and up next is um Moira O'Neal from
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
the office of the Advocate to speak in
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and she does have
 
01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:37.710 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and she does have
written

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
testimony good morning Madam chair
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak today for the
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
record my name is Moira O'Neal I'm the
 
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
child advocate for the State of New
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and and just uh with
 
01:01:53.069 --> 01:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
regrets that there's only an opportunity
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
to say that you
 
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
can you pull the mic a little closer we
 
01:01:58.589 --> 01:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
have the machines back here that are
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
running so it's it's hard to hear if
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
you're not like right up in the mic is
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
this better yes thank you can you hear
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
me now
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
sorry so um I regret that the the
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
classifications of support for the bill
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
are either support or or or oppose and
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
we we support the concept of this bill
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
um but we oppose it as written um and
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
I'll um uh just re review with you a
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
little bit I I understand that there's
 
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:27.799 align:start position:0%
going to be some work done to make some
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
changes my testimony includes uh many of
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
the areas that we think need to be
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
adjusted so I can go through that
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
testimony now and give you that
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
information or wait until the the group
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
has made more would you like to hear
 
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
more of it now just thinking about the
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
time for the committee that has
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
questions oh I mean we 20 minutes so
 
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
okay sure all right so let as long as
 
01:02:59.470 --> 01:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
you can do it in 20 minutes I I believe
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
I can I believe I can for once I'm not
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
too too lengthy here so the house bill
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
as you've heard it modifies membership
 
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
duties scope of the oversight commission
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
um it also provides an appropriation um
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
for the commission's duties and it was
 
01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
um and and and it's addressing where the
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
commission is at today originally the
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
commission was established along with
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate in
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
response to child tragedies that
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
signaled some need for reforms in New
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire child protective system so and
 
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
as you just heard from Senator Whitley
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
the system is now a very different
 
01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
system um thanks much to that um so so
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's why we cons we we support this
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
bill in terms of that it's a time for a
 
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of change but we do think
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
there's some clarification so the
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
expectation of the office of the child
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
advocate is to ensure
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
transparency examination of State
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
systems performance and Assurance of a
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
system that operates in the best
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
interest of children
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
the role of the current iteration of the
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
commission is in addition to vetting
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
candidates for the child Advocates
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
position is to provide oversight of the
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
office and to collaborate in promoting
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
system improvements and best practices
 
01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
so I think what may have happened in the
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
past four years was that there was a
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
great emphasis on vetting candidates for
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
this position and then the off and then
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
the commission didn't really find its
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
feet and and begin to operate under the
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
statute or perhaps the statute wasn't
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
clear enough for them to find what their
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
role was so this is really timely um
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley mentioned that the
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate is in the
 
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
process right now of finishing up a
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
strategic plan for the next three years
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
um and in that process we collected
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
information from all around the
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
community including oversight commission
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
members because of that really important
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
relationship that's intended to be there
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
um eight members of the commission
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
participated in stakeholder interviews
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
um and we learned that um there were
 
01:04:59.710 --> 01:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
several suggestions and recommendations
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
on how to strengthen that commission um
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
and those themes included increasing
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
role Clarity for the commission
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
considering a broader role for the
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
commission expanding the composition of
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
the commission to include Youth and
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
others there is a position for a youth
 
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
on the commission now that has yet to be
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
filled um and that's new we changed that
 
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
two years ago um but also they want to
 
01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
more closely connect the commission to
 
01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
the actual work with children through
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
site visits um to programs or doing
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
shared case reviews so getting to know
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
more of what's happening in the field
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
and then finally establishing a more
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
frequent and substantive Cadence of
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
meetings and communication because in
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
the last I would say almost two years
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
the the commission really sort of ceased
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
to function in many ways it wasn't
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
meeting and that was that was the
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
feedback we got from Commission members
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
so as you see the input from the
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
commission members who participated in
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
the interviews reflected you know this
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
the what's the changes that are
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
materializing in this bill so it just
 
01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
happens um we we hadn't coordinated that
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
feedback but that was um that's how it
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
it sort of developed so today I
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that several
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill do require um
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
clarification and it's a little
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
bit disc ulating maybe I could say um so
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to talk about
 
01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
changes in four categories one is
 
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
clarifying the administrative head of
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate two is
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
the apparent dual roles and purpose of
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
the proposed commission um membership of
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
the commission and then the fourth is
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
administration of the commission
 
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
including budget management so
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
clarification of the administrative head
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's a small thing but just logistically
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
it could be Troublesome there is no
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
director of the office of the child
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
advocate under RSA 21 V1 section two the
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
child advocate is the administrative
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
head of the office a minor detail but
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
something that could be um could be
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
confusing at some
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
point so the proposed commission appears
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
to have dual roles and purpose so it it
 
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
appears that the roles and purpose for
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
the commission may actually even be in
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
Conflict so specifically in one role it
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
appears the commiss would act somewhat
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
as Children's Services collaborative or
 
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
a cabinet with a role of examining
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
service needs for children as well as
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
available resources to meet those needs
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
but in the other role the commission
 
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
acts as oversight of the office of the
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
child advocate so beginning um on page
 
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
two line 23 and forward the bill
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
establishes capacity within the
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
commission to uh convene task forces as
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley was just talking about
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
to report on available programs funding
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
onet Mees um and later further on um as
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
well as identify program areas where
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
improved coordination is needed then
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
later on page three line four it
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
establishes duties of the commission
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
that include making recommendations
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
regarding creating a unified Statewide
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
administrative uh programs and services
 
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
for children I think this is coming from
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
the discussion in the last session about
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
creating a separate Agency for
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
children's services um which we did
 
01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:24.749 align:start position:0%
children's services um which we did
support

01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
so that all appears to be looking having
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
a role where you're looking at the
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
system and you're making recommendations
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
then alternatively also on page three in
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
line four forward it articulates that
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
the commission's role of oversight of
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate so in
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
this section the examination of delivery
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
of services is described as the offices
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility which the commission
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
oversees and here the potential for
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
conflict exists because it propos
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
proposes that the child advocate be both
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
a member and the executive director of
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
the commission th positioning the office
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
to oversee
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
itself and then and I and I'm sure
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's not intended I think it's just an
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
oversight of combining some ideas
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
there's a further potential conflict in
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
that membership that I'll talk about in
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
a minute includes state agencies that
 
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
under RSA 21 V1 over which the office
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
has oversight so that would be providing
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
oversight of the office so the overseen
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
is overseen and the overse overseas
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
itself and so that just doesn't work and
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
we just have to work that out a lot of
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
overseers going on you wouldn't want
 
01:09:30.719 --> 01:09:32.110 align:start position:0%
overseers going on you wouldn't want
that

01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
codified and I appreciate that people
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
put these things together fast and and
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
language is is complicated but we want
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's pointed out um so the
 
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
commission's further proposed to have a
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
partnership with the office in reviewing
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
services collaborating to identify best
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
practices so that language is in line
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
with the proposed role of service
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
collaborative however it's not inclusive
 
01:09:55.709 --> 01:09:55.719 align:start position:0%
of all the members of the task force so
 
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
there's so in some senses you're going
 
01:09:58.990 --> 01:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
in the right direction and then others
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's overlapping so the question is
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
raised about the intent of the bill and
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
I think that's what needs to be
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
clarified do we want to establish an
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
advisory collaborative for the purpose
 
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
of supporting and collaborating with the
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate examining
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
Services making recommendations impr
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
proving or does the bill establish
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
oversight and support of the office and
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
the child advocate once that purpose is
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
clear do you have a question
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative I'm happy to be
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
interrupted do you want to go ahead go
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah that's yeah go ahead thank
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you um yes I was definitely
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
confused I'm confused um because it
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
seems like they're doing the work and
 
01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
then also trying to oversee the work and
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
so um it seems to me that some of the
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
things that they want to do
 
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
um are outside the scope of the current
 
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
child advocate and um and so that they
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
wanted the opportunity to do that work
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
and they wanted the child advocate to be
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
a part of that process but then they're
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
also um it seems like this this
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
commission is really was formed based on
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
the current RSA is for oversight and um
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
and to collaborate with the office I
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
guess with um
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
implementing the suggestions and methods
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they could do that um you know
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
whether that become legisl U come Lobby
 
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
us or what whatever the case may be but
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
this seems to be changing the the role
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
for more of oversight to doing the work
 
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.790 align:start position:0%
for more of oversight to doing the work
is

01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
that is this really two different
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
commissions and should this is this its
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
own commission that's trying to do the
 
01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.790 align:start position:0%
own commission that's trying to do the
work

01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
for um services like understanding the
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
services and then there's a separate
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
commission that is oversight oversight
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
over the office is that okay so thank
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
you for thank you for that question I as
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
I said it's it's a little
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
discombobulating um you have several
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
questions in there yeah number one it
 
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't address further
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction than the office already has
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
um in September of
 
01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
2020 the office's jurisdiction expanded
 
01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
considerably so RSA 21 um mandates that
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
the child advocate oversee all CH All
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
Children's Services any service that a
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
child is provided that may be um either
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
provided for paid for or arranged for by
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so the so the
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is quite broad um and it's
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
possible that one rationale for a
 
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
commission on children's services um is
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
created to both um help guide advise and
 
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
give some heft to this really broad
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction because uh right now in
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
July of 2022 the office will be up to
 
01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
seven and a half positions um and that's
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
really not necessarily possible to to do
 
01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
all of the systemic things that the
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
office would need to do so it does help
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
and there currently is no advisory body
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
for the office of the child advocate so
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
in that sense it's not a bad idea the
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
question is is it is there also a need
 
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
for oversight of the office um and that
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's a good question to look elsewhere
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
around the country to see do these
 
01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
offices have oversight um in Connecticut
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
where I'm most familiar they did have an
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
advisory council at one point but they
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
abolished it and so most of these
 
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
offices don't actually have oversight
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
because they are so responsible to the
 
01:13:57.629 --> 01:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
public I suppose and also because they
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
do not have enforcement power so they
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
don't so so they're not really in a
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
position to make decisions for the state
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
that that that people would be concerned
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
about in terms of responsibility um and
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
certainly All State a agencies um are
 
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
are responsible to follow the law and
 
01:14:16.629 --> 01:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
and perform their duties the way they
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
need to do Under the Attorney General's
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so so those are questions
 
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
that really need to be teased out little
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit more as we clarify what's
 
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill and how and
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
what would be the most effective and
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
useful um commission or body that's
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
working with or over the office of the
 
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.070 align:start position:0%
working with or over the office of the
child

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
advocate so the answer is uh TBD to be
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
decided do you have a
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
just that's I think I think if we talk
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
after I give you some
 
01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
clarification okay okay so the next
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
section that I wanted to address was
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
membership that's proposed in the bill
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
um there's some changes that are
 
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
proposed um the office identified a few
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
important stakeholders are not included
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
um there are some categories of members
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
that may actually overlap if there's
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
providers or advocacy and then there's
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
other options they may be the same
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
people so you could cut down the number
 
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
of those people in order to replace them
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
with the people we think are important
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
to include um and so I've provided a
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
table that shows those that are proposed
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
in the bill and then the and then what
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
we propose um in an amendment would be
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
to have two fewer child advocacy
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
organizations there'd be two of those
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
one more individual with lived
 
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
experience as a child and and one of the
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
reasons for that is not only because
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
their input is so important but we're
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
finding with young people it's very
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to make themselves available
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
for these kinds of proceedings um and so
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
if you have two you can increase the
 
01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
odds that at least one will participate
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
um the maintain the foster parent um we
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
suggest including an individual who has
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
experience as a parent involved with the
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
system um this is a really important
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
perspective because it gives us their
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
experience and how better to work with
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
them um leave it the one professional
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
provider for legislators from the
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
executive branch and the judicial branch
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General we wouldn't change
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
the Comm commissioner the DCF director
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of children's Behavioral
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
Health director the Medicaid services
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
director Department of Education
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner the office of the child
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
advocate we would remove for the
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
conflicting uh points that we made the
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Developmental Services
 
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
director we would add because
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities is one of the
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
biggest issues that we see being
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
unaddressed right now in New Hampshire
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
um the Circuit Court administrative
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
judges we've added one
 
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
to that to include someone else with
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
expertise um in the court systems um
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
Council on thriving children we left
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
system of care advisory committee this
 
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
is where we thought there would probably
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
be overlap because everyone is a member
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the system advisory committee I think
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
they have about a hundred members and
 
01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
most of the people listed already belong
 
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
to that um a public defender and we
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
added back a chief of police there have
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
been two chiefs of police on the
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
committee on the commission to to date
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
they haven't been entirely engage we
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to a point where we've
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
been able to engage them in the work of
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
the commission as intended and we're
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
constantly seeing that there is a role
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
for police that's implicated in a lot of
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
the system issues that we're finding so
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's important to keep them on the board
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
now having listed all those people the
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
other conflict that I mentioned having
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
um representation on here um would again
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
create them overseeing the agency that
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
over oversees them if that is the
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of the off of the commission to
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
oversee the office of the child advocate
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
and I explain that a little bit further
 
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
through here and then um the last point
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
is administration of the commission
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
including budget management so there's
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
an allocation of
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
$150,000 um it and it also includes that
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
the administration of this committee um
 
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
would um would be fall under the child
 
01:18:23.229 --> 01:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
advocate being the executive director so
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
if the oversight role of the commission
 
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
is altered and the purpose of the
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
commission is intended as a type of
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
collaborative of children's services and
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
the executive decero would be acceptable
 
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
in that case though the concern would be
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
the expected workload of the child
 
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
advocate in the office um the duties of
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
the executive director are not described
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
other than to say that they coordinate
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
administrative support that's um from
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
all executive branch departments um the
 
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
Department administrative support is not
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
clear in here what that looks like the
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
office already carries a pretty heavy
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
burden in terms of workload for which
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
it's under resource so it would be
 
01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
important to understand the expectations
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
of the executive director to ensure that
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
the office services are not impeded by
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
additional administrative obligations
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
for example who would be responsible to
 
01:19:13.229 --> 01:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
produce the annual report that's listed
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
on page four line three and overseeing
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
the commission Budget on page four line
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
nine um and it's not whe clear whether
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
the allocations of $150,000 would be
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
available to support these
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
administrative responsibilities for the
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.870 align:start position:0%
long thank you madam
chair

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the with respect to
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
the uh strategic plan do you think that
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
strategic plan could help in developing
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
this there'll be some recommendations
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
with which
 
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
um you know getting your your opinion
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
has to where this uh where this office
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
ought to be going after these last four
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
years sure thank you for that question
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
so the Strategic plan is designed to
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
guide the office of the child advocate
 
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
going further um we we interviewed
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
members of the oversight Commission on
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
children's services because of their
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
unique statutory relationship to the
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
office we thought it was important to
 
01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:55.719 align:start position:0%
get their input for their vision for the
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate it was
 
01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.990 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate it was
completely

01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
serendipitously that we got a lot of
 
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
feedback from the members of the
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
commission um that addressed changes
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
that needed to happen in the commission
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
itself and so we are sort of we're sort
 
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
of looking at this at how can we
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
create a collaborative or you know a
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
situation where everyone is working um
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
as best they can to to promote and
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
further children
 
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh children's experiences and outcomes
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
in the services that they receive so I
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
think at this point in the draft we've
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
only made sort of superficial
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations about the oversight
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
Commission in terms of its
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
relationship and the way that it um it
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
meets and
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
engages um we also have part of our data
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
collection was around um priority issues
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed and so looking
 
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
at those priority issues those could be
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
adopted by the over site commission I
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
think I I tread carefully here because I
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
because I don't think in the current
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
iteration of the statute and in this
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
proposed one the office of the child
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
advocate is not in a position to direct
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
the oversight commission and what they
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
need to do um and so we can only say hey
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
we found this information that you may
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
want to use to think about um and in
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
fact we did approach the um the chair to
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
say it was important at least to convene
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
a meeting because people eager to get
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
back to work um on the commission but
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
other than that it's you know it's not
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
really our place um to to address that
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
if this bill were articulated in a way
 
01:22:39.629 --> 01:22:39.639 align:start position:0%
that you ultimately there was a
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
collaborative supportive relationship
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
then I could see the the what if that
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
was a a collaborative Children's
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
Services Commission um they may look to
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
the child advocate strategic plan
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
um as something that they could further
 
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
um that would give them a really good
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
framework we're hoping that in general
 
01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
this is going to give um some direction
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
for all of us because it was such a
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
CommunityWide assessment um that isn't
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
just within the office that we're
 
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
looking at issues for kids it would be
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
for everyone so it it will certainly be
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
a useful document but we can't direct
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
the commission unless we're the
 
01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:17.990 align:start position:0%
the commission unless we're the
executive

01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
executive
 
01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
director follow up I may chair uh yeah I
 
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
I understand the directing uh but I'm
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
just thinking maybe an exit interview uh
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
is what we're looking at uh with respect
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
to youth I I I like that idea having
 
01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.910 align:start position:0%
to youth I I I like that idea having
Youth

01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
Youth
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
represented um would you have that under
 
01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.870 align:start position:0%
represented um would you have that under
the

01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
may have a PP a member a youth member I
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
I was just looking where you would think
 
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
the youth would fit into your
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation of representation yeah
 
01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:11.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question they are
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
they are in the Bill they are listed
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
under the public and I I would recommend
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
keeping them there they are members of
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
the public you could think of them as
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
consumers of um of children's services
 
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
um and so I do think that they fit well
 
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:27.639 align:start position:0%
and and if the focus is in all state
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
services on consumer satisfaction um
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
then that's that's a good sort of place
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
and um and representation of the um of
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
the of their of their
 
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
perspective okay great thank you are
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
there any further
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%

02:26:48.750 --> 02:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
Balden represent hillsb District 12
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for um hearing this bill today
 
02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'll keep it really brief um currently
 
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
the standard New Hampshire parenting
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
plan requires both unmarried parents to
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
give their consent before a child can
 
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
receive non-emergency Health Care um
 
02:27:08.030 --> 02:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Care such as talk therapy
 
02:27:10.830 --> 02:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
falls under that umbrella um the New
 
02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Suicide Prevention Council
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
recently published its 2020 Suicide
 
02:27:16.990 --> 02:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
Prevention plan which includes a go to
 
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
increase access to treatment for mental
 
02:27:21.269 --> 02:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
illness I believe this legislation is in
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
alignment with that
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
goal um when two parents are married one
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
is obviously permitted to enroll their
 
02:27:29.070 --> 02:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
child in mental health care without the
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
consent of the other parent um so I
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't see why unmarried parents should
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
be limited in a way that married parents
 
02:27:39.790 --> 02:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
are not um children don't always have
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
solid and open relationships with their
 
02:27:44.670 --> 02:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
parents I think any parent here has
 
02:27:48.429 --> 02:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
certainly experienced that um and this
 
02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be aggravated by divorce uh
 
02:27:55.269 --> 02:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
most definitely if a child in a divorced
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
or unmarried parent situation is willing
 
02:27:58.990 --> 02:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
to go to one parent with their mental
 
02:28:00.670 --> 02:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
health issues and their concerns but not
 
02:28:03.389 --> 02:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
to another parent um it can be difficult
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
to get total buyin without having to
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
cause additional stress to the child and
 
02:28:11.269 --> 02:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
furthermore in situations of possible
 
02:28:13.630 --> 02:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
child abuse by one parent it's important
 
02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
for the child to be able to access
 
02:28:17.349 --> 02:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
mental health support without having to
 
02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
obtain the consent of the possible
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
abuser um this bill I don't intend for
 
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
it to give cart blanch to either parent
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
just to allow treatment to begin um
 
02:28:28.830 --> 02:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
instead of preventing access to
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
treatment entirely allow the child to
 
02:28:32.429 --> 02:28:32.439 align:start position:0%
enter mental health treatment as soon as
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
possible and then leave it to the adults
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
to settle the issue in court if there is
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
substantial disagreement um so basically
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
just open the door let's get started um
 
02:28:43.950 --> 02:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
most of the mental health care available
 
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is uh uh legitimate and
 
02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
reasonably provided there aren't a lot
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
of situations where it's possible for
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
someone to take their child to a mental
 
02:28:56.910 --> 02:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
health provider who's going to be
 
02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
harming the child um so to be able to
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
move forward and get mental health
 
02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
treatment started and then to leave it
 
02:29:07.150 --> 02:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
to the adults to figure out the details
 
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
or debate it later in the court system I
 
02:29:10.269 --> 02:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
think is ideal it's in the best interest
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
of the child to be able to proceed with
 
02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
that kind of treatment um instead of
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
having to delay the onset of treatment
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
until the until after the adults have
 
02:29:20.590 --> 02:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
settled their
 
02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
differences and that's all I have thank
 
02:29:25.349 --> 02:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:29:27.870 --> 02:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
yella thank you and uh thank you for
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
taking the question um it seems like
 
02:29:33.550 --> 02:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
your bill is trying to address that they
 
02:29:37.309 --> 02:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
both have to have Buy in from for um
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
before the services are provided um what
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
if if instead of both of them have to
 
02:29:48.070 --> 02:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
have Buy in what if they just have to
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
the one parent has to just notify the
 
02:29:51.550 --> 02:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
other person like if they're on their
 
02:29:53.389 --> 02:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
way to the thing on the way to the
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
service and they just say hey I'm on my
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
way um I'm doing it kind of a thing they
 
02:30:00.670 --> 02:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to have Buy in but the other
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
person would know before the treatment
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
actually starts so that you know let's
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
say it was um harmful or they had a
 
02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
disagreement then they would be able to
 
02:30:15.950 --> 02:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
express that and um take appropriate a
 
02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
action maybe even with the authorities
 
02:30:20.910 --> 02:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
if necessary um what would you what
 
02:30:22.990 --> 02:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
would you say to that thanks for the
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
question um as far as involving the
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
authorities um I think it depends on the
 
02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
situation and whether or not it's
 
02:30:31.349 --> 02:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate to bring police around a
 
02:30:34.630 --> 02:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
child who's maybe you know the range of
 
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
situations in which it you realize as a
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
parent that Mental Health Care is needed
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're wide ranging and you may or may
 
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
not need the involvement of uh law
 
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement but you may still still
 
02:30:49.150 --> 02:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
desperately need mental health care
 
02:30:50.269 --> 02:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
especially because it's the sort of
 
02:30:52.590 --> 02:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
issue that can compound pretty quickly
 
02:30:56.070 --> 02:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
into an emergency situation um depending
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
on what's going on with the child the
 
02:30:59.269 --> 02:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know obviously we're talking about a
 
02:31:01.469 --> 02:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
huge topic of just mental health in
 
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
general um super vague there um the bill
 
02:31:08.429 --> 02:31:08.439 align:start position:0%
uh requires that the parent who
 
02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
consented a loone to the mental health
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
care notify the other parent within 30
 
02:31:14.429 --> 02:31:14.439 align:start position:0%
days of the onset of treatment and I
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
think that that's reasonable and needs
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
to be reasonable um I don't think that
 
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable to expect someone to be
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
making a phone call when they're in the
 
02:31:24.670 --> 02:31:24.680 align:start position:0%
middle of a crisis potentially um and I
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
think that 30 days is just uh on par for
 
02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
normal uh like New Hampshire uh statute
 
02:31:33.550 --> 02:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
I think that's probably the most that we
 
02:31:35.269 --> 02:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
can expect from someone is that they
 
02:31:36.790 --> 02:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity for things to calm
 
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
down and to be able to communicate
 
02:31:40.269 --> 02:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
through an attorney or directly to the
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
other person um and then everyone can
 
02:31:46.990 --> 02:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
see how the treatment's proceeding maybe
 
02:31:50.590 --> 02:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
before taking it to court so my concern
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
would be um what what
 
02:31:57.309 --> 02:31:57.319 align:start position:0%
if the parent that is is seeking the
 
02:31:59.630 --> 02:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment for the child is
 
02:32:02.030 --> 02:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
not the parent that's going to be paying
 
02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
for this and they in Turn end up getting
 
02:32:08.190 --> 02:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
a bill before that 30 days and haven't
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
been notified I could see that causing
 
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
quite an adversarial
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
situation and probably what's I'm
 
02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
guessing could probably already be
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
adversarial you know we don't want to we
 
02:32:23.550 --> 02:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to put
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
more fighting in there you
 
02:32:31.309 --> 02:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
know I I agree that um we don't want to
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
be setting people up who are already in
 
02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
Conflict to have more conflict um but if
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
they're already in Conflict to the
 
02:32:39.309 --> 02:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
extent that one person is willing to
 
02:32:42.349 --> 02:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
interfere and potentially um prevent the
 
02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
child from accessing mental health care
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to go back to
 
02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
focusing on the benefits for the child
 
02:32:50.230 --> 02:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
and if there's some kind of you know a
 
02:32:52.349 --> 02:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
few hundred dollars here and there sort
 
02:32:53.950 --> 02:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
of even upwards of a thousand dollar
 
02:32:55.710 --> 02:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
bill that needs to be managed after the
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
fact that's I think that's the idea is
 
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
that we allow the child to get health
 
02:33:02.670 --> 02:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
care in a way that I I feel like the
 
02:33:05.389 --> 02:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
complexity of mental healthare is that
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
um an emergency situation is when
 
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
something has gone untreated for a very
 
02:33:12.710 --> 02:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
very long time and it seems unnecessary
 
02:33:14.389 --> 02:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
to let things go for that long if
 
02:33:15.790 --> 02:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
there's a disagreement between parents
 
02:33:17.630 --> 02:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
that may just simply be Financial or
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
maybe ideological or something like that
 
02:33:21.550 --> 02:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
right what I but what I'm what I'm
 
02:33:26.269 --> 02:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
saying is is that um if if that is how
 
02:33:28.429 --> 02:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
the parent finds out that their child
 
02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
has gotten help right it's it's not
 
02:33:34.269 --> 02:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily the money it's the fact that
 
02:33:37.269 --> 02:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
the other parent has not notified them
 
02:33:39.389 --> 02:33:39.399 align:start position:0%
until 30 days later and they're finding
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
out that their child's in
 
02:33:43.950 --> 02:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
crisis through a bill in the mail if you
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to make it shorter I mean I don't
 
02:33:47.950 --> 02:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
think that a phone call is like in the
 
02:33:51.349 --> 02:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
middle of the ordeal day after because
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
or like seven days or something you know
 
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
I just don't want to see them getting a
 
02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
bill and saying oh so my child's in
 
02:34:00.269 --> 02:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
crisis wait what the billing can take a
 
02:34:03.070 --> 02:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
long time anyway I mean you know how it
 
02:34:05.469 --> 02:34:05.479 align:start position:0%
is dealing with medical bills oh yeah um
 
02:34:07.070 --> 02:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
that you think something else is all set
 
02:34:08.190 --> 02:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
and the insurance paid for it and then
 
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
two months later they you know the
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
hospital mails you something and you're
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
like what what do they need $20 for um
 
02:34:17.830 --> 02:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
and uh I think think that the instances
 
02:34:22.870 --> 02:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
in which someone um has the entirety of
 
02:34:25.389 --> 02:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
the financial obligation for medical
 
02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
expenses and only shares half of the
 
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
decision- making um responsibility are
 
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
probably rare and I would think that the
 
02:34:34.990 --> 02:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
court would be encouraging people to
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
share in the expenses whenever possible
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
if they're sharing in the decision-
 
02:34:41.550 --> 02:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
making okay um but I'd be willing to
 
02:34:44.349 --> 02:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
shorten the length of time um but I
 
02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
don't see a benefit to denying the child
 
02:34:49.630 --> 02:34:49.640 align:start position:0%
mental health care because parents can't
 
02:34:51.790 --> 02:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
get along right and I'm not saying to
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
deny them I'm more concerned about the
 
02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
time frame and a parent being notified
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
of a mental health crisis via a medical
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
bill yeah and that's what I mean is that
 
02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
I think it currently there are children
 
02:35:03.309 --> 02:35:03.319 align:start position:0%
being denied mental health care because
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
parents can't get along the court system
 
02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
is very backed up and enabling one
 
02:35:09.630 --> 02:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
parent to just go ahead and healthare um
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
I think would help countless
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
children especially children that are in
 
02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
a divorce situation
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
representative yella yes thank you and
 
02:35:25.150 --> 02:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that um there
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
is even even when um there is sha shared
 
02:35:38.190 --> 02:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
payment responsibilities for the medical
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
services that the actual responsibility
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
from the um provider is
 
02:35:49.030 --> 02:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
only to a single parent and then the
 
02:35:51.550 --> 02:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
other parent has to request the funds
 
02:35:55.630 --> 02:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
from the from the other parent and so um
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
when you say that there is the
 
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
possibility that you know they they just
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
have to go and request it if the person
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
isn't notified ahead of time that could
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
also encourage them to not pay their
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
half and then would be essentially
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
another opportunity child be able to
 
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
access mental health care than it is
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we prevent people who are probably
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
already very Petty and engaged in
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
extensive um litigation to just add one
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
more filing to the
 
02:36:29.309 --> 02:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
docket like I think that those are
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
extraneous situations and I think that
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
we need to think about the
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
kids okay are there any further
 
02:36:39.269 --> 02:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
questions right seeing down thank you
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
very much thank you should I turn this
 
02:36:42.670 --> 02:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
off or leave it on uh turn it off and

I'd like to point out another one
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
serious Hole uh it's been my personal

was even going to see a psychiatrist or
 
02:37:41.790 --> 02:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
this is 11 years old a few hours later I

uh you know I had no I had no idea what
 
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
she was on I know and then go look up
 
02:37:53.230 --> 02:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
what it was
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
and lot of these psych drugs have have
 
02:37:58.590 --> 02:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
Suicidal Thoughts as as one of the side
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
side effects and for one parent to have
 
02:38:04.030 --> 02:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
no idea that this is going on is uh you
 
02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
know it's a travesty of Justice really
 
02:38:09.269 --> 02:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
um you know I uh you know the the the
 
02:38:12.830 --> 02:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
courts uh sometimes sometimes they they
 
02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
they go sideways you know uh of
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative rice and I have talked
 
02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
about uh you know uh that uh Family
 
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
Court judges are human beings and when
 
02:38:24.429 --> 02:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
they get they get overloaded and they
 
02:38:27.070 --> 02:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
get some real tough cases uh one or the
 
02:38:29.550 --> 02:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
other you know in the next five cases
 
02:38:32.030 --> 02:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
gets discriminated against really uh you
 
02:38:33.230 --> 02:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
know some of the some of these tough
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
cases are are horrendous but we don't uh
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion is is
 
02:38:42.030 --> 02:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
a as an out for them I I think that
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be reeled in you know and we
 
02:38:45.389 --> 02:38:45.399 align:start position:0%
can we have a chance to do that with
 
02:38:48.349 --> 02:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
this bill for for sure um you know uh
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
medical decisions unless it's an
 
02:38:52.830 --> 02:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
emergency situation should be shared by
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
both parents you know and uh you know un
 
02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
unless one's a you know a bad alcoholic
 
02:39:00.349 --> 02:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
or you know out of their mind whatever
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know um you know unless unless is a
 
02:39:06.070 --> 02:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
good reason not to um you know and uh
 
02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
the judges have to have to step up and
 
02:39:11.349 --> 02:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
and put this in writing and you know I
 
02:39:12.510 --> 02:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to see anybody else go
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
through what I went through you know it
 
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
was you know a good 10 hours was a hell
 
02:39:18.190 --> 02:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
you know before they they got her
 
02:39:23.269 --> 02:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
stabilized and U you know to have have
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
have to sit there and and have you know
 
02:39:28.349 --> 02:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
10 minutes uh before my ex-wife leaves
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%

notification that she's on this medicine
 
02:39:35.469 --> 02:39:35.479 align:start position:0%
um wasn't right and uh you know it
 
02:39:36.990 --> 02:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like this this well-meaning bill
 
02:39:40.469 --> 02:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
needs a few amendments or or you know
 
02:39:41.870 --> 02:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
needs to go to a study committee or
 
02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
whatever for me uh to you know to fix it
 
02:39:47.469 --> 02:39:47.479 align:start position:0%

and we are back so I'm going to open the
 
02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 139
 
02:51:20.309 --> 02:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
six and um representative Amanda Balden
 
02:51:30.269 --> 02:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:32.269 --> 02:51:32.279 align:start position:0%
bill hello
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
again um I recognize that I have three
 
02:51:35.870 --> 02:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
bills in your committee back toback so
 
02:51:37.870 --> 02:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
I've made an I did that on
 
02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
purpose uh thank you that saves my time
 
02:51:42.269 --> 02:51:42.279 align:start position:0%
and I want to save your time by making
 
02:51:45.070 --> 02:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
all of my testimony as short as possible
 
02:51:47.070 --> 02:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
um so again I'm Amanda Balden represent
 
02:51:48.269 --> 02:51:48.279 align:start position:0%
hillsbor District
 
02:51:51.309 --> 02:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
12 um on 1396 I just think that a
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
uniform support order should have a due
 
02:51:54.790 --> 02:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
date without a due date the meaning of
 
02:51:57.830 --> 02:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
Rees is unclear to all parties involved
 
02:51:59.990 --> 02:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
um there's no space on the current
 
02:52:02.550 --> 02:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
uniform support order um for the judge
 
02:52:06.590 --> 02:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
to specify due date in standing order 5A
 
02:52:08.670 --> 02:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
on page six which I provided to you all
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure you million times that was
 
02:52:13.550 --> 02:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
great um it attempts to speak to due
 
02:52:14.990 --> 02:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
dates but it's really vague
 
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
so um let's see if I can find it really
 
02:52:20.830 --> 02:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
quickly it says if no date appears in
 
02:52:22.389 --> 02:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph five of the uniform support
 
02:52:24.229 --> 02:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
order the first support payment shall be
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
due on the date this order is signed by
 
02:52:28.190 --> 02:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
the judge so in a way it kind of and I
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
think that this leaves a lot open to
 
02:52:32.030 --> 02:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
litigation because there's some words
 
02:52:36.389 --> 02:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
um and obviously like the the the
 
02:52:44.670 --> 02:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
standing order 5A in combination with um
 
02:52:48.269 --> 02:52:48.279 align:start position:0%
what is it paragraph five um are being
 
02:52:51.469 --> 02:52:51.479 align:start position:0%
used to establish a due date but I think
 
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
that it's um insufficiently clear and uh
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
I also provided you with RSA 461a colon
 
02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
14 part uh what is that eight 18 um
 
02:53:06.190 --> 02:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
which might be like the last page that I
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
gave you uh it talks about when a reage
 
02:53:11.229 --> 02:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
equals or exceeds the equivalent of
 
02:53:13.269 --> 02:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
eight weeks of Child Support under the
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
existing order how do you
 
02:53:17.910 --> 02:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
determine when something's late if the
 
02:53:20.030 --> 02:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
due date is so unclear is it due within
 
02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
the month is it due by the date that is
 
02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
not named as a due date um I think those
 
02:53:29.429 --> 02:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
are some pretty
 
02:53:32.750 --> 02:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
big questions and additionally if
 
02:53:36.830 --> 02:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
someone's on a private um child support
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
payment setup and they're um the other
 
02:53:44.710 --> 02:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
parents been reliably paying and then
 
02:53:46.190 --> 02:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
something happens and they want to
 
02:53:50.150 --> 02:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
pursue they have a right to pursue
 
02:53:52.630 --> 02:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
um what do you call it uh the Bureau of
 
02:53:55.950 --> 02:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services can um attach the
 
02:53:59.229 --> 02:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
wages thank you yeah um I included the
 
02:54:02.229 --> 02:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
forms um because again it's really
 
02:54:04.269 --> 02:54:04.279 align:start position:0%
unclear at what point someone would
 
02:54:06.790 --> 02:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
sufficiently be late in order to qualify
 
02:54:09.910 --> 02:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
in order for the obl obligate to qualify
 
02:54:11.469 --> 02:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
for garnishment through the Bureau of
 
02:54:13.550 --> 02:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
char a due date would clarify things
 
02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:16.429 align:start position:0%
char a due date would clarify things
make

02:54:16.429 --> 02:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:19.269 --> 02:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
all this straightforward and simple in a
 
02:54:21.710 --> 02:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
lot of ways and make the conversation of
 
02:54:24.510 --> 02:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
like they're late they're not late more
 
02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
straightforward and a lot shorter and
 
02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully reduce litigation so that's
 
02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
all thanks okay are there any questions
 
02:54:37.630 --> 02:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:40.229 --> 02:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
Balden representative
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
yella thank you and thank you for uh
 
02:54:46.269 --> 02:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
02:54:49.269 --> 02:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
um would it surprise you that the that
 
02:54:54.510 --> 02:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
the court would not garnish wages or um
 
02:54:57.550 --> 02:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
really seek much enforcement
 
02:55:00.349 --> 02:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh for non-payment until there was a
 
02:55:03.110 --> 02:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
substantial amount let's say
 
02:55:08.070 --> 02:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
$10,000 um in back child support or or
 
02:55:12.790 --> 02:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
payment and um so if there was something
 
02:55:14.670 --> 02:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
that was like $500 that it's going to be
 
02:55:17.150 --> 02:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
late that that the court
 
02:55:20.670 --> 02:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
might not actually enforce that due date
 
02:55:20.680 --> 02:55:21.389 align:start position:0%
might not actually enforce that due date
and

02:55:21.389 --> 02:55:21.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:21.399 --> 02:55:23.190 align:start position:0%
and
so

02:55:23.190 --> 02:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:25.429 --> 02:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
I'm would you believe that to be correct
 
02:55:28.429 --> 02:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
and would you expect that that maybe we
 
02:55:31.309 --> 02:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
should change also the enforcement of
 
02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
that to be a lower amount um so that
 
02:55:36.590 --> 02:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
these due dates are actually like
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
meaningful in some way thank you thanks
 
02:55:40.990 --> 02:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
for the question I mean I think that
 
02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
that is the problem is that the way that
 
02:55:43.790 --> 02:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
due dates are sort of worded and
 
02:55:45.309 --> 02:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
referred to too currently or too vague
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
to be enforced um but also specifically
 
02:55:53.429 --> 02:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
I was trying to refer to when someone um
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
is the oblige and the obligor um fails
 
02:56:01.950 --> 02:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
to pay on time um I couldn't find um
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
where I had read in the past that uh I
 
02:56:06.550 --> 02:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't find the the actual wording but
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that so I didn't
 
02:56:09.269 --> 02:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
print it for you but my understanding
 
02:56:12.110 --> 02:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
that once someone is 30 days behind um
 
02:56:14.870 --> 02:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
the oblige has the right to request that
 
02:56:17.469 --> 02:56:17.479 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Support Services um
 
02:56:20.070 --> 02:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
begin managing the processing of the
 
02:56:22.750 --> 02:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
payments instead of payment and that's
 
02:56:25.389 --> 02:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
really what I'm referring to when I say
 
02:56:29.190 --> 02:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
that that uh it's difficult for someone
 
02:56:30.590 --> 02:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
to determine when they should be
 
02:56:31.870 --> 02:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
contacting the Bureau of Child Support
 
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
Services if the due date is not even
 
02:56:36.790 --> 02:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
clear to the oblige um how do you know
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
when that 30 days is passed and you have
 
02:56:40.030 --> 02:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
a right to fill out the form you have a
 
02:56:43.630 --> 02:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
right to start that conversation um and
 
02:56:46.030 --> 02:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
then with this I think in both cases
 
02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
with the 8 weeks and the 30
 
02:56:51.070 --> 02:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
days it seems like all that anyone's
 
02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
left to do in any of those situations
 
02:56:55.030 --> 02:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
just wait an extraordinarily long time
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
um until they can be absolutely
 
02:56:58.190 --> 02:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
confident and that doesn't seem to be in
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
the best interest of
 
02:57:02.670 --> 02:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
anyone participating I don't think that
 
02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
that was the intent in having
 
02:57:05.630 --> 02:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
institutions like the Bureau of Child
 
02:57:07.710 --> 02:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
Support Services and having these these
 
02:57:09.030 --> 02:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
statutes I don't think that the the
 
02:57:11.070 --> 02:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
intent was for someone to have to wait
 
02:57:12.790 --> 02:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
an extraordinarily long time beyond what
 
02:57:14.710 --> 02:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
was specified in law so that they can be
 
02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
sure that they're satisfying the law and
 
02:57:18.190 --> 02:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
so I think that just a simple due date
 
02:57:20.030 --> 02:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
on the uniform support order would
 
02:57:24.830 --> 02:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:27.389 --> 02:57:27.399 align:start position:0%
represent and would
 
02:57:27.399 --> 02:57:29.710 align:start position:0%
represent and would
you

02:57:29.710 --> 02:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
um agree that with the amount of cases
 
02:57:35.349 --> 02:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
that are handled prosay that reading
 
02:57:38.110 --> 02:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
this paperwork it would really make it
 
02:57:41.309 --> 02:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
more clear for people to have a better
 
02:57:43.229 --> 02:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
understanding of what exactly is
 
02:57:45.229 --> 02:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
expected of them and
 
02:57:49.830 --> 02:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
when you get me yeah that's 100% it it
 
02:57:51.389 --> 02:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
someone shouldn't have to turn to the
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
seventh page of the legal ease and fine
 
02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
print literally smaller print in the
 
02:57:57.469 --> 02:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
back of the uniform support order to
 
02:58:00.870 --> 02:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
figure out whether or not um they should
 
02:58:05.910 --> 02:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
be pursuing the obl obligor um or not
 
02:58:07.389 --> 02:58:07.399 align:start position:0%
you know and whether they they have to
 
02:58:10.750 --> 02:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
wait and you know it's certainly
 
02:58:12.389 --> 02:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
complicated and if you're going to be
 
02:58:15.229 --> 02:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
concerned about um receiving child
 
02:58:17.309 --> 02:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
support payments just 30 days out from
 
02:58:19.229 --> 02:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
when they were due then I imagine that
 
02:58:20.510 --> 02:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have the financial means to
 
02:58:22.349 --> 02:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
hire an attorney at that point and it
 
02:58:25.550 --> 02:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
being um plain English is important so
 
02:58:27.950 --> 02:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for understanding I'm glad it
 
02:58:29.550 --> 02:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
feel understood you know that was the
 
02:58:31.269 --> 02:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
intent with the bill so let's make it
 
02:58:35.429 --> 02:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
simple okay are there any further
 
02:58:37.710 --> 02:58:37.720 align:start position:0%

Vivian Gerard and I actually own a small
 
03:00:14.110 --> 03:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
business Timber post bed and breakfast
 
03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
and I've been deeply affected by uh the
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
child support bill um in many ways and
 
03:00:22.150 --> 03:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
actually I am also speaking a week from
 
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
today on several other bills but I have
 
03:00:27.190 --> 03:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
met all the New Hampshire guidelines for
 
03:00:30.750 --> 03:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
child support for the last seven years
 
03:00:33.269 --> 03:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
the payments uh that have that I have
 
03:00:34.830 --> 03:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
received have been very
 
03:00:37.830 --> 03:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
sporadic and and in nature due to the
 
03:00:40.190 --> 03:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
multiple appeals of the child support
 
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau um I have not received child
 
03:00:46.750 --> 03:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
support really in seven years uh when
 
03:00:50.710 --> 03:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with the uh BCC bcss excuse me I
 
03:00:53.349 --> 03:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
I just I want you you need to focus on
 
03:00:55.710 --> 03:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
the bill at hand and the subject matter
 
03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
of that bill so regarding how um
 
03:01:03.630 --> 03:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
1396 right
 
03:01:08.110 --> 03:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
explicit date on it would have you know
 
03:01:10.190 --> 03:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
how that would affect your case well I
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
was trying to give you the background so
 
03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
I can kind of tie that together okay if
 
03:01:18.150 --> 03:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
if that's okay sure okay um when dealing
 
03:01:21.150 --> 03:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
with the bcss the support payments that
 
03:01:22.990 --> 03:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
I should have had should have been
 
03:01:26.670 --> 03:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
immediate um as I say iMed immediate I
 
03:01:28.110 --> 03:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
mean I've been going on for seven years
 
03:01:30.630 --> 03:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
and I still have not seen a full child
 
03:01:33.110 --> 03:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
support payment from my ex uh the speed
 
03:01:36.510 --> 03:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
of the the bureau the bureau bureaucracy
 
03:01:38.910 --> 03:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
should not dictate provided basic for
 
03:01:41.750 --> 03:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
one CH one's children I have been forced
 
03:01:43.790 --> 03:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
on several occasions to depend on the TA
 
03:01:45.750 --> 03:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the State of New Hampshire
 
03:01:48.349 --> 03:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
to cover for the unnecessary shortfalls
 
03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
because of the delay in the child
 
03:01:52.590 --> 03:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
support I have not received any support
 
03:01:56.710 --> 03:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
payments for December 2021 at all as
 
03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
well as January
 
03:02:00.870 --> 03:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
2022 when we got the order it was
 
03:02:03.830 --> 03:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
actually October 25th and as of today I
 
03:02:05.670 --> 03:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
still have not received any child
 
03:02:11.389 --> 03:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
support at all uh the payer stops paying
 
03:02:14.429 --> 03:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
for for he does he he he stops paying
 
03:02:17.429 --> 03:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
for any inconceivable reasons um
 
03:02:19.590 --> 03:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
enforcing the child support for
 
03:02:22.349 --> 03:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
non-payment and following up on the arar
 
03:02:24.910 --> 03:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
I miss three payments the court
 
03:02:27.790 --> 03:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
shall it should be after three payments
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
the court shall garnish their wages
 
03:02:33.309 --> 03:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
discretion will no longer be appropriate
 
03:02:36.469 --> 03:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
after three times before Dela um
 
03:02:39.150 --> 03:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
effectively affirmed into C's decision
 
03:02:41.190 --> 03:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
then Dela undercut the child support
 
03:02:43.309 --> 03:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines eliminated and dismissing
 
03:02:46.510 --> 03:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
about $75,000 in AAR in my
 
03:02:49.870 --> 03:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
case uh the judge have IND Discretions
 
03:02:51.750 --> 03:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
on the child's report caused the past
 
03:02:55.349 --> 03:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
seven years of arrar in my case to be
 
03:02:57.710 --> 03:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
eliminated it simply seems that the
 
03:03:00.349 --> 03:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
judge just didn't want to do the math
 
03:03:03.150 --> 03:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
and simply simply focus on the New Order
 
03:03:06.830 --> 03:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
moving forward causing to me to lose 75%
 
03:03:11.030 --> 03:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the child support arear in August
 
03:03:15.790 --> 03:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
2021 Mr Silva at the time my ex um asked
 
03:03:17.710 --> 03:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
the court to actually
 
03:03:20.269 --> 03:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
reduce his support down to
 
03:03:23.790 --> 03:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
$192 a month for two children with no
 
03:03:26.510 --> 03:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
AAR while earning
 
03:03:29.070 --> 03:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
$150,000 and again I I understand that
 
03:03:30.910 --> 03:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
and please pardon my Interruption but
 
03:03:33.550 --> 03:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what this has to do with
 
03:03:35.670 --> 03:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
this bill okay do you know what I'm
 
03:03:38.750 --> 03:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
saying I do like this bill simply wants
 
03:03:42.229 --> 03:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
to change to make it so that an actual
 
03:03:47.830 --> 03:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
due date is on the order and that's so
 
03:03:50.710 --> 03:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
just to show you this binder here okay
 
03:03:53.309 --> 03:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
came from my court date on August
 
03:03:57.510 --> 03:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
9th my attorney my uh judge at the time
 
03:04:01.070 --> 03:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
was Dela Dela gave my ex a date to start
 
03:04:04.269 --> 03:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
paying child support on which was the
 
03:04:08.349 --> 03:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
1 of November so we had a date he had a
 
03:04:12.110 --> 03:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
date but nobody is holding him
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
accountable on that date and even by
 
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
going to the child's support Bureau that
 
03:04:23.229 --> 03:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
date does not exist because he pays when
 
03:04:25.990 --> 03:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
he wants when he wants and as much as he
 
03:04:29.469 --> 03:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
feels like and I and I trust me okay I
 
03:04:31.750 --> 03:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
totally understand that okay I have two
 
03:04:33.389 --> 03:04:33.399 align:start position:0%
adult children I'm still old over
 
03:04:36.309 --> 03:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
$770,000 wor of child support but what
 
03:04:38.349 --> 03:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
I'm saying they don't have a date on it
 
03:04:40.590 --> 03:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
then how do they pay if there is no
 
03:04:45.830 --> 03:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:48.990 --> 03:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
do you yeah I just I just want to make
 
03:04:52.469 --> 03:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
sure I'm understanding this yeah thank
 
03:04:55.910 --> 03:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you for taking the question
 
03:04:58.830 --> 03:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that your testimony
 
03:05:02.910 --> 03:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
set is that you had a date
 
03:05:07.150 --> 03:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
um but the enforcement of the DAT or the
 
03:05:10.269 --> 03:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
lack of enforcement of the date
 
03:05:13.950 --> 03:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
is why you believe that it's not that
 
03:05:16.590 --> 03:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
this bill maybe isn't going to fix the
 
03:05:19.750 --> 03:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
problem because you're is that is that
 
03:05:21.670 --> 03:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
the because there's no enforcement of
 
03:05:24.030 --> 03:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
that I believe that yes I believe that
 
03:05:25.830 --> 03:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is correct that even though you say
 
03:05:28.429 --> 03:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
that there's a date on there that date
 
03:05:31.429 --> 03:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
because nobody's holding the holding the
 
03:05:34.990 --> 03:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
the pay accountable that date really
 
03:05:39.309 --> 03:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
does not exist and this is only a third
 
03:05:42.070 --> 03:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
of the of the paperwork to show that the
 
03:05:44.190 --> 03:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
judges all along the my case for the
 
03:05:46.750 --> 03:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
last seven years has not been held
 
03:05:49.190 --> 03:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
accountable for dates they would just
 
03:05:51.469 --> 03:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
write orders with
 
03:05:54.590 --> 03:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
no W with no accountability on the other
 
03:05:57.710 --> 03:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
side so here I am seven years
 
03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
later depending on what judge you went
 
03:06:02.229 --> 03:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
to you might get a date you might not
 
03:06:03.510 --> 03:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
get a date if you go to the child
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
support Bureau then you may have a date
 
03:06:08.830 --> 03:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
but nobody's holding them accountable
 
03:06:11.550 --> 03:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
for those dates so even if you say put a
 
03:06:12.910 --> 03:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
date on the paper that doesn't mean
 
03:06:12.920 --> 03:06:14.229 align:start position:0%
date on the paper that doesn't mean
anything

03:06:14.229 --> 03:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:06:17.070 --> 03:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
okay so here I am you know seven years
 
03:06:20.229 --> 03:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
later and not getting any child support
 
03:06:24.750 --> 03:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:28.309 --> 03:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
documentation okay I get it now I was
 
03:06:30.429 --> 03:06:30.439 align:start position:0%
confused okay I wasn't sure where this
 
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
was going yeah it's very confusing
 
03:06:35.349 --> 03:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
because it has been seven years in the
 
03:06:38.150 --> 03:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
Mak many of the laws that are coming out
 
03:06:40.349 --> 03:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
next week actually apply because of my
 
03:06:44.309 --> 03:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
case and because the the judge um was
 
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
not following the laww at the very
 
03:06:48.229 --> 03:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
beginning which also complicated my
 
03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
whole case so are you
 
03:06:53.469 --> 03:06:53.479 align:start position:0%
testifying in support or in opposition
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill um I am actually in support of
 
03:07:08.469 --> 03:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:10.670 --> 03:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
accountable it's no good if they're not
 
03:07:14.630 --> 03:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
accountable okay representative
 
03:07:16.830 --> 03:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
ler thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
for being here and I appreciate your
 
03:07:22.190 --> 03:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:24.630 --> 03:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
so basically what you're saying is you
 
03:07:27.630 --> 03:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
want us to put in a due date with the
 
03:07:28.990 --> 03:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
ability to hold somebody accountable
 
03:07:31.110 --> 03:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
correct correct because this just says a
 
03:07:34.030 --> 03:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
due date correct okay so what I would
 
03:07:36.349 --> 03:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
like to see is if as you go through
 
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
court and you actually have an order
 
03:07:40.590 --> 03:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
that there's some time frame after that
 
03:07:43.269 --> 03:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
they they're expected to pay not three
 
03:07:43.279 --> 03:07:45.269 align:start position:0%
they they're expected to pay not three
months

03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:07:47.229 --> 03:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
later thank you for your clarification
 
03:07:48.190 --> 03:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for letting me
 
03:07:50.990 --> 03:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
answer the question okay thank you thank
 
03:07:54.469 --> 03:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:57.510 --> 03:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
much okay so I have no other paint
 
03:08:05.070 --> 03:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
cards does anybody have a paint card no

1286 and um
 
03:08:16.469 --> 03:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
I mean 1396 I

03:08:42.000 --> 03:16:11.309 align:start position:0%
 
1286

03:16:11.309 --> 03:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:11.319 --> 03:21:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:21:29.630 --> 03:21:29.640 align:start position:0%

1286 and um I'm recognizing ing
 
03:21:44.910 --> 03:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
representative Amanda Balden to speak to
 
03:21:44.920 --> 03:21:49.309 align:start position:0%
representative Amanda Balden to speak to
her

03:21:49.309 --> 03:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:53.189 --> 03:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
bill hello again
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
hi um I'm man balen representing
 
03:21:58.110 --> 03:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 12 um to me this is
 
03:22:00.670 --> 03:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill the legislature wrote
 
03:22:02.750 --> 03:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
this list with the intent of confining
 
03:22:04.469 --> 03:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
the changes any changes to the parenting
 
03:22:07.870 --> 03:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
plan to the issues on this list um which
 
03:22:12.070 --> 03:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
is uh I gave my copy away but uh one
 
03:22:13.030 --> 03:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
what is
 
03:22:16.389 --> 03:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
it 461
 
03:22:19.269 --> 03:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
A1 you got it 461
 
03:22:22.590 --> 03:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
A1 so that's the list that I'm referring
 
03:22:26.389 --> 03:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
to um there's been the the much more
 
03:22:30.990 --> 03:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
decision and more recently the H what
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:38.910 --> 03:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
name I forgot the other name oh Kelly um
 
03:22:40.630 --> 03:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
and in both situations it seems like the
 
03:22:42.269 --> 03:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
trial court
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
um modified the parenting plan outside
 
03:22:48.750 --> 03:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
of the reasons listed in 461 a11 and um
 
03:22:50.030 --> 03:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
then when they went to the Supreme Court
 
03:22:51.469 --> 03:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court said the legislature
 
03:22:53.790 --> 03:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
intended for the changes to be confined
 
03:22:57.309 --> 03:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
to the reasons listed here and
 
03:22:59.590 --> 03:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
um and so the uh changes to the
 
03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
parenting plan were undone by the
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and so it's pretty clear
 
03:23:05.790 --> 03:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
that between 2009 and 2017 which were
 
03:23:06.990 --> 03:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
the two cases that I mentioned that went
 
03:23:09.229 --> 03:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court there's been this
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
long-standing issue of trial courts not
 
03:23:12.710 --> 03:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily understanding that they have
 
03:23:14.670 --> 03:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
to make changes that are confined to the
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
list um and that they can't really go
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
outside of that and I think that a small
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
change in wording could clarify that
 
03:23:25.110 --> 03:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
issue um for the courts and for people
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
that you know for attorneys for people
 
03:23:28.630 --> 03:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
that are filing
 
03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
a and she just nods at you she's like
 
03:23:36.790 --> 03:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah um and then I think that
 
03:23:38.750 --> 03:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
Additionally you know relying on case
 
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
law is bad governance um it needs to be
 
03:23:43.349 --> 03:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
entered into the statute it needs to be
 
03:23:45.070 --> 03:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
clarified in statute we have case law
 
03:23:47.990 --> 03:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
because legislatures are are unclear um
 
03:23:50.510 --> 03:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
so this is our opportunity to clear this
 
03:23:54.349 --> 03:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
issue up and um additionally seeing as
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
this issue keeps coming up over and over
 
03:23:57.910 --> 03:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
and taking to the Supreme Court level
 
03:24:02.189 --> 03:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
that tells me that um there's a need for
 
03:24:04.590 --> 03:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
clarification and that there may be many
 
03:24:06.750 --> 03:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
people who don't have the means or the
 
03:24:08.269 --> 03:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
will to take something to the Supreme
 
03:24:10.830 --> 03:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
Court who are not being served in the
 
03:24:13.150 --> 03:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
way that the RSA originally
 
03:24:13.160 --> 03:24:15.469 align:start position:0%
way that the RSA originally
intended

03:24:15.469 --> 03:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
intended
 
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
um and then I
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
guess let me look at my
 
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
notes I think overall this is just
 
03:24:24.910 --> 03:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to reduce the case
 
03:24:27.229 --> 03:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
load in the court system because if we
 
03:24:30.670 --> 03:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
say here's why you can file um and
 
03:24:33.830 --> 03:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's actually respected then uh
 
03:24:34.870 --> 03:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
there'd be less
 
03:24:40.269 --> 03:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:43.189 --> 03:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you uh and thank
 
03:24:45.429 --> 03:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking the
 
03:24:45.439 --> 03:24:48.189 align:start position:0%
you for taking the
question

03:24:48.189 --> 03:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:24:52.189 --> 03:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that in your
 
03:24:54.910 --> 03:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that it's the lower courts
 
03:24:57.309 --> 03:24:57.319 align:start position:0%
that have the conclusion the the
 
03:24:59.630 --> 03:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
confusion and
 
03:25:04.110 --> 03:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has corrected them and
 
03:25:04.120 --> 03:25:05.870 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has corrected them and
they

03:25:05.870 --> 03:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
should now that they have that
 
03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
correction and that clarification there
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
should not be any more confusion
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't seem like you are trying
 
03:25:20.110 --> 03:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
to change anything policy-wise in New
 
03:25:21.950 --> 03:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
is this is the law and the Supreme Court
 
03:25:29.429 --> 03:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
even says so and so I'm
 
03:25:29.439 --> 03:25:31.349 align:start position:0%
even says so and so I'm
questioning

03:25:31.349 --> 03:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
questioning
 
03:25:35.189 --> 03:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
that if this bill is necessary because
 
03:25:37.990 --> 03:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
any confusion in the courts has been
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
clear cleared up by the Supreme Court at
 
03:25:42.309 --> 03:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
this point
 
03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question so I think if it
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
were 2010 and the much more decision had
 
03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
just come down from the Supreme Court
 
03:25:50.070 --> 03:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
you could say we figured this out we
 
03:25:51.309 --> 03:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
don't need this but then it happened
 
03:25:54.070 --> 03:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
again in 2017 with the Kelly V I don't
 
03:25:55.469 --> 03:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
remember the other name but I included
 
03:25:58.150 --> 03:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
that in your packet in the info packet
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
it's the last um Supreme Court decision
 
03:26:02.910 --> 03:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
in the info packet the fact that it
 
03:26:05.110 --> 03:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
happened again in 2017 so we have two
 
03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
cases that went all the way to Supreme
 
03:26:07.990 --> 03:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
Court on this issue which makes me think
 
03:26:09.950 --> 03:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
that there must be a lot more at the
 
03:26:11.429 --> 03:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
trial court level that never went to the
 
03:26:13.269 --> 03:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court where the confusion
 
03:26:15.950 --> 03:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
persists and you know this was only four
 
03:26:17.910 --> 03:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
or five years
 
03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
ago so I I I guess that's what I'm
 
03:26:25.110 --> 03:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
saying is that it's happening
 
03:26:27.469 --> 03:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
repetitively therefore it's on us to
 
03:26:29.870 --> 03:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
clarify the legislative intent by
 
03:26:33.269 --> 03:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
rewarding it slightly instead of relying
 
03:26:37.189 --> 03:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
on each independent trial court to and
 
03:26:38.469 --> 03:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
judge to figure it
 
03:26:42.030 --> 03:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
out through case law
 
03:26:44.590 --> 03:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
I hope that makes sense follow up yes
 
03:26:47.309 --> 03:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um do you know offand the
 
03:26:50.349 --> 03:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
reasons that the
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
modifications uh without reading the
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
entire um thing right now um why the me
 
03:27:02.229 --> 03:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
modifications happened and um or the
 
03:27:04.750 --> 03:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
reason given for them that wasn't part
 
03:27:06.990 --> 03:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:27:09.790 --> 03:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
list are you talking about in the two
 
03:27:13.150 --> 03:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases yes
 
03:27:15.469 --> 03:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
um it's it was complex it was
 
03:27:18.429 --> 03:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
complicated for me to read um but
 
03:27:20.349 --> 03:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
they're they're not that hard to find if
 
03:27:24.670 --> 03:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
you want to skim the the um conclusions
 
03:27:26.950 --> 03:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
from the Supreme Court are
 
03:27:30.070 --> 03:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
pretty obviously notated it would take a
 
03:27:32.110 --> 03:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
lot for me to find it right now on the
 
03:27:35.150 --> 03:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:43.070 align:start position:0%
 
questions

03:27:43.070 --> 03:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:27:45.189 --> 03:27:45.199 align:start position:0%

okay good afternoon we're back um I'm
 
03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
gonna open the public hearing on HB
 
03:50:32.830 --> 03:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
1382 and representative Jim kofalt will
 
03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
speak for three minutes in support of
 
03:50:35.159 --> 03:50:38.229 align:start position:0%
speak for three minutes in support of
his

03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.239 --> 03:50:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
bill

03:50:42.110 --> 03:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:45.389 --> 03:50:45.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman um as is uh
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
summarized in the first section of the
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
bill um one key purpose of this bill is
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
to establish a presumption of shared
 
03:50:57.309 --> 03:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
parenting and currently RSA 461 A6
 
03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
establishes the criteria upon which
 
03:51:02.830 --> 03:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
parenting time should be allocated and
 
03:51:04.110 --> 03:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
this includes things like the best
 
03:51:05.710 --> 03:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
interest of the child the ability for
 
03:51:07.349 --> 03:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
the parent to provide adequate food
 
03:51:10.830 --> 03:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
shelter Etc that will not change under
 
03:51:10.840 --> 03:51:11.830 align:start position:0%
shelter Etc that will not change under
this

03:51:11.830 --> 03:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill I would like to point out that um
 
03:51:20.910 --> 03:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 461 A2 currently states that the new
 
03:51:24.030 --> 03:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh has a policy
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
that unless it is clearly shown that in
 
03:51:29.389 --> 03:51:29.399 align:start position:0%
a particular case it is detrimental to a
 
03:51:33.269 --> 03:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
child um then it is best to have both
 
03:51:34.990 --> 03:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
parents have a stable and meaningful
 
03:51:37.510 --> 03:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
involvement in the children's lives um
 
03:51:39.229 --> 03:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
and therefore we should support frequent
 
03:51:41.149 --> 03:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
and continuing contact between each
 
03:51:43.389 --> 03:51:43.399 align:start position:0%
child and both parents and encourage
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
parents to share in the rights and
 
03:51:46.830 --> 03:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of raising their
 
03:51:49.349 --> 03:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
children having said that the current
 
03:51:52.189 --> 03:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
law although it implies that both
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
parents should be involved or it
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
explicitly States both should be
 
03:51:59.830 --> 03:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
involved um it does not explicitly U say
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
that the default should be 5050 shared
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
parenting and that's the the primary
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill um this would be a
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
rebuttable Pres assumption in other
 
03:52:11.750 --> 03:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
words if the court finds any cause to
 
03:52:14.189 --> 03:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
allocate custody differently that option
 
03:52:16.389 --> 03:52:16.399 align:start position:0%
is always open and there are certainly
 
03:52:18.750 --> 03:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
cases where that would be appropriate
 
03:52:20.830 --> 03:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh the bill also provides
 
03:52:23.030 --> 03:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
equal access to records including for
 
03:52:25.910 --> 03:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
example school and medical records again
 
03:52:27.870 --> 03:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
the court May rule
 
03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise the bill also gives uh
 
03:52:32.950 --> 03:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
substantial weight to the input of a
 
03:52:37.349 --> 03:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
mature child 14 years or older um it
 
03:52:39.189 --> 03:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
changes the language in the existing
 
03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
statute that would um that would allow
 
03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
for a child of any age to State a
 
03:52:46.469 --> 03:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
preference as to which parent they
 
03:52:49.630 --> 03:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
prefer to uh to spend more time with or
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
or have as their primary primary U
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
custody um this will reduce the extent
 
03:52:59.950 --> 03:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
to which children are used as Pawns in
 
03:53:02.229 --> 03:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh battles between the parents um this
 
03:53:04.269 --> 03:53:04.279 align:start position:0%
is a very damaging
 
03:53:07.510 --> 03:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
phenomenon um it is uh it's unfortunate
 
03:53:10.189 --> 03:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
it is uh psychologically tormenting for
 
03:53:15.870 --> 03:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
children and um by uh by focusing on
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
mature children 14 years or older and
 
03:53:22.510 --> 03:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
changing it from preference to input um
 
03:53:24.469 --> 03:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
our expectation is that this could
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
reduce the extent to which children are
 
03:53:29.550 --> 03:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
are uh used as Pawns in the middle of
 
03:53:32.229 --> 03:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
that battle finally this bill clarifies
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that a child if if a child is
 
03:53:37.070 --> 03:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
homeschooled that shall not be the sole
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
factor in determining whether uh
 
03:53:41.590 --> 03:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
parental parental rights and
 
03:53:44.070 --> 03:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities should be allocated
 
03:53:45.469 --> 03:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
differently than
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise um so that is the uh summary
 
03:53:52.830 --> 03:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
of the of of House Bill
 
03:53:55.790 --> 03:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
1382 and I uh I'm prepared to take
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any from the
 
03:54:00.269 --> 03:54:00.279 align:start position:0%
committee okay are there any questions
 
03:54:03.229 --> 03:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
for representative of
 
03:54:06.349 --> 03:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
kofalt Representative Banger thank you
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
03:54:10.349 --> 03:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
kall for coming today um um so looking
 
03:54:14.269 --> 03:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
at this I I kind of have uh mixed
 
03:54:15.950 --> 03:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
feelings about the way to give
 
03:54:20.149 --> 03:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
substantial weight to the uh on line 24
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
on page two um specifically it says at
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
least and at least 14 years old as
 
03:54:30.189 --> 03:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
bolded uh the court May uh give
 
03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
substantial weight to the input of the
 
03:54:34.830 --> 03:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
mature minor
 
03:54:38.070 --> 03:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
child now members of this committee we
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
often hear as members of as members of
 
03:54:43.630 --> 03:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
this committee we often hear a lot that
 
03:54:47.229 --> 03:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
judges give a they have a little bit too
 
03:54:50.910 --> 03:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
much judicial oversight
 
03:54:54.110 --> 03:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
or discretion discretion thank you uh I
 
03:54:56.710 --> 03:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
apologize I couldn't find that word so
 
03:54:59.349 --> 03:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
um I kind of foresee that as an issue
 
03:55:01.269 --> 03:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
and I want to kind of personally I've
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
seen that as an issue and I kind of want
 
03:55:03.790 --> 03:55:03.800 align:start position:0%
to scope that and bring that down a
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
little bit um have you
 
03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:09.670 align:start position:0%
little bit um have you
take

03:55:09.670 --> 03:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:55:11.229 --> 03:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
have you taken into consideration the
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
potential of that specific language to
 
03:55:16.830 --> 03:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
be a possibility that it it could add
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
more judicial discretion to the judge's
 
03:55:19.439 --> 03:55:21.149 align:start position:0%
more judicial discretion to the judge's
decision-making

03:55:21.149 --> 03:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
decision-making
 
03:55:23.550 --> 03:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
process that's an interesting point and
 
03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
I think one that that could certainly be
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
considered we could look at potential
 
03:55:32.309 --> 03:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
ways to uh to to rephrase or modify that
 
03:55:36.030 --> 03:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
um I think the the the concern that led
 
03:55:38.149 --> 03:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
to this proposed change in the in the
 
03:55:38.159 --> 03:55:39.550 align:start position:0%
to this proposed change in the in the
language

03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
um is
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
that asking a young child in particular
 
03:55:47.250 --> 03:55:47.260 align:start position:0%
to State a preference
 
03:55:47.260 --> 03:55:48.710 align:start position:0%
to State a preference
[Music]

03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:55:52.030 --> 03:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
um is I think a you know a commonly used
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
tactic when parents are trying to sort
 
03:55:55.870 --> 03:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
of pit the child against the other
 
03:55:59.590 --> 03:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
parent and that this kind of encourages
 
03:56:02.830 --> 03:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
a a damaging um kind of behavior among
 
03:56:05.630 --> 03:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
the parents um having said that I hear
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
your concern I I think it's it's a valid
 
03:56:11.389 --> 03:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
concerned that um there's quite a lot of
 
03:56:13.710 --> 03:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
latitude in in many of these
 
03:56:16.910 --> 03:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
cases um in fact you know one of the
 
03:56:18.830 --> 03:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
things that this bill would do would be
 
03:56:23.229 --> 03:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
to um require the court to to to provide
 
03:56:25.870 --> 03:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
substantiation for any deviation from
 
03:56:27.950 --> 03:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
50-50 parenting so in in a lot of
 
03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
respects I see this as a bill that's
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
intended to um to clarify and provide
 
03:56:36.670 --> 03:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
guidance um rather than
 
03:56:39.630 --> 03:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
providing perhaps too much lat attitude
 
03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's a valid concern U but
 
03:56:44.429 --> 03:56:44.439 align:start position:0%
I think it's also it's offsetting
 
03:56:46.990 --> 03:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
another very very important concern
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
about uh what's happening to children in
 
03:56:50.510 --> 03:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of these
 
03:56:52.349 --> 03:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
cases follow
 
03:56:55.990 --> 03:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
up the other thing that I was um
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
wondering is why you decide thank you
 
03:56:59.550 --> 03:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
for answering the question I greatly
 
03:57:02.790 --> 03:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate it sorry about that um is
 
03:57:05.309 --> 03:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
what decision making went into the the
 
03:57:05.319 --> 03:57:06.590 align:start position:0%
what decision making went into the the
effective

03:57:06.590 --> 03:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
effective
 
03:57:11.790 --> 03:57:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:13.229 --> 03:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
I like to see something take effect
 
03:57:16.750 --> 03:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
after 60 days for example to um give the
 
03:57:18.790 --> 03:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
Court's substantial time but not enough
 
03:57:20.189 --> 03:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
substantial time where it's taking too
 
03:57:24.189 --> 03:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
long for that to um to take
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
effect I'm certainly open to to seeing
 
03:57:30.309 --> 03:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
that change I I I think the idea there
 
03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
really is that you know this this will
 
03:57:36.149 --> 03:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
there will be some time required for for
 
03:57:39.870 --> 03:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
the courts to adjust to the new law and
 
03:57:42.590 --> 03:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
to adopt that in in their cases so I I
 
03:57:45.550 --> 03:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
just I think uh you know it's it's not
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
one of these laws that could probably be
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh implemented immediately 60 days might
 
03:57:53.510 --> 03:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
be appropriate um I I think it it could
 
03:57:54.750 --> 03:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
easily be
 
03:57:57.870 --> 03:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
changed thank you no further question
 
03:57:59.670 --> 03:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
03:58:01.750 --> 03:58:01.760 align:start position:0%

shared parenting and I ask for your

03:58:43.349 --> 03:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
the past several months I've heard
 
03:58:46.870 --> 03:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
testimony from many New Hampshire
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
parents regarding uh their children who
 
03:58:53.309 --> 03:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
have been negatively impacted by the
 
03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
family court system that clearly does
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
not have the best interest of the child
 
03:59:01.389 --> 03:59:01.399 align:start position:0%
at heart in
 
03:59:04.149 --> 03:59:04.159 align:start position:0%

need to we need to make sure that the
 
04:01:06.070 --> 04:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
judges don't uh use their discretion
 
04:01:08.670 --> 04:01:08.680 align:start position:0%

04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
that are the C courts not holding her
 
04:10:11.149 --> 04:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
they've done
 
04:10:13.870 --> 04:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
nothing so they had a 2009 court order
 
04:10:15.990 --> 04:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
they never used they came up with an
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
implemented a 5050 shared parenting plan
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
they used that for eight years was that
 
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
on paper and signed by a judge no that's
 
04:10:26.109 --> 04:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
why he can't get access to the record he
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
can't even no because he still has joint
 
04:10:30.910 --> 04:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
decision even from the 2009 but the
 
04:10:34.269 --> 04:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
school is not allowing him the
 
04:10:36.750 --> 04:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
pediatrician won't send him and this kid
 
04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
has had has horrific things that I don't
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
want to get into because it's one thing
 
04:10:44.189 --> 04:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say to you even if you have
 
04:10:47.189 --> 04:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
an agreement doesn't matter go get it
 
04:10:49.630 --> 04:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
signed by a judge you know because you
 
04:10:51.910 --> 04:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
can follow that agreement for 10 years
 
04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
and someone gets in a mood right right
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
but they're not sh they're not even
 
04:11:00.309 --> 04:11:00.319 align:start position:0%
following the court order and the courts
 
04:11:01.950 --> 04:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything nothing they won't
 
04:11:01.960 --> 04:11:03.269 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything nothing they won't
even

04:11:03.269 --> 04:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
even
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
address his emotional mental state right
 
04:11:08.590 --> 04:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
now is bad
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any further
 
04:11:19.630 --> 04:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
much okay up next is um Brenda town to
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%

04:11:36.359 --> 04:11:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
you

I'm here to ask your support on HB
 
04:11:53.309 --> 04:11:53.319 align:start position:0%
1382 um again my name is Brenda town and
 
04:11:55.229 --> 04:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
I am a mother of four kids and a
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
grandmother of eight children and in
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
2018 um my family uh
 
04:12:04.750 --> 04:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
experienced um the trauma of Family
 
04:12:09.550 --> 04:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
Court um my middle a my th um ended up
 
04:12:11.910 --> 04:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh in a very contentious divorce
 
04:12:13.950 --> 04:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
situation where the infamous Silver
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
Bullet uh with false accusations of
 
04:12:20.070 --> 04:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
abuse and crimes were used as leverage
 
04:12:24.030 --> 04:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
to Pro to uh position in um The Family
 
04:12:26.950 --> 04:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
Court environment um the good news is
 
04:12:29.710 --> 04:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
that after six months of not seeing um
 
04:12:31.870 --> 04:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
the grandchildren and his kids we were
 
04:12:33.389 --> 04:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
able to work our way through those
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
things but it was incredibly uh
 
04:12:39.510 --> 04:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
traumatized iing to my family and to the
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
children and to him he had been an
 
04:12:45.750 --> 04:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
Engaged dad um uh honorably discharged
 
04:12:48.790 --> 04:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
Marine um actively involved no history
 
04:12:50.910 --> 04:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
of abuse and yet when he entered into
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
Family Court when he went to seek
 
04:12:55.510 --> 04:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
parenting uh time for his kids he was
 
04:12:57.870 --> 04:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
immediately hamstrung on trying to get
 
04:13:00.510 --> 04:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
shared parenting and with that it it it
 
04:13:03.870 --> 04:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
created a an unlikely passionate parent
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
advocate in me and I became the leader
 
04:13:09.550 --> 04:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
of a parent um organization here in New
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for parents who were
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
struggling with uh the family court
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
issues with over 5,000 uh folks uh
 
04:13:19.070 --> 04:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
participating and following us on
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
Facebook um I would on a daily basis
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
help these parents who would message me
 
04:13:27.990 --> 04:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
and um really help them try to triage
 
04:13:31.710 --> 04:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
their situation and in most all of the
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
cases where they were suffering the most
 
04:13:36.630 --> 04:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
was in regards to this shared parenting
 
04:13:38.950 --> 04:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
they were struggling because they wanted
 
04:13:41.149 --> 04:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
to be actively engaged in their kids'
 
04:13:44.429 --> 04:13:44.439 align:start position:0%
lives but um they had to fight it became
 
04:13:46.349 --> 04:13:46.359 align:start position:0%
kind of a beauty contest if you will
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
when they went into Family Court where
 
04:13:50.590 --> 04:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
they were trying to position themselves
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
to be an equal participant as a parents
 
04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
so they could see their kids on an equal
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
basis so with my exposure to all of this
 
04:14:01.790 --> 04:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
it I it also led me I am now the
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
director of the um National Parents
 
04:14:06.189 --> 04:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
organization here in New Hampshire where
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
I I do work with parents who are
 
04:14:11.309 --> 04:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
struggling with uh issues and again the
 
04:14:13.469 --> 04:14:13.479 align:start position:0%
uh issue around parenting time is
 
04:14:16.269 --> 04:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
tantamount with the research shows us
 
04:14:18.990 --> 04:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
and it's very clear that these
 
04:14:23.269 --> 04:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
households that are broken um if we can
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
maintain equal parenting time for our
 
04:14:29.070 --> 04:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
kids uh with equal quality time with
 
04:14:31.389 --> 04:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
their parents we will create an outcome
 
04:14:34.469 --> 04:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
in those kids that is most like intact
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
families there's uh less depression less
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
anxiety more success at school less
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
teenage pregnancy these things are an
 
04:14:45.750 --> 04:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
outcome of meaningful participation of
 
04:14:49.109 --> 04:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
two parents in our current situation it
 
04:14:52.469 --> 04:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
is ambiguous when a family goes in on
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
how that parenting plan will land and
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
because of that gray area it leaves us
 
04:15:01.710 --> 04:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
open to very large times of litigation
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
which set a foundation of acrimony that
 
04:15:06.349 --> 04:15:06.359 align:start position:0%
linger through the rest of the time that
 
04:15:07.710 --> 04:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
those kids have to to be raised and
 
04:15:11.149 --> 04:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
parented between um the two parents so
 
04:15:13.630 --> 04:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would remove the um ambiguous
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
nature it would allow for standards with
 
04:15:20.070 --> 04:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
discretion um as well documented by our
 
04:15:22.950 --> 04:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
judges if they need to deviate from this
 
04:15:25.149 --> 04:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
which is very important for families
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
today in family court because that does
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
not exist when um a decision is made in
 
04:15:33.269 --> 04:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
all cases so very important for them the
 
04:15:34.630 --> 04:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
other thing that I wanted to leave you
 
04:15:37.309 --> 04:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
with is that in 2018 we do have have an
 
04:15:40.229 --> 04:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
example in Kentucky where they passed a
 
04:15:42.269 --> 04:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
5050 shared parenting bill it's the
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
oldest example we have and this bill
 
04:15:48.670 --> 04:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
within one year reduced family court
 
04:15:52.030 --> 04:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
cases by 11% because parents no longer
 
04:15:54.109 --> 04:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
had to fight on their way in the door it
 
04:15:56.670 --> 04:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
helped resolve that issue for them the
 
04:15:58.510 --> 04:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
other interesting thing which ties
 
04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
directly into my family story is 10% of
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
all the domestic violence uh cases were
 
04:16:07.149 --> 04:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
dropped as well because there was no no
 
04:16:10.469 --> 04:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
longer um the necessity of a tool to
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
position position yourself um as the
 
04:16:15.950 --> 04:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
stronger parent in entering family court
 
04:16:18.990 --> 04:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
and so again um we just ask your support
 
04:16:22.469 --> 04:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
for this bill to remedy this very clear
 
04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
outline of what shared parenting should
 
04:16:27.790 --> 04:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
be unless there is a meaningful reasons
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
why it shouldn't be 50-50 shared
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
parenting and we ask that you will help
 
04:16:34.349 --> 04:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
us close this Gap so that our kids in
 
04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
this state have access to both parents
 
04:16:39.070 --> 04:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
and we create the healthiest future
 
04:16:41.429 --> 04:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire we possibly
 
04:16:46.349 --> 04:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:48.830 --> 04:16:48.840 align:start position:0%

dear children and family law committee

Representatives I am strongly in support
 
04:17:40.189 --> 04:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
of HB 1382 from 2022 an act relative to
 
04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
the presumption of shared parenting in
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
the determination of parental rights and
 
04:17:46.269 --> 04:17:46.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as a licensed clinical
 
04:17:48.109 --> 04:17:48.119 align:start position:0%
mental health counselor for close to 20
 
04:17:50.070 --> 04:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
years I have treated several women and
 
04:17:52.590 --> 04:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
men who have been subject to poor and
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
bias decisions from the family courts in
 
04:17:57.030 --> 04:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
all cases if there had been a
 
04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
presumption for Shared Parenting the
 
04:18:02.109 --> 04:18:02.119 align:start position:0%
pain inflicted on the targeted parent
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
and children would not have occurred and
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
would not have left scar life life left
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
lifetime scars the lifetime scars
 
04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
including several
 
04:18:14.229 --> 04:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
alternating several alienating
 
04:18:16.510 --> 04:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
relationships a child or children have
 
04:18:19.469 --> 04:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
had with a responsible loving parent in
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
other words using a child or children as
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
a weapon against a targeted parent in
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
all cases there were guardi lims
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
involved that for all intents and
 
04:18:30.510 --> 04:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
purposes appeared biased against the
 
04:18:33.269 --> 04:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
targeted parent unfortunately in most of
 
04:18:35.109 --> 04:18:35.119 align:start position:0%
the cases it was the parent who could
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
also not afford adequate with legal
 
04:18:40.189 --> 04:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
representation Andor ability to pay part
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the Guardian liem fee that was
 
04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
targeted in treating adults involved in
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
these types of cases the harm that is
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
done is very difficult to repair
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
especially when unfair custody decis
 
04:18:55.950 --> 04:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
custody decisions are made in many cases
 
04:18:58.590 --> 04:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
due to biased or blatant lies regarding
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
the targeted parent while the gals in
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
the court would not consider the
 
04:19:06.149 --> 04:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
evidence presented showing what was said
 
04:19:08.830 --> 04:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
Etc where blatant lies or biased
 
04:19:11.389 --> 04:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
opinions is difficult to comprehend in
 
04:19:13.630 --> 04:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
addition to the targeted parent in
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
addition the targeted parent suffers
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
profound grief over the loss of time
 
04:19:19.990 --> 04:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
with a child or children which can
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
evolve into full-blown depressive
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
episodes requiring medication and
 
04:19:26.590 --> 04:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
therapy to resolve to an acceptable
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
level in several cases women and men
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
were emotionally or verbally abused by
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
the other party with evidence of such
 
04:19:35.229 --> 04:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
submitted to the court and still the
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
court decided in favor of the the abuser
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
and ignored the evidence in at least
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
three cases there was direct evidence of
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
Parental alienation there was also
 
04:19:47.070 --> 04:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
evidence of undesirable and improper
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
influences such as influences that was
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
also ignored in the Court's decision in
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
all cases the children were offered
 
04:19:57.030 --> 04:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
material Goods that targeted the parent
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
that could not afford and thus
 
04:20:00.990 --> 04:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
manipulating the children to side
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
against the targeted parent they were
 
04:20:05.149 --> 04:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
also offered fund vacations expens
 
04:20:07.309 --> 04:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
expensive Electronics pets and sports of
 
04:20:10.389 --> 04:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
their choice Etc these actions taken by
 
04:20:12.189 --> 04:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
the other party truly constitute child
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
abuse due to the long-term damage that
 
04:20:16.229 --> 04:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
is done both to how the child will
 
04:20:19.229 --> 04:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
mature in the dis Distortion done to the
 
04:20:20.910 --> 04:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
previous loving relationship they had
 
04:20:23.149 --> 04:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
with the targeted parent shared
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
parenting would certainly help to
 
04:20:27.710 --> 04:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
mitigate conflict and as research has
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
shown even in cases where there's high
 
04:20:31.590 --> 04:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
conflict in the divorce or custody
 
04:20:33.510 --> 04:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
proceedings the children continue to do
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
well in shared parenting situations
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
versus sole custody
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
shared parenting treats both parents as
 
04:20:41.229 --> 04:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
equal and eliminates children from being
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
treated as property to be fought over
 
04:20:45.269 --> 04:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
and shared parenting children will
 
04:20:47.030 --> 04:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
continue to build strong attachment
 
04:20:48.750 --> 04:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
bonds with both parents leading to
 
04:20:50.550 --> 04:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
better mental health outcomes later in
 
04:20:53.229 --> 04:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
life the exception to using the
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
presumption of shared parenting would be
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
in cases where there is domestic
 
04:20:58.510 --> 04:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
violence child abuse of any kind severe
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
drug drug addiction untreat treated
 
04:21:02.670 --> 04:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
mental illness or other criminal
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
activity which would negatively impact
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
the welfare of a child or children
 
04:21:09.670 --> 04:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully submitted Sheila Gunther
 
04:21:11.490 --> 04:21:11.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
04:21:11.500 --> 04:21:13.590 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
[Music]

04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:21:15.870 --> 04:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
so I was under the assumption you were
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
going to be reading for someone that was
 
04:21:21.269 --> 04:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
here that was perhaps too emotional to
 
04:21:23.950 --> 04:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to speak I just want to make
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
it clear that in the future I will not
 
04:21:28.389 --> 04:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
accept someone reading someone else's
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
testimony who is not here because we
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
cannot question that person we did
 
04:21:36.870 --> 04:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
receive an email from this person so so
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
they've testified but what'll happen is
 
04:21:42.189 --> 04:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
next week I'll get people coming in here
 
04:21:44.149 --> 04:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
saying I need to read the testimony of
 
04:21:46.910 --> 04:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
these 20 people and those are 20 people
 
04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
that we cannot
 
04:21:52.429 --> 04:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
question okay so that was my mistake but
 
04:21:53.950 --> 04:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to set the record straight
 
04:21:56.030 --> 04:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
for right now that it will not happen
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
again in the future okay I'm I'm Sorry
 
04:22:01.349 --> 04:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
Miss Madam chair thank you it's it's not
 
04:22:03.189 --> 04:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
your fault it was my fault I made an
 
04:22:05.469 --> 04:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
assumption so you know what they you
 
04:22:08.429 --> 04:22:08.439 align:start position:0%
know so that's my fault um so up next

disabilities which I won't get into
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
today but I've been a fierce Advocate at
 
04:22:56.590 --> 04:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
the state level uh and locally and
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
within the schools for that
 
04:23:01.030 --> 04:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
child the current standard as most of us
 
04:23:04.510 --> 04:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
are aware are that one parent 80% of the
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
time ends up being the father that is
 
04:23:08.149 --> 04:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
only Ed in every other weekend type
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:15.109 --> 04:23:15.119 align:start position:0%
children typically the judge will award
 
04:23:18.109 --> 04:23:18.119 align:start position:0%
this as a standard and tries to pick the
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
best parent using Guardian items or
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
maybe uh that particular individual had
 
04:23:25.750 --> 04:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
a bad day in court when they went to
 
04:23:27.309 --> 04:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
represent or couldn't have legal
 
04:23:29.910 --> 04:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
representation to help get them a 50-50
 
04:23:29.920 --> 04:23:31.590 align:start position:0%
representation to help get them a 50-50
shared

04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
shared
 
04:23:34.870 --> 04:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
parenting when parents are together they
 
04:23:37.149 --> 04:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
both contribute how the child is raised
 
04:23:39.630 --> 04:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
their values beliefs and help mold a
 
04:23:42.309 --> 04:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
child into little versions of
 
04:23:44.910 --> 04:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
themselves which we all hope they take
 
04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
the best qualities from each parent some
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
parents will nurture some will teach
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
some are quiet some are outspoken some
 
04:23:56.670 --> 04:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
watch TV some teach Adventure some cook
 
04:23:58.910 --> 04:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
some teach how to change attire at the
 
04:24:02.510 --> 04:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
end of the day as one we are the best
 
04:24:05.550 --> 04:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
when one parent only shares 10% of that
 
04:24:07.710 --> 04:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
child's time the children doesn't get
 
04:24:09.550 --> 04:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to become
 
04:24:12.149 --> 04:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
whole I was a victim of the every other
 
04:24:14.550 --> 04:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
weekend parent plan when I was a child
 
04:24:17.710 --> 04:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
some 30 years ago to this day I still
 
04:24:19.269 --> 04:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
believe that my relationship with my
 
04:24:21.429 --> 04:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
father is still tarnished we've tried to
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
repair it we still still spend time
 
04:24:25.630 --> 04:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
together but it never feels like that
 
04:24:27.870 --> 04:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
same connection of a bond that I strive
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
to have with my own children especially
 
04:24:31.710 --> 04:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
my 17-year-old which I spent a
 
04:24:33.469 --> 04:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of time with since he
 
04:24:35.309 --> 04:24:35.319 align:start position:0%
is still the one that is is we're
 
04:24:38.189 --> 04:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
working on with it a current child uh
 
04:24:38.199 --> 04:24:39.189 align:start position:0%
working on with it a current child uh
parenting

04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
plan my son is now becoming that same
 
04:24:45.070 --> 04:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:48.630 --> 04:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
was so now my son misses time with me
 
04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
that is only allowed by the other parent
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
when she chooses to De deviate from the
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
parent plan he's missing school

04:25:08.070 --> 04:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
parent I've struggled to try to make
 
04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
sure as a father that under these
 
04:25:13.389 --> 04:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances my relationship stays
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
strong with my son and that my bond with
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
my child children are not affected in
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
the same way mine
 
04:25:25.149 --> 04:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
was I support this bill so I can help
 
04:25:26.750 --> 04:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
end the struggle that many parents
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
continue to go through we must end this
 
04:25:31.630 --> 04:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
cycle that the nation not just New
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but the nation has of having
 
04:25:37.229 --> 04:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
these divisive situations
 
04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.950 --> 04:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
whole now to give you a quick little
 
04:25:46.950 --> 04:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
story I'm the kind of parent that
 
04:25:49.229 --> 04:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
attends IEP meetings I do homework with
 
04:25:52.030 --> 04:25:52.040 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire 4,000 Footers I've visited
 
04:26:03.950 --> 04:26:03.960 align:start position:0%

04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
continue to be active in the community
 
04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
teach them Personal Care I've coached I
 
04:26:15.630 --> 04:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
attend every sporting event for my
 
04:26:17.990 --> 04:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
children and as I've mentioned before
 
04:26:19.630 --> 04:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
I'm a fierce Advocate with disabilities
 
04:26:21.550 --> 04:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
and I've spoken at the State House on
 
04:26:24.750 --> 04:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of disabilities many times am I
 
04:26:26.830 --> 04:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
truly with that description a parent
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
that should only have 10% of the time
 
04:26:30.990 --> 04:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
with my children unfortunately this is
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:35.000 --> 04:26:38.389 align:start position:0%
 
there

04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:40.710 --> 04:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
and and I support part of that bill that
 
04:26:43.349 --> 04:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
even speaks in the that this should be
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
presumption from the when the temp
 
04:26:47.269 --> 04:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
orders are given I've been going through
 
04:26:48.910 --> 04:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
a court battle for over three and a half
 
04:26:51.429 --> 04:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
years when my son I think he was 14 at
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
the time so very formative years from 14
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
to 18 that he's missing out on having me
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
side by side and making sure he's going
 
04:27:01.030 --> 04:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
the right line I try and I try to make
 
04:27:02.830 --> 04:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm there with
 
04:27:05.109 --> 04:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
him previously I'm not sure if it was
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
very clear but two states have passed
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
this shared parenting law back in 1990
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire led the
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
nation in closing it State schools
 
04:27:18.910 --> 04:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
institutions for those with disabilities
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
we led the way in 1990 in changing how
 
04:27:25.269 --> 04:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
the nation thinks we must once again do
 
04:27:27.710 --> 04:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
that be number three in passing this
 
04:27:29.349 --> 04:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
bill so that we can change how the rest
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
of the nation continues to think parents
 
04:27:33.309 --> 04:27:33.319 align:start position:0%
should not have to fight for the
 
04:27:34.670 --> 04:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights to be in their
 
04:27:37.030 --> 04:27:37.040 align:start position:0%

April 8th
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
2016 it's received both coverage in the
 
04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire union leader and uh
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
National coverage um that's the handout
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
is not my testimony it's just in support
 
04:28:48.990 --> 04:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
oh okay I'm like what is this this not
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
testimony don't spend a lot of time
 
04:28:52.590 --> 04:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
reading that right
 
04:28:52.600 --> 04:28:54.830 align:start position:0%
reading that right
now

04:28:54.830 --> 04:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh so I've been in this my family's been
 
04:29:00.750 --> 04:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
in the system five years since uh April
 
04:29:00.760 --> 04:29:01.950 align:start position:0%
in the system five years since uh April
8th

04:29:01.950 --> 04:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
8th
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
2016 with countless different judges uh
 
04:29:10.109 --> 04:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh I just now got uh yet another new
 
04:29:13.109 --> 04:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
judge uh and he just got even appointed
 
04:29:18.189 --> 04:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
as a judge uh six months ago so uh any
 
04:29:20.550 --> 04:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
bills that can make his life easier are
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
a good thing because uh even he's new
 
04:29:23.040 --> 04:29:23.830 align:start position:0%
a good thing because uh even he's new
with

04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:29:27.950 --> 04:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
this uh just a brief background on my
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
case uh and then I'll speak to the
 
04:29:32.070 --> 04:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
particulars of the
 
04:29:37.590 --> 04:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh so uh prior to that I had judge
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
Paul Moore and judge incasso who were
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
both uh later uh charged with felonies
 
04:29:45.910 --> 04:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
and are now Off the
 
04:29:49.870 --> 04:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
Bench uh judge in traso appointed her
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
best friend Kathleen sternenberg as G in
 
04:29:56.590 --> 04:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
my case I'm one of the nine cases in
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
which he did that as a conflict of
 
04:30:01.750 --> 04:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
interest and that's the handout I'm sure
 
04:30:03.189 --> 04:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
you can look at it
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
later um Master Del pra
 
04:30:08.670 --> 04:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
was aware of that conflict since
 
04:30:13.469 --> 04:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:13.479 --> 04:30:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
me

04:30:15.910 --> 04:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:30:18.189 --> 04:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
um moving
 
04:30:22.510 --> 04:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
forward uh Master uh Dow pra concerning
 
04:30:27.950 --> 04:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
my family CA law case said in open court
 
04:30:30.429 --> 04:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
who gives an
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
FK concerning testimoni and evidence
 
04:30:37.309 --> 04:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that's me uh and called my kids
 
04:30:41.550 --> 04:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
morons uh and again all that's kind of
 
04:30:43.830 --> 04:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
in the union leader if the committee
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
wants those articles I can get them to
 
04:30:48.830 --> 04:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
you but I don't have them with me
 
04:30:48.840 --> 04:30:50.710 align:start position:0%
you but I don't have them with me
today

04:30:50.710 --> 04:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
um so less about judicial
 
04:30:57.710 --> 04:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
misconduct but there's plenty of good
 
04:31:00.910 --> 04:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
judges out there honest judges out there
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
and we need to make their lives easy
 
04:31:06.109 --> 04:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
with good legislation
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
that they can figure out and lessens
 
04:31:08.600 --> 04:31:09.389 align:start position:0%
that they can figure out and lessens
their

04:31:09.389 --> 04:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
workload so the way things work in
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
family court right now is a lot of the
 
04:31:18.990 --> 04:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings are really about who's the
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
quote better
 
04:31:26.109 --> 04:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
parent and if you go to a lot of Court
 
04:31:27.750 --> 04:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
hearings they'll devolve into the
 
04:31:30.109 --> 04:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
ridiculous like whether Mom put matching
 
04:31:32.670 --> 04:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
kids on the socks to go to school
 
04:31:35.189 --> 04:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
whether peanut butter and jelly or smoke
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
sand in is better as a sandwich and just
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
stuff that has no place in deciding
 
04:31:43.710 --> 04:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
custody because they make it about who's
 
04:31:49.030 --> 04:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
the better parent and that's just
 
04:31:49.040 --> 04:31:52.910 align:start position:0%
the better parent and that's just
wrong

04:31:52.910 --> 04:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:52.920 --> 04:31:54.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
so in a normal family Dynamic realizing
 
04:32:01.349 --> 04:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
there's exceptions
 
04:32:06.590 --> 04:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
kids naturally want to love both parents
 
04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
both parents naturally love their
 
04:32:11.870 --> 04:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
children their children want to have a
 
04:32:14.910 --> 04:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
positive relationship with both parents
 
04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
that's the ideal even divorce is not the
 
04:32:19.990 --> 04:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
ideal but if we're going to go through
 
04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
it let's maintain the positive
 
04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
relationship with both parents and have
 
04:32:27.269 --> 04:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
a presumption of
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
that um this would have
 
04:32:30.239 --> 04:32:33.349 align:start position:0%
that um this would have
gone

04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
just a tremendous this way towards
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
preventing the tragedy of my case I mean
 
04:32:43.950 --> 04:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
we've been in the system five
 
04:32:43.960 --> 04:32:45.469 align:start position:0%
we've been in the system five
years

04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:32:48.830 --> 04:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
and the guardian ad lium Kathleen
 
04:32:51.149 --> 04:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
sternenberg decided it would be in the
 
04:32:53.189 --> 04:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
best interest of my daughters both of
 
04:32:56.229 --> 04:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
whom were born in nashille and new H
 
04:33:00.189 --> 04:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me in New Hampshire to relocate
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
to Pasadena
 
04:33:04.150 --> 04:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
California at the time my daughter's 8
 
04:33:06.629 --> 04:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
years old at the time
 
04:33:10.869 --> 04:33:10.879 align:start position:0%
um and uh Kathleen sternenberg decided
 
04:33:13.189 --> 04:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
she was a mature minor according to the
 
04:33:15.910 --> 04:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
current statute and that that would
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
carry all the weight because she liked
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
her California
 
04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
Vacations so she should move there can I
 
04:33:25.830 --> 04:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
ask you a really quick question um was
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
that a recommendation she made to the
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
judge uh yes I can also what year was
 
04:33:36.189 --> 04:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
that uh the hearing was in
 
04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
2017 something I'd like to provide the
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee I only have one copy with me
 
04:33:44.230 --> 04:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
today but I can submited after the fact
 
04:33:46.390 --> 04:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
is the written transcript of Mr
 
04:33:48.830 --> 04:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
stenberg's testimony in my case or at
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
least make that available to the
 
04:33:52.910 --> 04:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee so I guess my question is did
 
04:33:54.869 --> 04:33:54.879 align:start position:0%
did the judge ask her a question or did
 
04:33:57.869 --> 04:33:57.879 align:start position:0%
she write a recommendation she wrote a
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.279 --> 04:34:07.109 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh so since that
 
04:34:12.990 --> 04:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
time uh my kids have relocated multiple
 
04:34:15.551 --> 04:34:15.561 align:start position:0%
times first from Hollis New Hampshire
 
04:34:18.269 --> 04:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
then to Sierra Madre California then to
 
04:34:21.150 --> 04:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
Pasadena California and most recently to
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
East China
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
Michigan uh all as a consequence of her
 
04:34:30.070 --> 04:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation um and that's LED rise to
 
04:34:32.830 --> 04:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
A multi-state diversity of citizenship
 
04:34:36.510 --> 04:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
family law case Under the UCC J EA for
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement so now we've got an
 
04:34:40.949 --> 04:34:40.959 align:start position:0%
enforcement Docket in California we've
 
04:34:43.109 --> 04:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
got an enforcement Docket in Michigan
 
04:34:45.429 --> 04:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
and then we have the primary docket here
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire retains primary
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and all of this could have
 
04:34:53.551 --> 04:34:53.561 align:start position:0%
been prevented with a simple
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
presumption of shared
 
04:34:58.629 --> 04:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
parenting and over the course of the
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
past five years I've maybe gotten to see
 
04:35:04.910 --> 04:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
my younger kids a total of 30 40 days
 
04:35:08.709 --> 04:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
because they keep moving and the courts
 
04:35:10.150 --> 04:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know again some of these corrupt
 
04:35:12.551 --> 04:35:12.561 align:start position:0%
judges have been simply unwilling to
 
04:35:14.470 --> 04:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
enforce even the parenting plan they
 
04:35:14.480 --> 04:35:16.629 align:start position:0%
enforce even the parenting plan they
gave

04:35:16.629 --> 04:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
gave
 
04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
me if I could ask um at some point could
 
04:35:27.109 --> 04:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
you send me a copy of that um the gal
 
04:35:30.029 --> 04:35:30.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation that she wrote absolutely
 
04:35:30.039 --> 04:35:34.189 align:start position:0%
recommendation that she wrote absolutely
thank

04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.199 --> 04:35:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh so one of the things I want to speak
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
to on the bill itself which is echoing
 
04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
some of Brenda Town's testimony that
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
really hit
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
home is let's face it I'm in a high
 
04:35:52.680 --> 04:35:54.150 align:start position:0%
home is let's face it I'm in a high
conflict

04:35:54.150 --> 04:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
04:35:57.510 --> 04:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
divorce and if there's
 
04:36:00.269 --> 04:36:00.279 align:start position:0%
a presumption that the parents are just
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
going to get equal parenting time to
 
04:36:03.789 --> 04:36:03.799 align:start position:0%
begin with again
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
presumption then that's going to cut
 
04:36:10.390 --> 04:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
down tremendously on parents efforts to
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
manipulate kids into favoring one parent
 
04:36:14.551 --> 04:36:14.561 align:start position:0%
over the
 
04:36:18.310 --> 04:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
other uh I think the quantitative
 
04:36:20.750 --> 04:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
evidence that the committee heard
 
04:36:24.269 --> 04:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
earlier supports that it's really going
 
04:36:27.070 --> 04:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
to cut down on a lot of the things we
 
04:36:30.029 --> 04:36:30.039 align:start position:0%
heard earlier about you know one parent
 
04:36:34.470 --> 04:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get a kid on their side you
 
04:36:37.510 --> 04:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
know with expensive gifts you name it
 
04:36:40.629 --> 04:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
vacations if we just start out with the
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
no you know you're getting the kids
 
04:36:46.349 --> 04:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
equal time absent a compelling clear and
 
04:36:48.189 --> 04:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
convincing reason why that's not a good
 
04:36:52.029 --> 04:36:52.039 align:start position:0%
idea just cuts down on conflict in
 
04:36:52.039 --> 04:36:53.551 align:start position:0%
idea just cuts down on conflict in
families

04:36:53.551 --> 04:36:53.561 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:36:57.109 --> 04:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
um and sort of when we have all this
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
conflict with kids trying to to
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
manipulate parents trying to manipulate
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
kids into spending more time with one
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
parent or the
 
04:37:09.629 --> 04:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
other uh then that's just extremely
 
04:37:14.310 --> 04:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
emotionally damaging to the kids and you
 
04:37:18.709 --> 04:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
know I've lived it yeah so I I just
 
04:37:21.789 --> 04:37:21.799 align:start position:0%
think having this would really cut down
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
on the efforts it makes lives easier for
 
04:37:27.070 --> 04:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
the judges to just kind of go yeah no
 
04:37:29.189 --> 04:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
this is what we're doing unless
 
04:37:30.910 --> 04:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's got some clear and convincing
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
evidence otherwise um how much time do I
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
have left oh I wasn't really counting
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
but we don't want to go on forever
 
04:37:41.910 --> 04:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
because you start to your audience am I
 
04:37:44.390 --> 04:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
am I am done but I could speak to one
 
04:37:46.830 --> 04:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
other portion of the bill Depending on
 
04:37:50.590 --> 04:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
time go right ahead
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh which uh forgive me one moment let me
 
04:37:58.429 --> 04:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:00.830 --> 04:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
here uh so we spoke to the at least
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
14year old part which I think is very
 
04:38:07.390 --> 04:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
important we spoke to equal
 
04:38:11.310 --> 04:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
parenting uh I'd like to speak to the
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
part except as otherwise
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
cuded uh professional public or private
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
institution organization denies access
 
04:38:23.310 --> 04:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
to records I just wanted to say that's
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
been a huge problem in my case and it's
 
04:38:28.029 --> 04:38:28.039 align:start position:0%
been exacerbated because we're dealing
 
04:38:28.039 --> 04:38:28.990 align:start position:0%
been exacerbated because we're dealing
with

04:38:28.990 --> 04:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:38:32.750 --> 04:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
multi-state stuff and because I was
 
04:38:34.109 --> 04:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
going to say I mean I'm not sure how
 
04:38:36.189 --> 04:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
much we canfor Force anything from
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
another state to another state um I
 
04:38:46.269 --> 04:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
think under the ucj we can but what's
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
coming out of New Hampshire right now is
 
04:38:49.990 --> 04:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
really confusing
 
04:38:53.830 --> 04:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
orders simply because there's so much
 
04:38:56.590 --> 04:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
discretion and so much crazy on the
 
04:38:58.990 --> 04:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
socks and the the salmon
 
04:39:01.590 --> 04:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
sandwiches and these huge narrative
 
04:39:04.269 --> 04:39:04.279 align:start position:0%
orders and a judge from another state
 
04:39:06.310 --> 04:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
you know they eyes glaze
 
04:39:09.629 --> 04:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
over and so if we can get nice simple
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
clean orders with nice simple clean
 
04:39:16.150 --> 04:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
legislation then a judge from another
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
state an enforcement can go oh yeah I
 
04:39:18.799 --> 04:39:19.590 align:start position:0%
state an enforcement can go oh yeah I
get

04:39:19.590 --> 04:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
it and we're all set um I think that
 
04:39:26.910 --> 04:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
concludes the remarks I'd like to make
 
04:39:28.510 --> 04:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh happy to follow up later with
 
04:39:30.670 --> 04:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
anything written and certainly would
 
04:39:33.310 --> 04:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
like to take questions if anyone has any
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
04:39:36.760 --> 04:39:39.708 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
representative

04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
Banger thank you and um thank you madam
 
04:39:44.150 --> 04:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
04:39:46.230 --> 04:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry for what you having to deal
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
with but thank you to to your comment
 
04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
about um judicial discretion yes I
 
04:39:58.590 --> 04:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
brought up on page two line 24 through
 
04:40:01.868 --> 04:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
25 mention that to give substantial
 
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
weight to and and
 
04:40:07.550 --> 04:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
if if I may it sounds like you support
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
the way that that's worded I support it
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
because it would have been a massive
 
04:40:14.070 --> 04:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
improvement over deciding that my
 
04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
8-year-old was a mature or minor and
 
04:40:18.750 --> 04:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
because she liked her California
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
vacations at Disneyland that California
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
C would be a good place to
 
04:40:27.470 --> 04:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
move follow up so M
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
Mike I feel for you yeah and I think
 
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's a better way that we can deal
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
with this and deal with your situation
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
but I I don't think the language is the
 
04:40:37.788 --> 04:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
way that it should be done because what
 
04:40:40.030 --> 04:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
it's saying and you are you are exactly
 
04:40:42.990 --> 04:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
right you saying that your 14-year-old
 
04:40:45.070 --> 04:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
swayed by Mom's opinion
 
04:40:47.230 --> 04:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old yeah in in this case
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
saying that you're 14-year-old I
 
04:40:51.230 --> 04:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
understand eight but your 14 a
 
04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
14-year-old in this situation comes
 
04:40:56.310 --> 04:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
forward and is swayed by Mom's
 
04:40:58.990 --> 04:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
persuasion that they want to move that
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
the judge can still make consideration
 
04:41:06.270 --> 04:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
to that person's persuasion so that's I
 
04:41:08.788 --> 04:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
I want so do you understand where I'm
 
04:41:11.550 --> 04:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
coming from yes and in fact I completely
 
04:41:16.270 --> 04:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
agree with you sir and so we may have a
 
04:41:17.990 --> 04:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
issue of how best to accomplish what
 
04:41:19.948 --> 04:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish and I think
 
04:41:23.150 --> 04:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
we're in agreement there
 
04:41:26.430 --> 04:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
and uh so if there are suggestions for
 
04:41:29.230 --> 04:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
amendments to do an even better job of
 
04:41:31.990 --> 04:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
this then I would certainly support that
 
04:41:33.310 --> 04:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and I was just going to ask
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%

Angela loer I am a resident and a
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
business owner in Conquer New
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am the mother of one
 
04:44:09.788 --> 04:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
daughter Stella who will actually be 13
 
04:44:12.868 --> 04:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I have been the main
 
04:44:18.190 --> 04:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:18.200 --> 04:44:21.948 align:start position:0%
 
2010

04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
um when the relationship between her
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
father and I dissolved our daughter was
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
just a year old when I decided the
 
04:44:31.390 --> 04:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
relationship was too toxic due to his
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
excessive drinking and emotional abuse
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
this wasn't an easy decision being a new
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
mom and still nursing at the time I knew
 
04:44:43.868 --> 04:44:43.878 align:start position:0%
I it would involve sharing time between
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
households and not being there daily as
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.788 --> 04:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
knew I knew it wasn't going to be easy
 
04:44:56.190 --> 04:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
but it was important to me that our
 
04:44:57.948 --> 04:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
daughter would grow up seeing two people
 
04:45:01.110 --> 04:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
love and respect each other despite the
 
04:45:04.510 --> 04:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
differences we had I knew how how
 
04:45:06.830 --> 04:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
important it is that both parents share
 
04:45:10.150 --> 04:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:12.390 --> 04:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we had shared parental
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
rights and a scheduled that worked every
 
04:45:15.440 --> 04:45:16.270 align:start position:0%
rights and a scheduled that worked every
few

04:45:16.270 --> 04:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
few
 
04:45:18.868 --> 04:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
years I would have to engage in Family
 
04:45:18.878 --> 04:45:20.110 align:start position:0%
years I would have to engage in Family
Court

04:45:20.110 --> 04:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
Court
 
04:45:22.430 --> 04:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
proceedings as my ex would bring me back
 
04:45:25.230 --> 04:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
to court again for full
 
04:45:27.550 --> 04:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
custody her father has always said
 
04:45:29.310 --> 04:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
through the years he would take her away
 
04:45:29.320 --> 04:45:30.190 align:start position:0%
through the years he would take her away
from

04:45:30.190 --> 04:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:45:34.470 --> 04:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
me despite her father having three DUI I
 
04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
always supported always supported a
 
04:45:39.628 --> 04:45:39.638 align:start position:0%
parenting plan that was
 
04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
fair just most recently in November
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
2019 my ex again engaged with a family
 
04:45:50.670 --> 04:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
court to revisit the parenting plan he
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
continued to motion the court for G
 
04:45:56.550 --> 04:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
Catherine stanburg which
 
04:45:59.948 --> 04:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
was um which was unclear as there has
 
04:46:03.150 --> 04:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
never been any allegation of abuse or
 
04:46:05.470 --> 04:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
any neglect in my
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
care my daughter's father also motioned
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
the court for an in camera interview
 
04:46:16.510 --> 04:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:18.910 --> 04:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
daughter the judge asked why he was
 
04:46:20.230 --> 04:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
motioning the
 
04:46:22.830 --> 04:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
court if neither one of us had been in
 
04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
the Family Court since
 
04:46:29.310 --> 04:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
2012 father replied my daughter wants to
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
live with me the marital Master replied
 
04:46:35.190 --> 04:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
no 10-year-old should be in the middle
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
let her be a
 
04:46:39.868 --> 04:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
kid after several requests the court
 
04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
ordered a
 
04:46:45.948 --> 04:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
gal only after manipulating my
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
daughter and saying things to the
 
04:46:51.310 --> 04:46:51.320 align:start position:0%

in the best interest of our
 
04:47:10.110 --> 04:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
daughter recommendations were made by
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
the guardian at lium which removed my
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
daughter from my care and consequently
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%

04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
although relationships and marriages
 
04:48:10.990 --> 04:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes do not work out this should
 
04:48:12.990 --> 04:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
not be a reason to obstruct one parent
 
04:48:14.708 --> 04:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
from being anything less than an equal
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the lives of our child
 
04:48:20.270 --> 04:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
children children have the right to love
 
04:48:23.548 --> 04:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
and be loved by both parents I know for
 
04:48:26.708 --> 04:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
me the most rewarding and fulfilling
 
04:48:29.990 --> 04:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
role in my life is that of a
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
mother I'm supporting I support HP
 
04:48:37.230 --> 04:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
1982 I believe shareed parenting with
 
04:48:39.510 --> 04:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
fit willing enabl parents is the best
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
outcome for children unless there is
 
04:48:44.030 --> 04:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
convincing supporting evidence that
 
04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
raises concerns related to criminal
 
04:48:51.230 --> 04:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
activity such as drug abuse domestic
 
04:48:54.548 --> 04:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
violence um and child abuse that would
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
adversely affect the well-being of a
 
04:48:58.990 --> 04:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
child I thank you for listening and I
 
04:49:02.150 --> 04:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
truly hope you support HB
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
1382 um after hear in more
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:49:10.750 --> 04:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill um my daughter was 10 years old
 
04:49:13.868 --> 04:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
like I said when we started and it it's
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
been half of her life he's taken me
 
04:49:15.600 --> 04:49:16.708 align:start position:0%
been half of her life he's taken me
three

04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:49:16.718 --> 04:49:18.390 align:start position:0%
three
times

04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
times
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
um she was 10 and he was like let her be
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
a kid um I had a guardian at lion that
 
04:49:30.350 --> 04:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
sided with Dad that paid her and um
 
04:49:32.110 --> 04:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
believed a lot of lies without no
 
04:49:34.948 --> 04:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
evidence I have no criminal background
 
04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
I've never had DCF called on me until he
 
04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't getting his way in court of
 
04:49:45.430 --> 04:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
course we were in Co a mother going
 
04:49:48.350 --> 04:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
through the stress that she was knowing
 
04:49:50.030 --> 04:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
that my daughter wanted more time with
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
her dad I gave
 
04:49:55.708 --> 04:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
5050 without a court order and to have
 
04:49:58.230 --> 04:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
somebody like Kathleen come in and say
 
04:49:59.868 --> 04:49:59.878 align:start position:0%
my kid was in
 
04:50:02.670 --> 04:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
danger five weeks before my final
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
hearing a just signed off on it did she
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
write that in the
 
04:50:09.470 --> 04:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation and are you sure it was
 
04:50:11.670 --> 04:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
2019 I thought we we did that bill
 
04:50:13.270 --> 04:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
earlier because I'll tell you that bill
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
came about because of me because we had
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations from a g so I said we
 
04:50:21.548 --> 04:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
decided no more recommendations from
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
gal's and now that I'm hearing she's
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
writing this and excuse me I'm very
 
04:50:29.548 --> 04:50:29.558 align:start position:0%
angry I can never get back the damage
 
04:50:31.788 --> 04:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
that lady's done to my
 
04:50:34.350 --> 04:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
family to my relationship with my
 
04:50:36.430 --> 04:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
daughter that was 10 and at the end of
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
it at 12 years old she said she was
 
04:50:42.830 --> 04:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
mature to make a
 
04:50:46.510 --> 04:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
decision no 12-year-old girl that just
 
04:50:50.030 --> 04:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
started her period and can't even
 
04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
understand her own emotions can decide
 
04:50:57.788 --> 04:50:57.798 align:start position:0%
what's best for her even during court I
 
04:50:59.948 --> 04:50:59.958 align:start position:0%
pleaded and pleaded and of course
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
everything was WebEx nothing's in
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
person um it was a difficult time I
 
04:51:07.310 --> 04:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
think for a lot of families but to be
 
04:51:10.590 --> 04:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
under covid your work your
 
04:51:10.600 --> 04:51:12.670 align:start position:0%
under covid your work your
homeschooling

04:51:12.670 --> 04:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
homeschooling
 
04:51:14.708 --> 04:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:51:17.470 --> 04:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm hurt and I'll never probably and
 
04:51:21.670 --> 04:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
now I'm back into why I left my ex and
 
04:51:24.990 --> 04:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
now he holds the power card and Kathleen
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
gave him that in the courts I
 
04:51:31.390 --> 04:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
feel um just stamped it thinking I had
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
so much evidence that they didn't look
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
at and if they would have just stuck
 
04:51:38.670 --> 04:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
with a mom that was willing to give
 
04:51:40.670 --> 04:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
every weekend if there was a Monday
 
04:51:43.150 --> 04:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
holiday he could have it we live an hour
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
apart so it's not easy I every other
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
week in the summer every school vacation
 
04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
I never want to deny my daughter more
 
04:51:55.788 --> 04:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
time with the other parent ever and then
 
04:51:57.910 --> 04:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
to go from being that parent through the
 
04:52:00.750 --> 04:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
young years and now and every other
 
04:52:04.590 --> 04:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
weekend mom is a sentence I would rather
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
be a
 
04:52:09.230 --> 04:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
criminal and get whatever they give me
 
04:52:13.510 --> 04:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
but not to be a part of my kid's life is
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
the worst feeling when I got that
 
04:52:17.548 --> 04:52:17.558 align:start position:0%
recommendation Kathleen made that said
 
04:52:19.150 --> 04:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
my kid was in
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
danger I felt to the ground like my kid
 
04:52:23.628 --> 04:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
I somebody came to my door and told me
 
04:52:26.948 --> 04:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
she was kidnapped and who was the judge
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:34.350 --> 04:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
Cooper I just feel like to see a copy of
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
04:52:38.190 --> 04:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation ordered all my
 
04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
transcripts and
 
04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
audio I did she ever provide you with a
 
04:52:45.070 --> 04:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
copy you should have been provided a
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
copy of what she gave to the court
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
anyways she should have provided both
 
04:52:52.230 --> 04:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
parties um I didn't get her final bill
 
04:52:54.750 --> 04:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
till months after when my my ex paid not
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
her bill I'm talking about the
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation that she made to the
 
04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.558 --> 04:53:04.628 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:53:04.628 --> 04:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:07.270 --> 04:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
that I guess is my story so for as a mom
 
04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
that gave it her all and he climbed the
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know the ladder in his career and he
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
did he manipulated my daughter because
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
he wasn't being heard and then he used
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
my daughter to say you need to tell the
 
04:53:22.750 --> 04:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
school this tell them that tell them
 
04:53:25.670 --> 04:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
that I never had DCF at my house I never
 
04:53:30.788 --> 04:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
had cops at my house I was abused too
 
04:53:33.628 --> 04:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
and I don't testify good as you can tell
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
tell this is very intimidating for me um
 
04:53:38.708 --> 04:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
because it reminds me of a it's very
 
04:53:41.948 --> 04:53:41.958 align:start position:0%
emotional and I understand yeah I
 
04:53:46.110 --> 04:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
understand I I understand Court PTSD it
 
04:53:49.230 --> 04:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
it's um I'm still healing and you know
 
04:53:52.750 --> 04:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
to to support this takes a lot because I
 
04:53:54.548 --> 04:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
want to put my head in the in in the
 
04:53:57.788 --> 04:53:57.798 align:start position:0%
sand but I if my situation doesn't
 
04:54:01.230 --> 04:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
change of course I'm devastated I don't
 
04:54:03.548 --> 04:54:03.558 align:start position:0%
want another family to go through
 
04:54:08.470 --> 04:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
through this and I feel like if it
 
04:54:11.548 --> 04:54:11.558 align:start position:0%
wasn't a battle like half of my
 
04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
daughter's life has been spend in court
 
04:54:17.070 --> 04:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
or the parents and then it's like every
 
04:54:20.670 --> 04:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
few years we made six and a half years I
 
04:54:23.350 --> 04:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
I mean to ask my kid to get in a court
 
04:54:26.670 --> 04:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
