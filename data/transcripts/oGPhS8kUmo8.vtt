with me on legislative and policy uh
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
stuff and we appreciate you having us
 
00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
here I've done uh uh have some handouts
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
at your places and prepared to give sort
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
of a short overview of past
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
Appropriations from the general fund um
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
understand that's what we're here for is
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
that yeah yes I I I'd like to learn more
 
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
about your
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
organization um you know what you do and
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh what happens if things go wrong right
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
I mean who loses if if a loan doesn't
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
work or something like that yeah that's
 
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
a very uh insightful question because I
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
kind of get think it gets at the um
 
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
origin story of why New Hampshire
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
housing even exists and why there are
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
other Housing Finance agencies and other
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
states that have a similar sort of
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
corporate structure where we are created
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
by state law and in some cases run
 
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
programs that are government like but we
 
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
are not a state agency we're not state
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
employees and and crucially our debt is
 
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 align:start position:0%
not the state's debt um and so uh so
 
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.670 align:start position:0%
not the state's debt um and so uh so
that

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh sorry sort of trying to think about
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
how to wrap that into my uh my robotic
 
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
pre-recorded Spiel that I was about to
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh give you um so so that that sort of
 
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:17.879 align:start position:0%
explains uh how we exist as an
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
organization uh just by way of further
 
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
introduction uh we are uh governed by a
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
board of directors that's appointed by
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
the governor and approved by the
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
executive Council the uh govern Governor
 
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
appoints the board chair every year um
 
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
and they approve the project financing
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
that we do and we Finance uh multif
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
family affordable rental housing
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
projects through a number of means and
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
that includes both sort of federal and
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
state resources and very often as you'll
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
see from these handouts a combination of
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
federal and state resources a lot of the
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
federal resources that are created in
 
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
the uh primarily actually the federal
 
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
tax code as opposed to sort of Hud
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are designed to not fund
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
the total cost of an affordable housing
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
project they're called sometimes the 30%
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
and the 70% tax credit which refers to
 
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of the project budget that
 
00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
the federal credits will pay for and so
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
um we use money like the state
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
affordable housing trust fund to uh it's
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
called Gap financing in the sort of
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
parlan of the industry um to fund the
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
Gap and make these projects um
 
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.309 align:start position:0%
Gap and make these projects um
financially

00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
financially
 
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
feasible um the the handouts that are in
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
front of you include sort of a a glossy
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
thing that talks about the affordable
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
housing fund and has some pictures of
 
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
some of the projects that we financed
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
recently inside the that handout there's
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
some fact sheets um that that Jack and
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
some of our other colleagues put
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
together that detail past Appropriations
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
to the affordable housing fund um that
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
first fact sheet has the number of
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
projects and housing units uh completed
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
and under construction uh the next next
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
page is a list of projects financed in
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
The Last 5 Years and then less
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
significant in terms of the amount of
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
money appropriated but also very
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
important the the state has legislature
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
has chosen to put money into the uh lead
 
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
paint Hazard remediation fund which we
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
administer and work closely with DHHS on
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
this we also administer a federal HUD
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
Grant to help low and moderate income uh
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners and uh landlords who are who
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
are renting to
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh families in those income brackets uh
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
address lead Hazard uh particularly in
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
in homes where there's been a child who
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
has been exposed to lead poisoning um
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
and you can see from that fact sheet
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
that uh we've used that is actually over
 
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
the last six years that the state has
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
put $6 million into that fund I believe
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
that was the first appropriation ever in
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
2019 um and that we've we've helped to
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
clear over 500 units the state money
 
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
there has been really critical for um
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
you know this can be really expensive
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
work you know $50,000 or something to
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
clear a a single family home of lead
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
hazards and a lot of our housing stock
 
00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:16.519 align:start position:0%
is pretty old um and there are families
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
that are above the um federal income
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
limits for the lead grant program uh but
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
there's still no way on Earth that
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to come up with
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
$50,000 to uh completely remediate their
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
home and and eliminate the lead hazards
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
that have poisoned their child and so
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
the state the state funds have been
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
really critical and although it's not
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
General funds and so we didn't included
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
I should mention there was another
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars in arpa money that went
 
00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
into that State uh lead Hazard
 
00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:44.030 align:start position:0%
into that State uh lead Hazard
remediation

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
remediation
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
fund um if I could jump back to the AHF
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
for just a minute and and we're happy to
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
take questions or or discuss I mentioned
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
that the uh affordable housing trust
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
fund is used as Gap filler for projects
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
that are financed with tax exemp bonds
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
generally and low-income housing tax
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
credits both of which are federal
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
programs I think it's important to note
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
and you can sort of see it from the the
 
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839 align:start position:0%
uh sort of uh highlight box on the first
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
on the front page of that glossy that
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
that generally results in leveraging of
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
you know something like 2:1 to 10:1 and
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
and averaging about 4:1 in terms of uh
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
Federal and private investment dollars
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
that uh pay for a Project's construction
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
when you spend $1 of affordable housing
 
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.069 align:start position:0%
when you spend $1 of affordable housing
fund

00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
money and uh the state gets an
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
allocation of tax credits and bond uh
 
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
capacity from the federal government
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
each year uh per the tax code which is
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
divided between the business financing
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
Authority and New Hampshire Housing
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority by state law um those
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
are those are General resources that
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
would go unspent if we didn't have uh
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
the resource uh at the state level to
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
sort of make the projects pencil out and
 
00:11:58.829 --> 00:11:58.839 align:start position:0%
so I think um it's been it's been a key
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
intervention mention to help with the
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
housing crisis that in these past few
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
budgets the state has elected to make
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
historic Appropriations to the
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund these uh the
 
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
numbers that you see you know the $30
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
million in the past two banial
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
budgets in addition to the uh creation
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
of the annual set aside of $5 million
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
for the real estate transfer tax is uh
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
is not the norm historically the fund
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
was created in 1983 I think by state law
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
and for the first uh you know 35 years
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
of its existence received only uh you
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
know sort of occasional appropriations
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
of a million or2 million dollars and
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
then things really changed when I think
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis came into sharper
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
Focus for a lot of folks uh about five
 
00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
Focus for a lot of folks uh about five
years

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
ago um one other thing I would just note
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
about the uh the fund itself we don't
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
take admin off the fund uh we are
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
allowed by state law to take a
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
percentage of the interest that is
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
earned on the affordable housing fund
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
that is in the trust fund in other words
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know usually that's money that's
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
been uh we commit it pretty quickly to
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
projects as soon as it's in there but
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes a while for them to
 
00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
start construction and then draw the
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
money down and so um so I think that's
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh to be conest a a pretty good deal for
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
the state because we're not uh we're not
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
really paying for our staff or paying to
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
keep our lights on and we don't receive
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
any operating funds we don't put in a
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
budget request to sort of pay our um
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
overhead uh essentially we're we're
 
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
doing that with um administrative fees
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
that were pulling off the federal
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
programs or um or in some cases a small
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
spread that were taking on the loans uh
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
which is limited by by federal law um
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
but it's it's very little in terms of
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
money that we actually draw from the
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
administration of the affordable housing
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
fund the state lead fund is a little bit
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
different we draw up to 5% uh of the
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation for admin we haven't added
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
any positions it's just essentially to
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
help pay for the time of the staff who
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
are charged with the administration of
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
that program and that is a more labor
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
intensive program to administer it's one
 
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:08.759 align:start position:0%
thing to fund a you know $6 million uh
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
rental housing uh project where there's
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of professionals involved and it's
 
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
generally very well-run doing a whole
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
bunch of small 20
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
$30,000 uh lead Hazard abatement
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
programs where it's occupied where there
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
somebody living there and you got to
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
relocate them is is um it's messy work
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
you know as anybody can attest to
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
they've tried to uh have worked done in
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
their homes so um so that explains that
 
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
um but but one of the specific questions
 
00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:38.839 align:start position:0%
we were asked to address was whether we
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
had added positions as a result of uh
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
these Appropriations the answer is no we
 
00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:46.519 align:start position:0%
actually um without getting too much off
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
onto a tangent some of the uh changes to
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
our business model over the past couple
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
of years as a result of the change in
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
the interest rate environment have
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
caused us to reduce positions and so
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
we've had to do a lot of work on
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
efficiency and um and so we're a smaller
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
organization actually than we were uh a
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
year or two years ago um but but I would
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
say doing the same or more in terms of
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
output and uh and Housing
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%
Finance um I think that touches on all
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
the high points I wanted to mention just
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
one other thing that I I never want to
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
sort of Let It Be unsaid with respect to
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
the uh housing that we are financing
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people have uh stigma
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
or perceptions about what affordable
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
housing is and a lot of this based on
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
sort of the legacy of public housing
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
which for a lot of different reasons uh
 
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
is is sort of an unfortunate Legacy much
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
of it was sort of neglected and some
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
cases very poorly managed um the other
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
sort of significant characteristic of
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
public housing was that folks paid um a
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of their uh income as opposed
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
to a fixed rent and you know that um if
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
you believe that income taxes discourage
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
work then well that certainly
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
discourages work because it's an effect
 
00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
a very high marginal tax rate um that is
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
not generally true of the housing that
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
is financed with these tools TOS today
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh essentially it's we're providing
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
below Market Capital to for-profit and
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
nonprofit developers around the state in
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
exchange for their legal commitment to
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
serve people who are at these lower
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
moderate income levels and uh for rents
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
that they can afford which is calculated
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
as a third of their of the not of their
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
household income but of the median
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
income for people in that income band
 
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
and so you there is no disincentive to
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
maximize your income because your rent
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't go up um in in these projects
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
and I think that's an important uh
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
distinction uh okay so uh you don't have
 
00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 is that not available
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
or uh so fiscal year 25 would be another
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
5 million I'm sorry if we missed that
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
okay and you get that five million
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
automatically from the real estate
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
transfer tax that's
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
correct and
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
um so the lead paint fund does that get
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
money from the feds regularly or is this
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's still living on this six million it
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
had from
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
2022 uh I don't know if you could say
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
it's regular because it's not a uh it's
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
not a sort of an appropriation that's
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
annually in the HUD budget or anything
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
like that the the way HUD does this and
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of call for some
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
change as they will sort of periodically
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
and somewhat unpredictably issue an RFP
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
and then states can apply and so we we
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
just kind of hope that those come around
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
before we run out of money and so um we
 
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
got a new Grant last year for can't
 
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
exactly remember 7.75 million okay um so
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
so yes it is funded by the feds not on
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
sort of a a consistent schedule in the
 
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
way that like the stuff that's in the
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
tax code is funded um but but we use the
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
state and the um and the federal funds
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
together okay and one last thing so um
 
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund it's really
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
grants right more than loans or is it
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
both it's both and I think uh so
 
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's almost it is always a loan uh
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
but it's generally a loan that is uh at
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
0% interest with uh the principal fully
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
deferred for the 30 just usually a
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
30-year term and then uh payments are
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
only due if the project is generating
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
cash flow and if it is then
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
the owner gets to take half and half
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
goes back into the affordable housing
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
fund um we use loans instead of Grants
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
just because it provides us with a
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism an enforcement mechanism
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
basically if if they are not fulfilling
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
the obligations under the regulatory
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
agreements the commitments they made to
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
serve low and modern income people or
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
whatever uh then we could foreclose on
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
them and that's sort of an easier legal
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
path to getting them to comply than
 
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
suing them so how much loan payments do
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
you get annually
 
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.630 align:start position:0%
you get annually
roughly

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh not a ton I it's probably and and
 
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
that's partly the result of the
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
relatively modest Appropriations that
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
were made over past years so I could get
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
you that answer I think it's um under a
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
million yeah it might be one or two
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
million okay and those just add to the
 
00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
fund for more exactly they go straight
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
into the affordable housing
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative Ms has a question thank
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank thank you uh
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
for coming in I I think you and I had
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
some interactions when I was with one
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
Scot you nice to see you um I I just a
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
couple questions um so what is what is
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
the total amount of general fund
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
allocations that you receive is it is it
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
an is it an excess of the amount that
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
you're showing here are there other uh
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
monies that you're getting in the
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
general fund no from the general fund so
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
the total that you're getting from the
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
general fund in FY 24 was $33 million
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh yeah is that the sum of
 
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
the4 yes okay and then um you had
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you were a small
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
organization how small how many
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
positions do you have well smaller I
 
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean we've we're about 130
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
between 130 and 135 okay down from and
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
so the result of that uh you know I
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh we had some positions we were up to
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
about 145 uh a couple of those were
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
running covid programs those programs
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
ended and those positions went away but
 
00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
as I said we've also had to find some
 
00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and reduce our cost
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
structure in some ways just in order to
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
um uh remain healthy and and stable okay
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
and those are all none of those are
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
state employees that's right that's
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
right we're n we don't we're not state
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
employees at New Hampshire housing okay
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
last question so um so what are your
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
um it's always sort of a uh the total
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
revenues number is going to sound really
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
high because it includes the uh Project
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
based or the the uh Section 8 or housing
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
Choice voucher program that we
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
administer for all the areas of the
 
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
like $300 million range I apologize that
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
I know okay probably looks kind of
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
stupid that I'm not answering that more
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
readily a lot of that is grant money in
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
and grant money out and those are that
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
is helping like poor people to pay their
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
rent essentially right um like as a
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
administrative entity our administrative
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
budget I could tell you more sort of
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
yeah that's proba that's probably what
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
I'm more interested in okay that's like
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh $22 million okay thank you y
 
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.430 align:start position:0%
uh $22 million okay thank you y
representative

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
Griffin yes thank you thank you for
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
um what is the typical rental of these
 
00:22:02.679 --> 00:22:04.750 align:start position:0%
um what is the typical rental of these
General

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
General
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
occupancy um units and do you have any
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
control over that do you have a way of
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh keeping a cap on that we do and the
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
the cap is the you know the contract
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
that the owner developer makes when we
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
Finance the property says for the life
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
of the affordability restriction which
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
is like 30 to 99 years depending on
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
which program they use can't be less
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
than 30 years in the affordable housing
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
fund um they agree that they're going to
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
rent it to people at these certain
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
income levels which is generally 60 or
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
80% of area median income in some cases
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's lower like 50 or 30 and then the
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
rent has to be set at a rate that is uh
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
affordable meaning somebody at that
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
income level would not be paying more
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
than 30% of their income on rent so if
 
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's you know the deepest affordable
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
units at 30% of area median income
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
depending on you know the of the state
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
and uh certain other factors including
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
whether the landlords paying the
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
utilities might be uh6 or $700 um at the
 
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:12.919 align:start position:0%
upper end I think you know a unit at 80%
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
of Ami in Hillsboro OR Rockingham County
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
um jump in if you have a a quicker
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
recall of these numbers I don't um but I
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
think you know you might have an
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
affordable unit that's at 1,800 uh9
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
00 I I might not get that precisely
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
right but I think the point is that
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like Market rent to a lot of us
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
but if you look at what Market rent
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
actually is now in you know Southern New
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's it's and the second part
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
of that question is um how do you how do
 
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
you control that how do you ensure that
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
the owners are doing that or do the
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
tenants do that yeah no we don't expect
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
the tenants to know all those rules and
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
and enforce them uh we have a compliance
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
and asset management team and they go
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
out and depending on the program they're
 
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
out at a property um e either every year
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
or every three years and I think we take
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of pride in that because it's not
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
only I mean they're checking files so
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
they'll they won't say in advance but
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
they'll say you know give me you know
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
these six units maybe it's a tenth of
 
00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.559 align:start position:0%
the units or something and they'll make
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
sure that the residents they've rented
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
to were income qualified and they'll
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
make sure they're not charging them any
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
more rent than they're allowed to charge
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
and there are serious consequences if
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
they violate their investors could lose
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
tax credits there are serious Financial
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
viol uh uh um consequences for the
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
owners and managers we also make sure
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
that it's like professionally well-kept
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
and a nice place to live and that's you
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
know getting back to that sort of legacy
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
of public housing thing people who live
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
in affordable housing don't have always
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
have a ton of choices and so there is
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
not always the same incentive that there
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
is in market rate housing for the
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
landlord to keep it attractive and so we
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
we work together with them and generally
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's a very collegial thing to make
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
that these are places that people are
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
proud to call home thank representative
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
rang and then representative Ms thank
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
I have three questions one um regarding
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
the lead paint program you said the
 
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
grant it says Grant assistance up to
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
$177,000 per unit what's the median and
 
00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
the average cost of remediation like how
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
much does that 177,000
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
cover when you average median and
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
average cost of remediation I don't have
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
those numbers off the top of my head we
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
can get them uh I think the uh
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
especially recently it would be pretty
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
close to that maximum um just because
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
construction cost and particularly uh
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
sort of the cost of labor for and this
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
is labor intensive work has has gone up
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
quite a bit so I think we've seen the
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
cost of our projects increase quite a
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
bit in the last you know four or five
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
years yeah I was just wondering how much
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
does that actually cover the 17,000 um
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
and then uh you mentioned that you got a
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
7.75 million doll grant for that program
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
did that come from the federal
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
government yes okay and then my last
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
um this program responds to when a child
 
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
has been um diagnosed with lead
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
poisoning but is there any part of this
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
program that is preventative because
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
once a child tests positive they've
 
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
already gotten some brain damage it may
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
not be explicit for years but they
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
they've lost IQ points so is there any
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity for landlords to participate
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
in this program prior to a child being
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosed just if the if the paint does
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
test positive for lead yes there is
 
00:26:42.389 --> 00:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
there is I mean it's um it's a higher
 
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
priority if there's already a child
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
who's if the unit is under order as we
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
say as a child is tested positive but if
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's a unit where there's uh test
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
positive uh for lead hazards and there
 
00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:57.559 align:start position:0%
are children in the unit but they're not
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
poisoned yet that's that's absolutely an
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
eligible project I mean we want to do
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
those and and we would like to do more
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
of them it's just an even higher
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
priority if there is uh you know a child
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
who's exposed to those hazards now I
 
00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:11.559 align:start position:0%
think what you know the the reason this
 
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
program probably exists and and I don't
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
think uh is because uh the alternative
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
very often is that folks lose their
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
housing and it's sort of a terrible
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
choice for a family to be faced with to
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
either continue to expose their child to
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
lead hazards or or move and they might
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
not be able to afford someplace else
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you actually I I
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
have one um one thing I wanted to add
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative run um the maximum for
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
the Federal grant program is 177,000 per
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
unit but it is typically coupled with
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
the state Loan program and you can get a
 
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
loan up to 100,000 per
 
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
unit right representative Ms then evil
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
then camell sorry couple just two more
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
questions um the the lead paint Hazard
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh remediation fund is there any all
 
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
general fund allocation for f 24 and
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
25 no uh we did get that $1 million in
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
arpa funds U okay but no uh nothing else
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes pres bble thank you
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I've got I've I just got a
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
couple of questions
 
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
um could you talk a little bit about the
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
challenges that you face in deployment
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
of the funds for investment in
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
affordable housing I mean and and is the
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
money pretty much gone
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
or and I I might have a couple followups
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
on that I mean because we've invested a
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
lot of money in it and it's interesting
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
to hear how it's how it's working on the
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
in the field sure thank you for the
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
question I think it's working very well
 
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
I mean I think the and the list of
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
projects and properties that you see in
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
in the handouts will attest to the fact
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
that it's it's making a difference and
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
one thing we didn't include for you know
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to sort of make it too
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
busy of a chart but we didn't include
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
all the other funds that are leveraging
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
leveraged there but I think the number
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
of when you look at the efficiency of
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
that resource and the number of homes
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
that are being created all over the
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
state um it is working uh the money is
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much fully committed which is not
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
the same as saying it's all spent like I
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
said it sometimes takes time for these
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
projects to get uh sort of completely
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
underway and and maybe that gets to your
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
obstacles question um I should mention
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
there was another handout that I didn't
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
get we didn't get slipped into the
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
folder but you each have which is the uh
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
I think it's four projects that we can't
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
say with 100% certainty that um these
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
are the four that we would fund if there
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
was an additional appropriation to the
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund but we just
 
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you an idea um these are
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
projects that are um I think fully
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
permitted uh you know they've done their
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
estimates they've done their engineering
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
and things like that and they have
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
applied for financing and and they were
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
we found them to be eligible but not you
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
know we couldn't fund them because we
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources right now um
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
obstacles certainly the local permitting
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
process is the most significant I think
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
any developer home builder would tell
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
you that the uncertainty and delays and
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
cost associated with the uh High degree
 
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
of variability and sort of um the
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
subjective nature of some of that uh of
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
how that those local permitting
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
processes are administered can be very
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
challenging um State Perman is an issue
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
too and it's encouraging to see that
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of momentum for reform in
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
that respect so that folks can get their
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain permits which are
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
a typical requirement for larger project
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
projects and uh driveway permits more
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
quickly um and more generally I think
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
the the same headwinds that face kind of
 
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
all aspects of construction are are
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
certainly true for for affordable
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
housing as well labor costs are up
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
material costs are up um and uh and
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
contractors very busy I was I used to be
 
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
a general contractor worked for North
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
Branch here in conquered for uh you know
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
5 years during the sort of Great
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
Recession uh which doesn't say a lot for
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
my judgment but it was a a time when a
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
lot of contractors were leaving the
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
business and uh a lot of a lot of them
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
you know have either sort of retired or
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
or just like there hasn't been that next
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
generation of contractors so that's
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
another thing where there's a lot of
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
good momentum around you know building
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
the trades but it's we got a long way to
 
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.669 align:start position:0%
the trades but it's we got a long way to
go

00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
got a couple so one of the things that
 
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing about is that
 
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities are very willing to have
 
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
these housing projects come into their
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
um communities and actually permitting
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
isn't a huge problem the problem pure
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
and simple is uh available
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure water sewer sometimes
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
there are traffic concerns and um you
 
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
know some community ities they just flat
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
out don't have the Municipal Water
 
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
Supplies uh have you run and my
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that these housing
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
funds can't be used by municipalities
 
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure improvements to
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
support better
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
housing could you comment on my
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
prattling oh uh thank you for the
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
question it's not I not prattling at all
 
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
I think um it's a very good question and
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
it is something you hear a lot I would
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
say that there is um you know there
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
there is some truth to that I wouldn't
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
say it's the whole story we do have
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
where where permitting allows for it
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
there are projects that are um not on uh
 
00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:46.039 align:start position:0%
water and sewer you know particularly
 
00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
you know you'll see some 12 24 unit
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
we've got a I think it's a 72 unit uh
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
property in Hampton Falls that's on
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
community Wells it can be done and so
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
the idea that it's just sort of like you
 
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
know there's just nothing we can do
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately until we have money for
 
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
water and sewer is certainly not um not
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
accurate but it's it's true that that
 
00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
more water and sewer would facilitate
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
more construction of of every type it
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
certainly it is true that municipalities
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
uh municipalities or counties could
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
apply for affordable housing fund to
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
build affordable housing they couldn't
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
do it they couldn't do it to sort of put
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
in new sewer lines um but there is uh uh
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
our friends at business and economic
 
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
Affairs have the new program with
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
housing Champions uh and I think they
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
are just rolling out the first grant
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity for housing Champion
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
communities where they can apply for
 
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
money that's I think uh sort of
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
specifically intended for things like
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and I think that that
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
that marriage between the housing
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
Champions program and that grant program
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
is makes a ton of sense because if a
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
community is going to get money from the
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
state to put in sewer lines or uh you
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
know water
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it I think it it makes
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
sense from the state's perspective uh to
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're using that
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
investment to the to the greatest good
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know creating new homes
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
for the residents of New Hampshire you
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to put $5 million into
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's Water and Sewer so they could
 
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
build you know 11 single family homes
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
there okay just one more well uh there's
 
00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.079 align:start position:0%
the interesting situation in my area
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
where the uh Municipal Water Supply has
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
been unable to provide water and they've
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
discovered that the groundwater is
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
polluted and so they can't have
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
Community Wells either um from yeah it's
 
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
not great anyway um it just points out
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
the problem that you can fix many laws
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
but you can't fix some of those
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
structural issues um on the lead
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
remediation do you have any sense of how
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
much progress we're making on
 
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
remediating the lead challenges in the
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no I'm sorry I don't but I I
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
could ask around at the office and there
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
may be some policy folks who have a
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
better sense of sort of overall
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
household stock age of the inventory how
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
many we've done and where sort of where
 
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
we are at in our uh yeah that's a good
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
question all right you might be
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
interested in the bill I have in
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
resources later today that addresses
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
some of that maybe uh representative
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
cells thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
for taking the question along the lines
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
of what representative eel asked um I
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
lead paint has been banned for decades
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
now so I'm wondering what what's the
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
Frequency that you guys run into
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
situations with the lead paint where you
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
actually find it and um do you actually
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
spend all of the funds every year and if
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
not do you can you accumulate the funds
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
or use them for other aspects of the
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
program well we certainly uh there's
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
there is still a lot of lead paint out
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
there and so while I don't have uh
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
numbers on there we you know we're not
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
going out looking for projects we are uh
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
getting referrals sometimes from DHHS
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
because they have a program and so if a
 
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
doctor's office you know identifies a
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
family where a child has been poisoned
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
you know they'll call up either us or
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
there's a few you know Sol County
 
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
Claremont and NASA and Manchester have
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
their own programs and so we'll work
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
together with them to make sure that we
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
can pull the money together to help uh
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
eliminate that Hazard um is all the
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
money spent every year is the question
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
and I think uh we don't get money every
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
year and so we're we try to sort of um I
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
mean we put it out to eligible projects
 
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
as quickly as we can but it's not it's
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
not like it's gone in a year um it it is
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
certainly only used for this purpose
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
like we would never take lead money that
 
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
the state has appropriated and use it
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
for any other purpose um other than
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
helping to eliminate lead hazards and
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
and as I said the 5% that were allowed
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
administration and so do you have a so
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
you roll it over and what would the
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
current balance
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
be uh you know that's a good question I
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
thought we had it in here I believe it's
 
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.030 align:start position:0%
thought we had it in here I believe it's
around

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
$300,000 in state Le funds but that
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
might been before we got that million in
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
arpa so I can I can definitely follow up
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
information yes thank you do you do you
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
have an annual report that has like a
 
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
balance sheet and an income
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
statement um we have audited financials
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
that I can share our annual report which
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
I can give you is not is more of like a
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
glossy type thing yeah yeah right but I
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
can I can share our audit Financial the
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
a yeah that' be good um have you had a
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
performance audit anytime recently
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh we have a financial audit which
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
includes certain aspects of sort of
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
federal perform Federal program uh
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
compliance and performance we have a lot
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
of different uh oversight and monitoring
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
reviews under those Federal programs um
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess the answer is uh yes not
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily for our whole organization
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
but for certain aspects of it yeah not
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
by the LBA no no okay good any other
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative run thank you
 
00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.670 align:start position:0%
questions representative run thank you
Mr

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
chair um following up on representative
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
canvas's um comment of the lead
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
remediation uh projects that you have
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
how many come from lead paint and how
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
how many come from lead fixtures or
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
piping it's almost all lead paint it is
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
because uh the state does report I
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
forget I think it's every two or three
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
years um the uh concentrations of lead
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's found in any schools private
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
public schools Child Care Centers and
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
there are spikes every year and um we
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
had one in miramac several years ago and
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
it turned out to be from fixtures in the
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
school and that kind of because the we
 
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
have Municipal Water that's tested for
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
lead so we knew it wasn't the water
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
coming in um and we knew it wasn't lead
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
paint so I that was just an idea I had
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
from his comment is that there was other
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
sources of lead than lead paint and I
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to see what your experience was
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
right and one other question on um your
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
list of uh projects under the completed
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
projects you have some that um and I'll
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
just take Bridge Street recovery
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
transitional housing um it the type is
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
called acquisition rehab so is it adding
 
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
eight units or rehabbing eight units and
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
making them
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
habitable you know that term acquired
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
rehab what is that Encompass acquisition
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
and Rehab uh it can mean a couple
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
different things one is it's existing
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
housing and it's occupied and it's being
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
rehabbed and so like for example on the
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
orange up above the conquered roal
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
Gardens is a great big uh existing
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
affordable housing project on the
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
heights here in conquer that's very it
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
was in terrible condition had been
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
needing some attention for a long long
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
time and so we worked to refinance it it
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
got sold and we're we're helping the
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
owner new owners to make it a lot better
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
for the people who live there uh the one
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in uh
 
00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:28.839 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
Bennington uh that was an old Motel
 
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
abandoned motel that they bought and um
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
and rehabbed it to be recovery housing
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
and so um in that case there weren't
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
people living there um so so it varies I
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
guess the answer y all right we'll let
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative eel have the last
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
question okay it's just actually a
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
really quick one so um other than
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
referrals by uh a doctor or whatever to
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
the lead remediation program how do
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
people find the program do they have to
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
go to your website or what's the West
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
best way of people finding that um they
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
can find it through our website but they
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to go there I mean we do try
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of Outreach and so uh you
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
know we'll do events with the Community
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
Action agencies will get Flyers into
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
their offices we want people to be aware
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
of lead hazards as uh you said before
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
their kids are exposed to those hazards
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
or before they're poisoned um and and
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes we'll set up a table at
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh Community event or something like
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
that and and our partners in like I said
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
nsha Claremont and Manchester are doing
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things as well uh trying
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
to educate people once they're educated
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
they can reach out to us by phone or by
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
um uh through the website to learn more
 
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
about the program and see if they're
 
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
eligible yeah when did they stop using
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
lead paint I'm just curious 1978 is when
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
it was banned and so you know probably
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
some people had some stock on hand but
 
00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.670 align:start position:0%
some people had some stock on hand but
yeah

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you very much gentlemen
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
I'll look forward to reading your audit
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair all right so we had
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
scheduled the business Finance Authority
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
they were unable to make it so I guess
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to be rescheduled at some
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
point um so we have a free 20 minutes I
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
just wanted to comment um as you
 
00:42:17.319 --> 00:42:18.510 align:start position:0%
just wanted to comment um as you
probably

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
noticed I'm perfectly okay with not
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
going followup Mr chairman yes you may
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
follow up because you know we see people
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
that are mostly agencies and you when
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
you have a question you typically have a
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
a line of questions so as long as you're
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%

00:42:58.109 --> 00:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
full committee the full committee will
 
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:03.640 align:start position:0%

responsible for administering about 2.9
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
billion in revenue on the left hand

facility quality assessment okay and
 
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
that is a a tax on nursing facilities um
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
we collect it and turn it over to a
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that's administered um by
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
on slide 12 this is a piie that shows
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
all of the general and education trust
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
fund revenue and dr's statutory
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are in bold and so
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
you'll see that that equates to
 
01:09:44.829 --> 01:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
76.7% of the general and education trust
 
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
fund um flows through the Department of
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue um other areas that we don't
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
collect um include uh Lottery and liquor
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from those departments um
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
and they're responsible for collecting
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
overseeing on slide 13 um I wanted to
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
give an overview of our Revenue
 
01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
information management system this is
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
our backend technology system um Dr
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
received a
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
$3,160 th000 capital
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation um to replace our aging
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
Tims system or tax information
 
01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
management system Tims um was
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
implemented in 1990 it was an homegrown
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
cobal system um so think black
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
background green flashing cursor um I
 
01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
remember my first day at Dr I put my
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
hand on The Mouse and the person that
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
was training me was like oh you're not
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
going to need that uh a lot of function
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
keys a lot of tabbing no no need for a
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
mouse um it was um becoming obsolete and
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
limited in its functionality
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
um and we had concerns about the
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
reliability usefulness and security of
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
the system um so that was prompted us to
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
seek the capital appropriation to
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
upgrade to rims rims is used not only by
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
Dr staff but also by taxpayers and
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
practitioners it was implemented in
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
partnership with doit um and as I said
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
is a complete backend technology system
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
which is housing and consolidating all
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
of our taxpayer data so everything lives
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
within this
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
system fast Enterprises was selected
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
through an RFP process to implement the
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
system and support their commercial
 
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
off-the-shelf software called gen tax uh
 
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
gen tax is used in the majority of
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
States um it is a t a software specific
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
for tax
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
administration implementation consisted
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
of three phases each taking about a year
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
um and the initial contract also
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
included support and maintenance of the
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
system for 4 years after implementation
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
and the total cost for that contract
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
with fast was $
 
01:11:56.639 --> 01:11:59.270 align:start position:0%
with fast was $
29,5

01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
29,5
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
15,000 um on the last bullet here you'll
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
see that that 7-year contract it's very
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
hard to believe but that expires on 1231
 
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
2025 and so we expect to enter into one
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
of three optional three-year extensions
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
at the conclusion of this initial
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
contract so ongoing hardware and
 
01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
software maintenance will need to
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
transition into our operating budget
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
because the capital budget has run
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
out on page 14 this is just for
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
reference these are the three rollouts
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
for rims um I would note that their
 
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
project was on time and on budget
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
despite uh a bit of a global pandemic
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
occurring um in the middle of those
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
rollouts but everything went very
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
smoothly and everything was delivered on
 
01:12:48.629 --> 01:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
time and on
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
budget on page 15 this is a snapshot of
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
what's called Granite tax connect and
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
this is our online taxpayer portal um
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
something new that we have um with rims
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
the ability for taxpayers to take a lot
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
of various functions on their own
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
without having to interact uh directly
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
with the department they can make
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
payments payments they can file returns
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
they can uh register for a new
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
license um there's also links on here to
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
report tax fraud to submit an appeal
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
request and to look up a meals and
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
rentals tax license
 
01:13:27.149 --> 01:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
um so there's quite a bit of
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
functionality that taxpayers and
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
practitioners and just the general
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
public have at their fingertips through
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
connect on slide 16 so there is revenue
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
uplift associated with the
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of rims or the
 
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
legislature anticipated that we would
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
generate Revenue through this new modern
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
system and so the capital budget of
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
$3,160 th000
 
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
includes $6 million of general fund
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
bonds and
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
24.16 um that of 24.16 million of bonds
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
that are going to be um paid for by the
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
revenue uplift so the principal and
 
01:14:17.229 --> 01:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
interest on that 24.16 million will be
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
paid for by Revenue that's generated
 
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
from the system and so the way that we
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
do that is there um is a requirement
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
every year that we transfer up to $4
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
million of the revenue uplift that's
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
generated into a dedicated fund to pay
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
the principal and interest on those
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
bonds and we will make those payments
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
until um we've made a total of total
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
million on slide 17 we'll I'll show you
 
01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
the history of the payments that we've
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
made so in fiscal year 2020 we were not
 
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
fully implemented yet we didn't transfer
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
anything into the revenue new uplift
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
account in fiscal year 2021 we
 
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
transferred 2.2 million and then in 22
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
23 and 24 we have reached that $4
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
million cap so year uh from
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
implementation to date we have
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
transferred 14.2 million so we have 25.8
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
million to go in order to get to that
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
total of 40 million so if we deposit $4
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
million a year we'll be making transfers
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
for seven more
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
years at the bottom of the page this
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
shows the revenue uplift that was
 
01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
identified for fiscal year
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
2024 and so we did that through a
 
01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
variety of ways um rims allows us to
 
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
send out reminder to pay letters so we
 
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
send out a tax notice and then in 30
 
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
days if you haven't paid we send you a
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
nice reminder we found that folks really
 
01:15:50.189 --> 01:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate those reminders we're all
 
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
very busy we have a lot going on and the
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
reminder to pay typically generates a
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
payment prior to rims we would not reach
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
back out with a reminder we didn't have
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
an easy way to do that and so we would
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
send the tax notice and after the appeal
 
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
period laps you would be transferred to
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
collections and collections would
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
contact you so this friendly reminder
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
has generated revenue for us we're also
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
able to better use federal tax
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
information the IRS has pretty stringent
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
um rules and restrictions on security of
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
the information that they provide to the
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
states and our old um system Tims didn't
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
meet um all of the requirements and so
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to um fully utilize
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
federal tax information rims obviously
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
fully meets those requirements so we're
 
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
better able to use that information from
 
01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:42.550 align:start position:0%
better able to use that information from
the

01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
IRS and lastly um through rims we have
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
established automated payment plans so
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
if a taxpayer receives a tax notice and
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
they can't make that payment in one lump
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
sum they're able to go on to Granite tax
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
connect put in what they would like to
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
make for a payment plan and so far as it
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
meets um some general requirements that
 
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
we've set forward it's automatically
 
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
approved and initiated we don't even
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
need to review it um taxpayers can
 
01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
schedule the payments to be made to us
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
and so it relieves staff time for us
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
automated represent I didn't know if you
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
were leaving Rim so
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
I maybe you said this when is the Bond
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
paid off for the
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
rims investment so we will make payments
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
into the dedicated account until we
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
reach $40 million the responsibility of
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
issuing the bonds is with Treasury and
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
so they provide us with the debt service
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
schedule and so until we have um made
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
all of the payments of that full Capital
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation we won't have the full
 
01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
Debt Service so I don't have the exact
 
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
answer to that because the bonding
 
01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
schedule are kind of controlled by
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
treasury just um so um as far as
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
entering into a new contract for rims so
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if any of the
 
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
revenue uplift could be used to help
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
offset that cost but it sounds like it's
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to be used for the the way the
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
statute is currently the revenue uplift
 
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
is utilized um for The Debt
 
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
Service but at the bottom on on page 17
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
you can see that there're in fiscal year
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
for Revenue uplift from rims was almost
 
01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.110 align:start position:0%
for Revenue uplift from rims was almost
$14.5

01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
$14.5
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
million we had the C have the cap in
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
statute we're only 4 million can be
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
transferred I had a question so if uh
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
somebody has arranged a a payment
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
schedule what is the interest rate
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's being charged to them for the you
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
know late payments sure so the interest
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
rate is set in statute and it updates
 
01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
every year um we are usually two
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
percentage points ahead of the IRS
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
interest rate at a certain period of
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
time so we're usually looking at the IRS
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
interest rate in September we add two
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
points and that becomes the rate for the
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
next calendar year thank
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
you representative mons thank you Mr
 
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
chair so maybe I missed something the
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
the the on page 17 the 14.4 million that
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
is the is that the the the revenue up
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
the total revenue uplift for fiscal year
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
24 correct cor and only 4 million of
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
that was used towards the bonds correct
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
so following up on representative Evil's
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh question so there's 10 million that's
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
available that could be used for
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
something else other like operating
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
costs correct right now that money is
 
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
just in the general fund um but yes
 
01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:49.719 align:start position:0%
there was rims generated 10 million more
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
than was required for The Debt Service
 
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
transfer but that's just sitting in the
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
general fund for all general fund uses
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
um and and and um that 14 million is
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
that has that been a a stable number or
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
is that going up has that gone up over
 
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
time that has gone up over time um in a
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
few more slides we'll talk about this
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
again just to make sure we're thorough
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
but um for the three approximately three
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
years since
 
01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
implementation we have generated a total
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
revenue uplift of $3 31.1 million so
 
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
essentially in 3 years the system has
 
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
effectively paid for itself um but that
 
01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.790 align:start position:0%
effectively paid for itself um but that
14.4

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
14.4
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
million is the high actually I do have
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
this information with
 
01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:44.470 align:start position:0%
this information with
me

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
um so 14.4 million was the total in
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
24 in fiscal year 23
 
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.199 --> 01:21:32.030 align:start position:0%
 
2.3

01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
4.8

01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
4.8
 
01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.950 align:start position:0%
4.8
5.4

01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
5.4
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
million and then in fiscal year 21 it
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
was 2.2
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
million so it has been going up um every
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
year with the highest year being in
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure jumping ahead but do you have a
 
01:21:59.709 --> 01:21:59.719 align:start position:0%
sense of what it's going to cost for the
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh operating budget for the computer if
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
hold that question get we'll get there
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
and if I don't sufficiently cover it let
 
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.189 align:start position:0%
and if I don't sufficiently cover it let
me

01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
know okay on page
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
18 um just looking at the agency budget
 
01:22:19.149 --> 01:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
uh the efficiency
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
budget so the majority um of dr's
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue Approximately 80% is general
 
01:22:25.199 --> 01:22:26.030 align:start position:0%
Revenue Approximately 80% is general
fund

01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue we have about 1.5 million of
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue or um spend from uh the
 
01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and that's for the
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
low and moderate property tax relief
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
program that has been running somewhere
 
01:22:41.679 --> 01:22:42.910 align:start position:0%
program that has been running somewhere
between

01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
1.2 and 1.4 million over the past few
 
01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
years and then the agency income that
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
you see this is a combination of two
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
things the first is the Rim's Debt
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
Service so The Debt Service payments are
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
showing in our agency
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
income and then also included in agency
 
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
income are flood control payments so
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
these are payments to
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities that were
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
impacted um by the damning of the
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and the marac rivers when
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
that happened the rivers flooded the
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
dams are to the South the rivers flooded
 
01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
to the north and there were towns that
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
lost land to the now wider Rivers so
 
01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
there is a marac river valley flood
 
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
Compact and a Connecticut River Valley
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
flood compact um where municipalities
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
receive reimbursement for the land taxes
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
that were lost from those Rivers uh the
 
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
damning of those rivers and so that is
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
income represent is Massachusetts pain
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
it's where yes so there's a a history of
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
um some inconsistent
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
participation um on the part of the
 
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth and we've worked with the
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice um numerous times
 
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
to reach settlements with the
 
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth um we do currently have a
 
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
settlement for back payments from um
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and we are cautiously
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
optimistic that those payments will
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
continue into the future so we've talked
 
01:24:23.629 --> 01:24:23.639 align:start position:0%
about flood control extensively in Prior
 
01:24:23.639 --> 01:24:24.830 align:start position:0%
about flood control extensively in Prior
years

01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to talk about it
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
to the same extent this year and fingers
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
crossed that um the payments from the
 
01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.149 align:start position:0%
crossed that um the payments from the
Commonwealth

01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
continue um flipping representative Ms
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
has a question sorry it's it's cold this
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
morning and I don't think my brain's
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
working right
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
um so agency income it the the it
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
includes you said Debt Service and flood
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
control payments those are payments how
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
is that become income or where's the
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
income coming from correct so from um
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
the for the flood control it's going to
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
be payments from Connecticut and
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and also a transfer in for
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire the amount that New
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's responsible for and then for
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
income that is going to be from the rims
 
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
um Revenue uplift dedicated
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
fund the 4 million a year that goes into
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
that fund will use a port portion of
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
that whatever was necessary to make The
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
Debt Service payments for that
 
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
year so both non general fund
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
non-education trust fund Revenue sources
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
so The Debt Service payments are hitting
 
01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
your your account correct okay that was
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
a change that was made in the last
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
budget um in the 2425 budget previously
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
those payments were made by Treasury and
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't show in dr's budget but
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
there was a decision during the last
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
Dr but treasury needs to per we receive
 
01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
the amounts that need to be paid from
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
treasury but they sit in the payments
 
01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
budget okay moving on to page 19 so what
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
does the agency budget um look like so
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
our current funded position count is
 
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
reduced by 18
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
positions down to 135 full-time
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
classified and unclassified positions
 
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
and five part-time
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
positions um the unfunded positions
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
include nine tax Auditors five tax
 
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
examiners in our taxpayer services
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
division two administrators one paralal
 
01:26:42.189 --> 01:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
and one utility
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
appraiser all of the positions that are
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
proposed to be unfunded are currently
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
vacant and our general fund operating
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
budget is 70% salary and benefits so we
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
are a department of people and not
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
things or
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
programs the agency budget request fully
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
operationalized the Department's Rim
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
system as I mentioned the capital
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
expenses will end on 12
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
3125 and it also funds a conversion of
 
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
rims to a cloud-based platform so we
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
currently have um on premise Hardware
 
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
that runs rims um that Hardware is at
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
end of life and we have made the
 
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
decision to hopefully move to a
 
01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.590 align:start position:0%
decision to hopefully move to a
cloud-based

01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
platform um funding in the agency budget
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
includes um Rim support audit positions
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
um and assistance in the hearing Bureau
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
were included as prioritized
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
needs other reductions that we made to
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
our budget include outof State travel
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
training and
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
Equipment um we at the department did
 
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
work very hard on this agency budget we
 
01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
really understand um the revenue picture
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that we budget
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
conservatively and accurately requesting
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
funds for needs and not
 
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
wants to more thoroughly answer
 
01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
representative eel's question relative
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
to rims so the agency
 
01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.390 align:start position:0%
to rims so the agency
budget

01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
includes um software General software
 
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance which is $800,000 a
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
year it's going to include Hardware
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance of $750,000
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
a year and that's for the cloud-based
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
platform and then it also includes time
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
and materials for consultant
 
01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
support So in our current budget for
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 24 and 25 we have time and
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
materials um budgeted for six
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
Consultants that is reduced down to four
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
in um fiscal years 26 and
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
27 um so we will have four Consultants
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
from the vendor budgeted for um in 26
 
01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
and 27 the reason why we do um a time
 
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
and materials approach to that
 
01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:07.119 align:start position:0%
consultant support is really to make
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
sure that we are getting exactly what
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
we're paying for the vendor offers kind
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
of tiered levels of
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
support um where the cost is is higher
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
um but I wasn't comfortable necessarily
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
signing on to the those tiered levels of
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
support CU I didn't know exactly what we
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
needed so we opted for the time and
 
01:29:31.629 --> 01:29:31.639 align:start position:0%
materials we have been successful with
 
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
the six positions um and I'm comfortable
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
moving to four positions um going
 
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
forward in 26 and
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
27 so with all of that rims will be
 
01:29:45.149 --> 01:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
fully operationalized in our operating
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
cease on page 20 um just a few updates
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
on our budget priorities things that we
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to achieve in fiscal years 24 and
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
25 so relative to rims we did upgrade to
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
the latest version which is called core
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
21 and that went Live this past October
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
it has um enhanced security it has a
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
modern coding language so it should be
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
um easier to recruit uh people to uh
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
service the the technology and increased
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
efficiency and ease of use for taxpayers
 
01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.030 align:start position:0%
efficiency and ease of use for taxpayers
and

01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
practitioners also we've been very
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
focused on the revenue uplift which I
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
covered um the 14.5 million in fiscal
 
01:30:34.639 --> 01:30:36.229 align:start position:0%
covered um the 14.5 million in fiscal
year

01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
2024 and then also in our current budget
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
um we were able to upgrade our existing
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
Fleet so we have fleet cars for a number
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
of reasons we have collectors that are
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
out on the road we have Auditors out of
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
the road out on the road and our
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
property appraisal folks in the
 
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
municipal and property division are
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
regularly out on the road um we
 
01:30:59.709 --> 01:30:59.719 align:start position:0%
modernized our Fleet to include
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
all-wheel drive hybrid vehicles that
 
01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
will decrease um gas cost going forward
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
and decrease maintenance costs going
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
into the next budget as well um so we
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
tried to make sure that we could um
 
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
effectively continue our Fleet and not
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles on page 21 just a few other
 
01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
things um technology upgrades with arpa
 
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
funds so um core 21 for rims that was
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
paid through arpa funds that was a $3
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
million arpa
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation we also upgraded our
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
high-speed scanner that's used to
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
process tax returns um significant uh
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
faster throughput speed automatic
 
01:31:50.189 --> 01:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
separation of documents so that really
 
01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
reduces our upfront manual work and um
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
improved image quality so these scanners
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
can read right off the page um making it
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
much easier for data entry
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
purposes we also modernized our
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
Equalization web application um to
 
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
include functionality for dr's
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
assessment review and modernized
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
platform for our ratio study and
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
Equalization functionality so the
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
highspeed scanner was $400,000 from arpa
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
and the equalization web application
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
upgrade was also
 
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
$400,000 so those were the three areas
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
where we received arpa funds those are
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
all like I said upgrades to existing
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
technology um and we negotiated with all
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
of these vendors to ensure that there
 
01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
would be no increase to support and
 
01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs so these really were
 
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
one-time um spend with one-time
 
01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
funds lastly in terms of budget
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
priorities customer service is always a
 
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
priority at Dr um in fiscal year 24 and
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 um if you call into our
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
call center you um can participate in a
 
01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
little survey at the end of the call
 
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
that has you rate on a scale from 1 to
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
five the
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
professionalism and knowledge knowledge
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
of your caller and 99% of our surveys
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
rate a three or higher um also when we
 
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
upgraded the rims tool to the core 21
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
latest version there were a number of
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
impr improvements to Granite tax connect
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
that online portal for
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um and we've seen great usage
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
of GTC so we have over 48,000 GTC users
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that core 21 upgrades um allows for
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
the ability um to pay review and update
 
01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
the payment plans that I mentioned
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
review power of attorney information
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
submit an appeal or dispute request
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
being able to do that electronically is
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
really um a great customer service
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
feature and then also submit requests
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
for um certificates of good standing and
 
01:34:01.229 --> 01:34:01.239 align:start position:0%
similar on the last slide we had
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
received specific questions um from the
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
chair so um one question was relative to
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
new general fund Appropriations so Dr
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
has not received any new general fund
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in the last five years
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
for any new
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
programs in terms of new positions um no
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
new full-time positions have been
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
established over the past 5 years years
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
dr's headcount reached a high of
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
218 in fiscal year 2010 and
 
01:34:34.109 --> 01:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
2011 um from fiscal year 2021 to the
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year 2025 our headcount
 
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
has reduced from 157 to
 
01:34:44.189 --> 01:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
153 and then there was a question about
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
whether General funds were used to
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
replace previously received arpa funds
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
and the answer to that is no as I
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned our ARA funds were only used
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
to upgrade existing technology and we
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
negotiated with those vendors to ensure
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
that there would be no increased um
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
support or maintenance costs associated
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
with those upgrades so again onetime um
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
money for onetime spend no increase um
 
01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
to the maintenance and support costs uh
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin you have a
 
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
question yeah with the um repeal of the
 
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax how is your
 
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
department dealing with that and is it
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
likely to lower the number of people
 
01:35:31.870 --> 01:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
that you have great question so um in
 
01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
the immediate term we are in the process
 
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
of sending out 990,000 letters to make
 
01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
sure that interested Dividends taxpayers
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
are aware of the repeal to make sure
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
that they don't file fiscal year 2025
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
estimates um we have a banner on our web
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
page we did not produce any 2025 forms
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
um and we have internal processes in
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
place to make sure that we hopefully do
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
not deposit any money that is sent to us
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
um inaccurately so if we receive a check
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
that we believe is an interest in
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
dividends estimate for 2025 where the
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
tax has been repealed we will be sending
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
those back to
 
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in terms of how it will impact
 
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
the department it's hard to know at this
 
01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.629 align:start position:0%
the department it's hard to know at this
point

01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:19.159 align:start position:0%
um some states organize their
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
Departments of Revenue by tax type right
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
so you'll have a sales tax department
 
01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
you'll have an income tax department um
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
we are not organized in that way all of
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
our staff P essentially participate in
 
01:36:36.270 --> 01:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
all tax types um the repeal of the
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax will not
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
fully impact us until after fiscal year
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
2025 so we will still receive interest
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
in dividends returns this spring on
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
April 15th and then there'll be some
 
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
audit and collection activity that will
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
occur until we fully wrap up the tax
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
I will say though that you will see in
 
01:36:58.109 --> 01:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
the agency budget we've reduced our
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
headcount by 18 um and some of those
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
positions are in our taxpayer Services
 
01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
Division and in our audit division while
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
they may not be directly tied to indd I
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
think we're able to kind of absorb um
 
01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
the unfund of those positions because
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
there will be less documents and such
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
coming through the department so I don't
 
01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
have an exact this many people work on
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
indd but I can say that I'm comfortable
 
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
with unfund those positions because
 
01:37:32.109 --> 01:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
there will be a shift in in our work
 
01:37:32.119 --> 01:37:33.910 align:start position:0%
there will be a shift in in our work
thank

01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
you I have a question on behalf of the
 
01:37:39.149 --> 01:37:39.159 align:start position:0%
chair because he couldn't be here um he
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
stated that we uh we allowed for a few
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
auditor positions in the last session
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
that we had give you some additional
 
01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
Auditors on the promise that they would
 
01:37:50.669 --> 01:37:50.679 align:start position:0%
be pulling their weight on the business
 
01:37:53.790 --> 01:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
tax collections how has that worked out
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
we um have proposed to unfund those
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
positions in the current budget we were
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
not able to successfully recruit for
 
01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
them um so in in Prior budgets um
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
positions have been added particularly
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
multi-state auditor positions um there's
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
usually Revenue associated with those
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
positions because these are the folks
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
that audit the large multinational
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
corporations um they do very complex
 
01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
work which makes them hard to find
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
so um we unfortunately just given the
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
current labor market um had not been
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
able to fill those positions um so they
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
are proposed to be unfunded um a number
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
of the vacant ones are proposed to be
 
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
unfunded in the current
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
budget and one additional thank you for
 
01:38:42.669 --> 01:38:42.679 align:start position:0%
that answer uh an additional question
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
from the chair um what in your mind
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
would be the least efficient tax to
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
collect in terms of expenses per dollar
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
receive uh and
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
and can it be improved
 
01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
upon the answer to that was probably the
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax um there were
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
a large number of Z or low doll filers
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
for interest in dividends um we have
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
just as many interest in dividends
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers roughly as we do business
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers indd in fiscal year 2024
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
brought in about 185 million and
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
business taxes are over a
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
billion um um so I think interest
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends is probably um the
 
01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
way I would answer that question of the
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
remaining taxes a lot of them are fairly
 
01:39:37.229 --> 01:39:37.239 align:start position:0%
efficient um the three other larger ones
 
01:39:39.149 --> 01:39:39.159 align:start position:0%
being the meals and rentals tax the
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax and the real estate transfer
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
tax those are collected in a more
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
efficient way so meals and rentals tax
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
is collected by the operator the
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
restaurant in for example you and I pay
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
the tax when we go but the collection is
 
01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
centralized with the operators so that
 
01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:01.639 align:start position:0%
definitely creates efficiency um with
 
01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
respect to the tobacco tax again that's
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
a tax on the consumer but it's
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
pre-collected by the wholesalers so
 
01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
again you have that efficiency not
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
having to tax each and every individual
 
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
purpose the tax is pre-collected by the
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and then the real estate
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
transfer tax that's collected at the
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
county level and then remitted to the
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
state so those sort sort of more
 
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
centralized collections I think lead to
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
um pretty good
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
efficiencies sen uh representative Ms
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I I've got a
 
01:40:37.629 --> 01:40:37.639 align:start position:0%
couple questions so bear with me sure so
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know to I'm looking on page 11 um at
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
the at the taxes yeah railroad tax
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um is I me know when talking
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
about efficiency I mean is that does
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
that require a lot of effort is it worth
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't um there is part of one
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
FTE that administers the rail railroad
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
tax um the railroad tax and the utility
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
property tax those taxes the the value
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
is set by the
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
Dr um and then we essentially build the
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
railroad or build the utility property
 
01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
based on the rate and statute and so
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
Railroad in particular is is less than
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
one FTE that's working on that okay and
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
then uh um you know a a broader question
 
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
um you know on page 22 you you kind of
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
talk about the um the you know the
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
evolution of your
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
headcount um I would imagine that the
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
mission of the department hasn't changed
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
significantly since fiscal year 2010
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
when you had 28
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
people um in fact you probably are doing
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
more than or being asked to the
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
legislature has asked you to do more
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
than you were asked to do back then and
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
your headcount now is you're proposing
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
is going to come down to
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
135 um I'd like to think that you know
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's all made you can you can do that
 
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
through you know all the wonderful
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that you've implemented I
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
but I guess my question is um you know
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
at 135 people do you have are do you
 
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
have the resources to fulfill the task
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has assigned to you
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
sure it will be a new normal um because
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
that will be the lowest headcount that
 
01:42:34.589 --> 01:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
we will have um in a number of years I
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
like I said I went back
 
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
to 2008 um so that'll be the lowest
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
headcount we've had since 2008 um but I
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
think there are a number of efficiencies
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
that we have gained one rims has
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
generated um significant efficiencies
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
for us two we have the repeal of the IND
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
and so we'll have some ability to adjust
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
our time um and then the other reason
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
why I'm confident again these are all
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
vacant positions and they've been vacant
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
for some time because hiring um has just
 
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
been difficult in the current
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
environment with the unemployment rate
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
being so low um every year the
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
department well on a monthly basis we
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
track and every year we publish um a
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
balance scorecard and so we monitor you
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
know the weight times on our phones we
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
monitor how quickly we're processing
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
refunds we're monitoring how quickly it
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
takes us to complete an audit we
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
understand audits are stressful for
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
businesses and we don't want to drag out
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
a stressful event so we monitor all
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
these things we monitor how quickly we
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
set Municipal tax rates we typically
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
turn them around in 24 hours um we're
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
monitoring all of our statistics and
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
they are all reaching or exceeding our
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
goals so I can say confidently that
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
today today with these positions
 
01:43:59.070 --> 01:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
vacant I'm able to meet the goals that
 
01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.750 align:start position:0%
vacant I'm able to meet the goals that
we've

01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
set um I think the hard part about
 
01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.470 align:start position:0%
set um I think the hard part about
unfund

01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
unfund
 
01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:10.149 align:start position:0%
unfund
positions

01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
is that might be a
 
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.589 align:start position:0%
is that might be a
position

01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
that if another position becomes vacant
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
if I have someone retire at some point
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
during the two years of the budget
 
01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
I might with these efficiencies and life
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
changing without IND I might find that
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
that unfunded that that person that
 
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
retired that I might not need that
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
position anymore and I'd really like to
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
fund one of those unfunded Auditors
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
because maybe I do now have someone
 
01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:42.830 align:start position:0%
because maybe I do now have someone
that's

01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
interested and so it would be helpful if
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
I had the flexibility during the budget
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to fill unfunded positions so
 
01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
long as I didn't exceed obviously the
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
amount of of money that the legislature
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
had appropriated to us that I would
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
sleep a little bit better at night
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
knowing that our with our headcount
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
going down to 135 if I had it had that
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
bit of flexibility just because we are
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
kind of moved moving into a bit of
 
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
Uncharted Territory with what life looks
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
like after indd and so that I think to
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
long-winded way of answering your
 
01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
question that would be something that
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
would um make me feel even more
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
confident that we could do it I'm
 
01:45:31.589 --> 01:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
confident the way it is but if there was
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
that flexibility um within the budget
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
then that would really make me feel more
 
01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
confident so so how would how would you
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
do that would you have you know let's
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
say you you'd have two just a number two
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
extra positions identified in the budget
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
with zero dollars associated with them
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
so my understanding but I would defer to
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
experts in this area um but there has
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
been language inserted into House Bill 2
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
for other departments in other budgets
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
that essentially says that the
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
department may fill unfunded positions
 
01:46:11.310 --> 01:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
during the bium provided that the total
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
expenditure for such positions does not
 
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
exceed the amount appropriated for
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel Services so I think that is
 
01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
where we would get the flexibility we
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
would still un fund the positions we
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
would go down to
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
135 but with this I could have the
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
flexibility that um if I stay within my
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
positions reprentative thank you have
 
01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
you expressed that desire to the
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
governor's office so with any luck that
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
language will show up in their draft of
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
their version of hb2 I have okay great I
 
01:46:55.629 --> 01:46:55.639 align:start position:0%
know they're all drinking from a fire
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
hose right now so um but that makes a
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
lot of sense so just um another question
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
maybe I glossed over it uh did you say
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
what you anticipate the rims um transfer
 
01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
to the operating budget cost will be so
 
01:47:22.510 --> 01:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
um the we will need an additional one
 
01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
and a half million in fiscal years 26
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
and 27 to fully operationalize rims and
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
so that is the cost of going to the
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
cloud and the maintenance on the cloud I
 
01:47:35.679 --> 01:47:36.550 align:start position:0%
cloud and the maintenance on the cloud I
have

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
absorbed about 800,000 of
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
that almost 900,000 of that by reducing
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
my time and materials for the
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
Consultants because I reduced that but
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
essentially what's going to be new in 26
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
27 which is the last amounts that will
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
need to be oper operationalized will be
 
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
about 1 and a half to 1.6 million in
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
each year and you've built that into
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
your budget request to the governor
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
correct it's not like it's an it's not
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
above and beyond it's in the agency
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
budget um that was submitted fully funds
 
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
rims so it's all in there great
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative Ms um thanks I I just
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
want to kind of do the the inverse of
 
01:48:24.669 --> 01:48:24.679 align:start position:0%
what I was asking earlier about Mission
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
um are there are there any things in
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
statute right now that create a
 
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679 align:start position:0%
requirement for you to have to do stuff
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
that um really doesn't make any sense
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
where where we you know what thing
 
01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
things that we should you should quite
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
frankly take out of Statute because it's
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
really no
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
longer um necessary or um
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate nothing immediately comes to
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
mind I mean I'm I'm sure I could dig and
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
find something but um I've been in this
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
position um for seven years so I've seen
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
most of what we do um on a daily basis
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
or a yearly basis at this point and also
 
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
I like to think that the Dr works well
 
01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
with legislators um when new laws are
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
passed you know we don't take a position
 
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
on legislation but we will be very
 
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
honest with folks whether it's something
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
we can administer or not or if we feel
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
like the administration of um a proposed
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
bill is more burdensome than it needs to
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
be and we like to work closely with
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislators um to make sure that it is
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's only what is needed and not not
 
01:49:39.790 --> 01:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
anything else so there's not anything
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
that is coming to mind regularly that
 
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
I'm like ah I wish we could not do this
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
um I guess I guess the the kind of thing
 
01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
I was thinking of is you know is there
 
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
some some Legacy annual report that has
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
to get produced that nobody reads I like
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
to think people read our annual
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
reports we have a nice page on our
 
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:05.719 align:start position:0%
website um no we're not overly report
 
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
burdened we do have some obligations to
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
notify the legislature of things um
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the year but it's not it's
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
not a burden I don't believe and it's I
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
find it helpful because then I'm made
 
01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
aware of it when I go to sign that
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
letter um so no I I don't think
 
01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
so are there any other other questions I
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative evil I I'm looking for a
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
little education on swep so
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
um you were talking about the efficiency
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
of collections so anyway you can tell me
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
about how they're collected I know some
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
keep others don't and I'm curious about
 
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
the rate because I don't recall it and
 
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about about the um program
 
01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned for folks to not have
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
to pay it based on their income sure so
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
um the Statewide education property tax
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
is set in statute at
 
01:51:07.599 --> 01:51:09.229 align:start position:0%
is set in statute at
363

01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
363
 
01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:11.800 align:start position:0%
million um it was lowered a couple years
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
ago briefly to 263 but it is back to 363
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
million and the Dr is responsible for
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
notifying the municip alties each M
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
municipality how much of that 363
 
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
million they need to collect and so that
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
amount is included when we set the tax
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
rates the amount that a municipality
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
collects from swept is retained locally
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
so it is essentially state revenue
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see it on the revenue
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
plan um but it is collected and retained
 
01:51:51.719 --> 01:51:56.229 align:start position:0%
plan um but it is collected and retained
locally

01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
what was the other part of your
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
question oh the low and moderate
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
property tax relief right so if you meet
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
certain criteria in terms of the value
 
01:52:09.069 --> 01:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
of your home and your assets the amount
 
01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
of money that you make you can request
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
um essentially a rebate of a portion of
 
01:52:19.470 --> 01:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
the swept tax that you paid and so that
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
kicks off in the beginning of May of
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
every every year and um we work with
 
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:26.750 align:start position:0%
every every year and um we work with
like

01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
AARP we work with the cities in towns to
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that we get um publicity out
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
about the program we also always offer
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
that folks can come to the Dr and will
 
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
assist them with filling out that rebate
 
01:52:43.229 --> 01:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
um so that's a yearly program and like I
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
said we've been sending back um to
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
Residents or Property Owners somewhere
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
between a million and a million and a
 
01:52:53.950 --> 01:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
half dollars in total um over the past
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
few years is is that uh rebate um
 
01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
application available online yep it's
 
01:53:02.589 --> 01:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
available online um through granite tax
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
connect and they can check the status of
 
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
it as it moves through the process and
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
is it fairly easy to fill out for people
 
01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
it's fairly easy and if folks like I
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
said have any difficulty they're more
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
than welcome to call us or come in and
 
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.040 align:start position:0%

heavy into promoting travel and tourism
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire uh we
 
02:17:14.669 --> 02:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
also manage the welcome centers that
 
02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully you've had the opportunity to
 
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
visit on our highways we have state
 
02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
Planning and Zoning Workforce housing is
 
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
a big area we uh focus on as well we've
 
02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519 align:start position:0%
been instrumental in the Broadband
 
02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
expansion program in the state of New
 
02:17:28.950 --> 02:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we also have an outdoor
 
02:17:33.309 --> 02:17:33.319 align:start position:0%
recreation office um we are a young
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
agency within the state we were
 
02:17:40.509 --> 02:17:40.519 align:start position:0%
established in 2017 under RSA 120 and we
 
02:17:43.870 --> 02:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
C we currently consist of two divisions
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
offices and many
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
departments as I said we um our
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
divisions are Economic Development and
 
02:17:53.709 --> 02:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism our lead office is
 
02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
planning within this budget cycle we are
 
02:17:59.429 --> 02:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
looking to formalize in an RSA the
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
planning um office into a division as
 
02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
well and under that division which I'll
 
02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
go into a little bit further detail in
 
02:18:09.549 --> 02:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
another page we are looking to have some
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
of our other key departments housed
 
02:18:14.190 --> 02:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
underneath that division in our
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
accounting structure our mission is very
 
02:18:18.589 --> 02:18:18.599 align:start position:0%
simply stated is to Steward New
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy and quality of life
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
our vision is an economy that provides
 
02:18:25.389 --> 02:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
Prosperity balanced with New Hampshire's
 
02:18:28.030 --> 02:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
Grandeur on page four is our current
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
organizational structure as it exists in
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
our budget like I said we have two um
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
divisions currently and we have multiple
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
offices on page five we detail our plan
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
that we have spent a lot of time uh and
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
thought and we it is a progressive plan
 
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
in developing this division of planning
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
and community development as I said in
 
02:18:54.309 --> 02:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
the current structure it is in the
 
02:18:56.190 --> 02:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
current rsas it is the office of
 
02:18:58.589 --> 02:18:58.599 align:start position:0%
planning but we are looking to make it
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
the division of planning and Community
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
Development formally in this budget
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
cycle and in as we do that it will
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
Encompass housing as well as Broadband
 
02:19:11.629 --> 02:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
under that these are areas that under
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
the um current structure there within
 
02:19:16.349 --> 02:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
economic development but honestly they
 
02:19:18.030 --> 02:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
really belong under planning and zoning
 
02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
and the instead of working cross um
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
divisions and departments they will all
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
be under one Division and work much more
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
efficiently and collaboratively within
 
02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:30.549 align:start position:0%
efficiently and collaboratively within
our

02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:19:34.110 --> 02:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
agency on starting on page six we
 
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
started in our presentation to start
 
02:19:37.950 --> 02:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit Miss Frederickson
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
let me just as long as we're on page
 
02:19:41.790 --> 02:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
five it'll be useful to have this more
 
02:19:45.870 --> 02:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
like an or chart with um number of
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
Personnel in each of these boxes right
 
02:19:50.830 --> 02:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
so we can certainly provide that we are
 
02:19:52.270 --> 02:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
like I said we are an agency of people
 
02:19:55.349 --> 02:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
and programs we have 78 staff members uh
 
02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
78 positions in the budget four are
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
unclassified and 74 are classified
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
positions I've also looked at the
 
02:20:06.670 --> 02:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
percentage um 71% of those positions are
 
02:20:08.190 --> 02:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
generally funded the remainder fall
 
02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
under Turnpike and other great thank you
 
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome keep going
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative M could I ask a
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
question and absolutely do you mind if
 
02:20:19.309 --> 02:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
we ask questions no problem thank you
 
02:20:21.309 --> 02:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't we wait till
 
02:20:22.990 --> 02:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
of it is done
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay um so when we developed this
 
02:20:29.070 --> 02:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
presentation we kind of structured a
 
02:20:30.830 --> 02:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
little bit to talk about the different
 
02:20:33.309 --> 02:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
activity centers in the budget and then
 
02:20:35.309 --> 02:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
go into the actual budget request itself
 
02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to give kind of like an
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
overview of the different activities um
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
so what their key function areas are so
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
you can see um on page six we talk about
 
02:20:46.590 --> 02:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner that's
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
really kind of where you know most of
 
02:20:50.349 --> 02:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
our indirect activities exist that's
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
where our leadership is our business
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
office functions fall under there our HR
 
02:20:59.309 --> 02:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
follows under there um and a lot of the
 
02:21:01.389 --> 02:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
planning for the agency occurs in this
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
area and it's detailed in here this is
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
where our budget request is for the
 
02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office and that office is
 
02:21:14.349 --> 02:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
80 83% General funded 12% federal funds
 
02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
um and then there's other funds the
 
02:21:18.750 --> 02:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
general funded piece of the welcome
 
02:21:21.150 --> 02:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
centers does fall under this C category
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
as well um and we listed the different
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
directors that fall into this area as
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
well if you go on to page seven this is
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
also um an additional extension of the
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner but this is
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the welcome centers
 
02:21:37.710 --> 02:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
that fall under the turnpike fund
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
because we do receive um Turnpike
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
funding for the welcome centers that are
 
02:21:47.309 --> 02:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
system um I'm not sure if there's any
 
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
par we can if there are any questions on
 
02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
that we can address those towards the
 
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
end um on page eight as I said we have
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
multiple offices as well it was
 
02:22:01.309 --> 02:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
important to us to highlight that under
 
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office we do have an
 
02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
office of outdoor recreation this
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
particular office is very valuable and
 
02:22:10.750 --> 02:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
helping out with different areas of um
 
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
bolstering the outdoor recreation
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
community this particular office is
 
02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
federally funded but it is in our budget
 
02:22:19.389 --> 02:22:19.399 align:start position:0%
so it's important to note to us there
 
02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
are a lot of inititive Ives that are
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
very important to um also highlighting
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
and bringing in tourism into our
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
communities on page nine we have um
 
02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
highlights of the Department of Economic
 
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
Development if actually to your point as
 
02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
well we do notate on the top of each one
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
of these areas how many staff members
 
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
are in each of these um focus
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
areas so we we have key results within
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
these areas and I know commissioner
 
02:22:52.750 --> 02:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
aswell wanted to when he came to talk in
 
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
more detail about
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
these um because the on page 10 there's
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
also highlights of the office of
 
02:23:01.870 --> 02:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
Planning and
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
Development as I said because that's the
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
current uh way that planning and
 
02:23:08.830 --> 02:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
development is in the rsas that's why
 
02:23:10.349 --> 02:23:10.359 align:start position:0%
it's notated as Planning and Development
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
our future plan is again division of
 
02:23:14.190 --> 02:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
planning and Community Development for
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
this area but as you can see there's you
 
02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
know many um key accomplishments for
 
02:23:22.110 --> 02:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
this particular area and the budget
 
02:23:25.550 --> 02:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
requests are detailed here as well the
 
02:23:27.550 --> 02:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
other division on page 11 is the
 
02:23:29.870 --> 02:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
division of travel and tourism this
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
particular division is um dictated by
 
02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
RSA which is mentioned at the bottom of
 
02:23:38.830 --> 02:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
the page their budget is dictated by RSA
 
02:23:42.349 --> 02:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
1211b and that's 3.15% of the meals and
 
02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
um rental tax starting on page
 
02:23:51.309 --> 02:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
11 is where um I start to Det detail out
 
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
the budget requests that we have put in
 
02:23:58.830 --> 02:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
we were given a target of just over $17
 
02:24:03.469 --> 02:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
million to meet we met with um Division
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
and department leaders within our agency
 
02:24:11.070 --> 02:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
to put this budget together in a very um
 
02:24:13.269 --> 02:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
methodical man manner to make sure that
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
we were looking at all efficiencies and
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that we were really putting
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
together a very thoughtful and
 
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
financially um prudent budget and we met
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
the target numbers that we were given we
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
do have some additional prioritized
 
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
needs in here we were very thoughtful in
 
02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
putting those requests in understanding
 
02:24:34.469 --> 02:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
that those are probably requests that
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
won't be met in this budget cycle
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
however they are areas of need that we
 
02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
did want to notate in in our budget
 
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
request understanding that it's probably
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
not likely something that we will be
 
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
able to do in this cycle but it's was
 
02:24:52.110 --> 02:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
something that we felt important enough
 
02:24:54.150 --> 02:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
to put in this request one of the
 
02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
positions that is in there is a position
 
02:24:58.830 --> 02:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh in the office of planning and
 
02:25:02.349 --> 02:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
development that will if if we are able
 
02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
to do that it will be um 75% federally
 
02:25:08.910 --> 02:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
funded and have a state
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
match so with that if you take a look at
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
our budget our request um our overall
 
02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
budget 49% of our overall budget in the
 
02:25:21.309 --> 02:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
FY 26 year the request is 4 9% generally
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
funded 46% federally funded just under
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
4% Turnpike and just under 1%
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
other like I said we we did everything
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
that we could to look at every
 
02:25:36.349 --> 02:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
particular area and make sure that we
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
were um making the best decisions and
 
02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
putting in this
 
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
request if you go to page 13 we've uh
 
02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
broken it out to the different activity
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
areas so that you can actually see the
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
details of our request
 
02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
um the office of the commissioner it it
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
would be uh for the efficiency budget in
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
FY 26 3.6 million for
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
and almost 3.7 million for FY
 
02:26:08.429 --> 02:26:08.439 align:start position:0%
27 we had some different things that we
 
02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
had to consider when we were looking at
 
02:26:11.870 --> 02:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
this budget we had to make some budget
 
02:26:16.190 --> 02:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
Corrections for example um we looked at
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
prior year we looked at fy2 24 spending
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
for comparison when we put I request for
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
example so you know we looked at need
 
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
anticipated future need prior
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
spending programs that are currently
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
going on programs that we might
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate when looking at all of this
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
and um what was in there so what's
 
02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
detailed here for example is we had to
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
make a correction to like the S cap that
 
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
was um budgeted in here we a predecessor
 
02:26:50.590 --> 02:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
incorrectly put it in at the amount
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
instead of just the non-general funds
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
amount so there's a correction for for
 
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
that in here for example so that's why
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's notated in here we uh there's a
 
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
variance in here because we had to we
 
02:27:06.269 --> 02:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
moved a position uh into the office of
 
02:27:11.269 --> 02:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
planning for the division um creation so
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
we we've very carefully looked at all of
 
02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
these different areas when we were doing
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
this we were very methodical in what we
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
put in for requests
 
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
um although I will say oh there's
 
02:27:25.630 --> 02:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner cwell now when you go to
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
page 14 we did even the same thing when
 
02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
we looked at um the turnpike welcome
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
centers we we looked at you know what
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
was a spend that was a need or a want if
 
02:27:42.030 --> 02:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
it was a want we
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
it we didn't put it in here because this
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
is this is a budget where we have we
 
02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
have to look at what's only needed and
 
02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
so so that's what the request is all
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
about in here even on the turnpike side
 
02:27:58.630 --> 02:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
we flat budgeted on the turnpike side we
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
worked together with the turnpike um
 
02:28:03.469 --> 02:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
people to come up with this number as
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
well and they were good with that number
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
if you look at page 15 um that is the
 
02:28:10.910 --> 02:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Economic development's
 
02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
number we did see an increase in
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
salaries in this department this is
 
02:28:17.349 --> 02:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Economic Development is
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
our second highest um draw draw um draw
 
02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
our second highest um draw draw um draw
on

02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:28:26.309 --> 02:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
salaries so and because Bea has a
 
02:28:29.269 --> 02:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
longevity in its staff so we do have
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
step increases and things like that
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
going on in here and so we had to
 
02:28:35.389 --> 02:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
account for all of
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
that um but and then that we had to look
 
02:28:42.990 --> 02:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
at in in deed in Department of Economic
 
02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
Development for example they do have an
 
02:28:47.469 --> 02:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
aging vehicle in there so we made shifts
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
within we looked at um like rep cars and
 
02:28:53.550 --> 02:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
travel and was there something that we
 
02:28:56.190 --> 02:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
could potentially sacrifice there for
 
02:28:59.469 --> 02:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
one year so that we could get a vehicle
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
in the budget in order for them
 
02:29:05.830 --> 02:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
to re um get the vehicle could they
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
sacrifice maybe one trip and do it you
 
02:29:10.429 --> 02:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
know via a virtual meeting or something
 
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
like that so we've looked very closely
 
02:29:15.870 --> 02:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
at all of this stuff um and on page 16
 
02:29:18.190 --> 02:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
is the budget for office and Planning
 
02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
Development this is an area that does
 
02:29:24.429 --> 02:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
not fully um tap into the general funds
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
there are General funds as you can see
 
02:29:27.710 --> 02:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
but we also receive federal funding in
 
02:29:28.990 --> 02:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
program um there as I mentioned a little
 
02:29:34.110 --> 02:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
while ago there is a request in the
 
02:29:36.349 --> 02:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs for one flood plane
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
coordinator this particular program here
 
02:29:42.110 --> 02:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
does have requirements on the federal
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
side because of the flood plane
 
02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
management um so that request is in
 
02:29:51.790 --> 02:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
there um currently we are satisfying
 
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
that through a 9t and we can continue
 
02:29:55.389 --> 02:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
that if
 
02:29:59.269 --> 02:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
necessary um we do there are changes as
 
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
I mentioned in um when we were talking
 
02:30:03.150 --> 02:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
about the commissioner's budget there
 
02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
are some increases within here because
 
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the um division that we're looking to
 
02:30:10.030 --> 02:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
form we had to shift some money back and
 
02:30:11.269 --> 02:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
forth so that you'll see some
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
adjustments in there there's also an
 
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
increase because we have um Staffing
 
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
included in here now for the housing
 
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
Champions program
 
02:30:23.590 --> 02:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
if you go to page 17 we have the travel
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
and tourism budget this is the program
 
02:30:28.030 --> 02:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
where I mentioned a short time ago this
 
02:30:30.349 --> 02:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
is dictated by RSA that it's
 
02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
3.15% of the meals and Rental tax
 
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
revenue this is a program that um we has
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
shown and there's a table provided it it
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
it has shown that for every dollar spent
 
02:30:44.590 --> 02:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
the the most recent return on investment
 
02:30:48.030 --> 02:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
is $17 to the meals and Rental tax
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
revenue so um that that's an important
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
program as well and I know commissioner
 
02:30:55.389 --> 02:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
Caswell would like to speak more on the
 
02:30:55.399 --> 02:30:56.349 align:start position:0%
Caswell would like to speak more on the
different

02:30:56.349 --> 02:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:30:59.230 --> 02:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
programs on page 18 we were we were
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
given a request to provide additional
 
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
information so um I've only been at the
 
02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
agency for a year and a half so this was
 
02:31:07.630 --> 02:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
a fun exercise for me it gave me the
 
02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity being a numbers nerd I guess
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
to do some more digging into um Bea in
 
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
the past I took a look at programs
 
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
established over the last 5 years and
 
02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
and so here is that information that I
 
02:31:26.190 --> 02:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
know was requested of us to find we um
 
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the past 5 years housing Champions
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
was established within our agency and we
 
02:31:33.269 --> 02:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
were given $5.25 million for programs
 
02:31:35.550 --> 02:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
and administration on that program State
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
invest NH was also established $10
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
million was given for that the Pulp and
 
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
Paper manufacturing program was
 
02:31:44.110 --> 02:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
established we were given $1.5 million
 
02:31:46.349 --> 02:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
which is fully obligated the welcome
 
02:31:50.429 --> 02:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
centers um maybe doesn't quite fit into
 
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
that request
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the general fund I feel
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
like that was a new program because in
 
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
2019 that program went from Highway
 
02:32:03.429 --> 02:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
funding to General funds uh it was my
 
02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
understanding after doing some digging
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
that the highway fund could no longer
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
support the welcome centers and at the
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
time the general fund was able to
 
02:32:13.469 --> 02:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
support it so it became a new program
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
for the general fund so that's noted
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
here and also the office of strategic
 
02:32:21.269 --> 02:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
initiatives um was transferred over to
 
02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
the office of Planning and
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
Development uh it's also while I was
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
doing my research I also came across two
 
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh programs within Bea that were no
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
longer and that was the office of um
 
02:32:35.910 --> 02:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
wind and that moved over to the
 
02:32:37.309 --> 02:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and the Bureau of
 
02:32:40.269 --> 02:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
film and media was repealed and that
 
02:32:40.279 --> 02:32:41.309 align:start position:0%
film and media was repealed and that
office

02:32:41.309 --> 02:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
closed on page 19 we were also asked to
 
02:32:48.910 --> 02:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
talk about positions and when I took a
 
02:32:51.150 --> 02:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
look at that again that was also a very
 
02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
interesting exercise for me I uh was
 
02:32:58.269 --> 02:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
able to find that we this I knew because
 
02:32:59.790 --> 02:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
I had come to the agency at this point
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
but three positions were established for
 
02:33:01.439 --> 02:33:02.349 align:start position:0%
but three positions were established for
housing

02:33:02.349 --> 02:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:33:05.469 --> 02:33:05.479 align:start position:0%
Champions um there was also a position
 
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
established for the director of
 
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental Affairs I think most
 
02:33:10.429 --> 02:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
of you know jeie who is here and that is
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
her position and at that time as I
 
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
started looking at this I could see that
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of the stuff was actually also
 
02:33:18.670 --> 02:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
done very methodically which I can
 
02:33:20.750 --> 02:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate in my position because for
 
02:33:21.870 --> 02:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
example for the director of
 
02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental Affairs there was
 
02:33:26.110 --> 02:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
another position that was abolished when
 
02:33:30.269 --> 02:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
that came in um we also as I was going
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
through everything I also found two
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
other positions that were abolished
 
02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:33:37.349 --> 02:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
retained when the offices were re um
 
02:33:39.950 --> 02:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
repealed which I thought was actually a
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
very nice thing to do as well um and
 
02:33:43.910 --> 02:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
those I listed those as well as
 
02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:45.750 align:start position:0%
those I listed those as well as
additional

02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:33:49.269 --> 02:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
information on page 20 uh we were also
 
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
asked to about continuation programs and
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
this was an opportunity to list um a lot
 
02:33:58.750 --> 02:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
of the cares act and ARA programs that
 
02:34:02.190 --> 02:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
we have managed very successful I think
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh we do have some of those programs
 
02:34:05.269 --> 02:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
complete and then a lot of those
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
programs very nearly Complete because
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everybody's very familiar that
 
02:34:12.550 --> 02:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
arpa has a lot of deadlines coming up an
 
02:34:14.309 --> 02:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
obligation one that's passed and spend
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
that's going to be very soon um and so
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
the programs are listed here and looking
 
02:34:21.309 --> 02:34:21.319 align:start position:0%
at all all of these I know it's very
 
02:34:23.349 --> 02:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
important to find out you know what is
 
02:34:23.359 --> 02:34:24.230 align:start position:0%
important to find out you know what is
the

02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
continuation um effect to the agency and
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
after looking at all of this stuff the
 
02:34:32.110 --> 02:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
continuation effect that we really just
 
02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
see in this is the impact in our
 
02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
department of you know how are we going
 
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
to um support affordable housing
 
02:34:41.349 --> 02:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
initiatives and what we saw was the our
 
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
housing champion and state invested each
 
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
program that that will be the continuing
 
02:34:48.830 --> 02:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
effect that we see within our department
 
02:34:50.990 --> 02:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
um one thing that
 
02:34:53.950 --> 02:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
um was not mentioned but is something is
 
02:34:56.590 --> 02:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
also a very big program for us is iig
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
money we do have iig I iig ja money that
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
is um very substantial in our department
 
02:35:06.309 --> 02:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
as well we have $196 million that will
 
02:35:07.710 --> 02:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
be continuing through
 
02:35:11.309 --> 02:35:11.319 align:start position:0%
2032 so we are pretty busy for a small
 
02:35:15.070 --> 02:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
agency we have a lot going on iig J yeah
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
the the infrastructure money is that
 
02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
what you list here as broadband and
 
02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
capital fund program it is not it is not
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
that what's listed there it that the
 
02:35:27.269 --> 02:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
capital fund program money is arpa money
 
02:35:29.630 --> 02:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
we also have um and here's where
 
02:35:32.429 --> 02:35:32.439 align:start position:0%

Congress to to um accelerate Broadband
 
02:35:58.240 --> 02:35:59.550 align:start position:0%
Congress to to um accelerate Broadband
infrastructure

02:35:59.550 --> 02:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
implementation uh we had used funds
 
02:36:04.910 --> 02:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
under arpa which was a different pot of
 
02:36:08.670 --> 02:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
money uh earlier on that's the 122 that
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
you see there and th those funds have
 
02:36:12.269 --> 02:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
been pretty much expended at this point
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
the bead funds have not yet been fully
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
expanded and they have a much longer
 
02:36:21.150 --> 02:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
Horizon but they came separate from arpa
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
E A yeah so uh
 
02:36:29.630 --> 02:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
Broadband Equity accessibility and
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
development I think is the name of the
 
02:36:36.429 --> 02:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
statute but it was part
 
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
of um a second pot of money that
 
02:36:41.950 --> 02:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
Congress passed in
 
02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
2021 specifically for infrastructure
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
enhancements and they called it at first
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
the and don't ask me to tell you what
 
02:36:51.389 --> 02:36:51.399 align:start position:0%
the stands for the iig
 
02:36:54.389 --> 02:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
ja which eventually became the
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisan infrastructure law and so
 
02:36:58.830 --> 02:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
they've called it a couple of different
 
02:37:01.790 --> 02:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
things but that is the source of the
 
02:37:04.830 --> 02:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
bead funding sorry for the acronyms I
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't like them anymore than you do can
 
02:37:11.309 --> 02:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
you give us at some later time um more
 
02:37:13.269 --> 02:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
of an overview of what you're spending
 
02:37:15.790 --> 02:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
on broadband and what's done and what is
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
yet to do kind of absolutely yeah
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
including dollar amounts great all right
 
02:37:23.469 --> 02:37:23.479 align:start position:0%
let's go to representative muns for a
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
question first thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner um and and um
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
Kathy um what what is the difference
 
02:37:36.670 --> 02:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
between an office and a Division I mean
 
02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
you know why make the change because it
 
02:37:42.469 --> 02:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
looks from the organization chart that
 
02:37:44.670 --> 02:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
the office of planning and development
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
and the proposed division of Planning
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
and Development would have the same
 
02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.030 align:start position:0%
and Development would have the same
functional

02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
functional
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
breakout so this is a a a a management
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh based
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
decision um we have two
 
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
divisions well well two existing
 
02:38:05.469 --> 02:38:05.479 align:start position:0%
divisions Economic Development travel
 
02:38:05.479 --> 02:38:06.510 align:start position:0%
divisions Economic Development travel
tourism

02:38:06.510 --> 02:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
02:38:09.150 --> 02:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
development uh I can't really speak to
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
the difference between office and
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
Division I think office is traditionally
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
seen in state government is smaller than
 
02:38:18.349 --> 02:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
a division but uh I recall at some point
 
02:38:20.110 --> 02:38:20.120 align:start position:0%
somebody said well they really isn't
 
02:38:23.630 --> 02:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
anything called an office in state law
 
02:38:26.950 --> 02:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
so um but everybody uses it so I'm not
 
02:38:30.510 --> 02:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
trying to make an excuse but the the the
 
02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
the the the management decision we made
 
02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
to to establish the division of planning
 
02:38:37.630 --> 02:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
and Community Development was to not
 
02:38:39.550 --> 02:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
just have the office of planning and
 
02:38:41.750 --> 02:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
development but to add the affordable
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
housing work that we've been doing and
 
02:38:47.150 --> 02:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
the Broadband work and those are three
 
02:38:49.030 --> 02:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
areas where we have a significant
 
02:38:51.550 --> 02:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
Interac action with municipalities
 
02:38:53.870 --> 02:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
directly so with planning zoning
 
02:38:56.150 --> 02:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
broadband and Housing Development
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the invest inh funds
 
02:39:01.870 --> 02:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
were focused on Municipal support so we
 
02:39:04.349 --> 02:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
put that was one reason why they went
 
02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
there the other reason was because as
 
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about the housing
 
02:39:11.429 --> 02:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
fund and the Broadband
 
02:39:14.710 --> 02:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
funding the the vast majority of the of
 
02:39:16.349 --> 02:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
the funding that we use for those
 
02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
programs is federal in nature and it's
 
02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:20.030 align:start position:0%
programs is federal in nature and it's
significant

02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
and so we had previously had them being
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
managed within our division of Economic
 
02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
Development which was already our
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
largest division so this was an ability
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
to take some common functions put them
 
02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
in a new division so that it would be
 
02:39:36.670 --> 02:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
easier for our staff to manage um
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
because you know uh all of the stuff
 
02:39:43.150 --> 02:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
that DED does on top of having broadband
 
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
and in in invest became a difficult
 
02:39:47.590 --> 02:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
thing to manage so we set it up this way
 
02:39:50.389 --> 02:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
so that it'd be a little better for us
 
02:39:52.630 --> 02:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
does the change in designation from
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
office to division does that do anything
 
02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:39:57.680 --> 02:39:59.190 align:start position:0%
to um
upgrade

02:39:59.190 --> 02:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
the the position that's managing it does
 
02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
it change the salary structure so we re
 
02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
we took a position that had been uh uh
 
02:40:12.269 --> 02:40:12.279 align:start position:0%
in a different area and reclassified it
 
02:40:15.150 --> 02:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
to become the director of that position
 
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
a director of that Division I should say
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
so uh and we we held a um you know a u a
 
02:40:25.710 --> 02:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
full process um and had interviews and
 
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
that individual that's in that director
 
02:40:31.469 --> 02:40:31.479 align:start position:0%
position now um was selected for for the
 
02:40:34.190 --> 02:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
job to manage all three of those areas
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
planning housing and
 
02:40:39.910 --> 02:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
Broadband the reclassification it the
 
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
reclassification was a lateral move it
 
02:40:45.790 --> 02:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
was already the same the same level in
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
another area yeah so let me go to a
 
02:40:52.510 --> 02:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
different thing um travel and tourism
 
02:40:55.269 --> 02:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
visitor Services outdoor recreation and
 
02:40:58.150 --> 02:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
welcome centers all those seem to be
 
02:41:01.070 --> 02:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
related but they're in three different
 
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
high level groups here some are office
 
02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
of commissioner office of I guess these
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
are two office of
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner groups and then travel and
 
02:41:13.230 --> 02:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
tourism yeah so I can definitely speak
 
02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's a great question the uh Bureau of
 
02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
visitor Services is the welcome centers
 
02:41:21.389 --> 02:41:21.399 align:start position:0%
so that that they're the same thing um
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
they when we first got were established
 
02:41:27.150 --> 02:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
they were managed under travel and
 
02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
tourism development um you got to
 
02:41:33.070 --> 02:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
understand the distinction between the
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
operational function of running 12
 
02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
welcome centers and all of the
 
02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
components that go with that maintaining
 
02:41:42.790 --> 02:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
the buildings maintaining the grounds
 
02:41:45.790 --> 02:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
hiring and managing a significant staff
 
02:41:47.950 --> 02:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
of part-time individuals among 12
 
02:41:50.590 --> 02:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
different centers is a fundamentally
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
different set of management skills than
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
running a marketing and promotional
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
program so um I made the decision early
 
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
on to put BV the Bureau of visitor
 
02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
services and the Welcome Center
 
02:42:06.269 --> 02:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
management under my office um rather
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
than um expect someone I am hiring to
 
02:42:12.349 --> 02:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
run a marketing program to know how to
 
02:42:14.590 --> 02:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
do you know how to manage that type of
 
02:42:17.070 --> 02:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
function so that's the reason for that
 
02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
separation as for the off outdoor
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
industry uh outdoor recreation the
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
reason why that is different is is
 
02:42:30.230 --> 02:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
really exclusively policy and so bear
 
02:42:31.870 --> 02:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
with me for just a moment but there are
 
02:42:34.349 --> 02:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
about 20 states that have an office of
 
02:42:36.830 --> 02:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation and in most of those
 
02:42:40.030 --> 02:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
States they are using that office as a
 
02:42:42.670 --> 02:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
tourism add-on they're just saying look
 
02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
we've got a great outdoor recreation
 
02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's what they do um I didn't
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
want that we already had that we have
 
02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
the division travel tourism So ba and
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire the office of
 
02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation is really aimed at
 
02:43:00.910 --> 02:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
using outdoor recreation as a way to
 
02:43:02.910 --> 02:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
attract business and to attract
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce and to retain Workforce so
 
02:43:09.150 --> 02:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
it's very it's it's it's a different uh
 
02:43:11.710 --> 02:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
uh purpose and in order to make sure
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
that that is managed and it comes out
 
02:43:15.670 --> 02:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
that way at the other end of the the
 
02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
state government pipe I wanted that to
 
02:43:20.429 --> 02:43:20.439 align:start position:0%
be um report according to me and not
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
under the uh travel and tourism division
 
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
because I really see that as a
 
02:43:27.870 --> 02:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
distinction that is important not just
 
02:43:29.510 --> 02:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
because I don't like necessarily being
 
02:43:32.349 --> 02:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
like other states but also because
 
02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
that's how we use outdoor wck in New
 
02:43:36.630 --> 02:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we already know it's a
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
great tourism destination and we have a
 
02:43:41.670 --> 02:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
division and that's their job right so
 
02:43:43.070 --> 02:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
and there's more to tourism than outdoor
 
02:43:45.630 --> 02:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
recreation so that's maybe a long-winded
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
answer as to why that's set up that way
 
02:43:49.790 --> 02:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
so would that then be more like Economic
 
02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
Development or it's a crossover for sure
 
02:43:56.830 --> 02:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you um rep representative
 
02:43:58.990 --> 02:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
Cel thank you Mr chair uh could you
 
02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
clarify something um the direct the
 
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
director had previously stated under the
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
orc chart that there are 78 staff
 
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
members there were 74 classified four
 
02:44:11.070 --> 02:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
unclassified but when I add up the
 
02:44:14.230 --> 02:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
numbers of the individual pages that
 
02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
where you gave staff detail it adds up
 
02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
to 105
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
78 versus 105 could you uh reconcile
 
02:44:27.309 --> 02:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
that for me maybe some are unfilled is
 
02:44:32.030 --> 02:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:39.070 --> 02:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
it yeah you have 36 and 25 and 1 and 24
 
02:44:41.389 --> 02:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
and 10 and
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
nine so what am I
 
02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
Mission the I apologize the on the uh
 
02:44:50.389 --> 02:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
Bureau of visitor service
 
02:44:53.469 --> 02:44:53.479 align:start position:0%
that um that includes some
 
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
um I believe that's the one that's
 
02:45:01.429 --> 02:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:04.190 --> 02:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll double check those numbers
 
02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
when we originally um fact gathered from
 
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
the different departments and then
 
02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
reconciled against the actual position I
 
02:45:12.510 --> 02:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
had to adjust those numbers that were
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
reported by the department heads because
 
02:45:16.990 --> 02:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
they included um also part-time
 
02:45:20.590 --> 02:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
positions and and uh 9s and all of that
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
but we're only focusing on budgeted
 
02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
positions so I apologize I will double
 
02:45:24.399 --> 02:45:27.070 align:start position:0%
positions so I apologize I will double
check

02:45:27.070 --> 02:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
that representative run thank you Mr
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
chair um as far as the welcome centers
 
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
and excuse me I I probably should know
 
02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
this but you said we have 12 of them
 
02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
where are they
 
02:45:45.870 --> 02:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
located all right quiz time right so uh
 
02:45:50.269 --> 02:45:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
Canterbury um uh s Sor right across from
 
02:45:56.429 --> 02:45:56.439 align:start position:0%
the southbound version of the Canterbury
 
02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
one out 93 um Littleton colbrook inil
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
Conway um Sutton Lebanon
 
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
and missing one other on 89 hooks it oh
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
well yeah hooks it hooks it North and
 
02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
southbound um and then I'm missing one
 
02:46:17.309 --> 02:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
on Springfield oh okay thank you pretty
 
02:46:18.590 --> 02:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
good I'll try to remember let me see if
 
02:46:20.349 --> 02:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
I should know them better quick but I
 
02:46:22.670 --> 02:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate okay no that's okay um and
 
02:46:25.469 --> 02:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
then uh a couple other questions some of
 
02:46:27.030 --> 02:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
the welcome centers and I'm I'm thinking
 
02:46:30.590 --> 02:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the one I pass on in hooks it um one
 
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
on North and southbound Lanes do do we
 
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
get revenue from the vendors who operate
 
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
there I think Common Man operates there
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
we do not that is a contract between do
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the managers of that position so of
 
02:46:49.469 --> 02:46:49.479 align:start position:0%
that facil those two facilities um so
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
our role in hookit is to staff the desks
 
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
that are there we don't have the same
 
02:46:58.030 --> 02:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance um function at the at hooks
 
02:46:59.670 --> 02:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
at North and southbound that we do at
 
02:47:01.950 --> 02:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
all the other welcome centers oh okay so
 
02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
we're Staffing that desk when you first
 
02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
walk in that's our people okay thank you
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
and then uh my final question is as far
 
02:47:12.550 --> 02:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
as the Broadband initiatives um is that
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
being is that Broadband exp expansion
 
02:47:20.429 --> 02:47:20.439 align:start position:0%
catalyzing any program initiatives to
 
02:47:23.230 --> 02:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
attract businesses maybe remote workers
 
02:47:25.870 --> 02:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
to the North Country uh or is it just
 
02:47:27.710 --> 02:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
being really seen as okay we're going to
 
02:47:30.030 --> 02:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
expand Broadband but are we using that
 
02:47:32.590 --> 02:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
as a springboard absolutely I mean and
 
02:47:34.590 --> 02:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
that is one of the best reasons why
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
having the Broadband program at baa
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
makes sense is because we are definitely
 
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
using that in all of our work to uh to
 
02:47:43.710 --> 02:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
attract Workforce and businesses to New
 
02:47:46.190 --> 02:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and now you have a lot of
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
communities in in rural New Hampshire
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
that have access to high-speed internet
 
02:47:53.429 --> 02:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
did that did not before and that's a
 
02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
fundamental disadvantage for those
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
communities when we're out talking to
 
02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
businesses or Workforce saying trying to
 
02:48:01.870 --> 02:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
you know say such and such a community
 
02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
in Coos County has um you know an
 
02:48:06.510 --> 02:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
industrial park but they have no access
 
02:48:08.269 --> 02:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
to high-speed internet I mean forget it
 
02:48:10.389 --> 02:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
no business is going to go there but now
 
02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:13.479 align:start position:0%
they do so that is opened up uh our
 
02:48:15.990 --> 02:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
ability to to include those facilities
 
02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
when we talk to businesses and to
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce for sure
 
02:48:21.309 --> 02:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:48:24.429 --> 02:48:24.439 align:start position:0%
MH I'm could you find out for me how
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
many um work hours you have in welcome
 
02:48:32.269 --> 02:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
centers weekly maybe and also how many
 
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
GSA hours you have weekly roughly yes uh
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
we can get that and it's a fluctuating
 
02:48:41.389 --> 02:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
number you for sure because that that
 
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
staff comes and goes and as seasonal
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
probably in some cases in some cases yes
 
02:48:49.110 --> 02:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so maybe like an average yeah
 
02:48:50.830 --> 02:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
annual average or something like that
 
02:48:52.349 --> 02:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative e would you be
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
interested also in like foot counts too
 
02:48:56.190 --> 02:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
maybe so you can see sure because that
 
02:48:58.950 --> 02:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
helps that helps me when I see you take
 
02:49:03.429 --> 02:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
um you take tick marks like a GSA does
 
02:49:06.990 --> 02:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
or do I take tick marks I mean you know
 
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
so a GSA every time they talk to
 
02:49:11.469 --> 02:49:11.479 align:start position:0%
somebody they make a they have a sheet
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
where they record I'm not I don't I
 
02:49:15.870 --> 02:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that for for sure well they
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
keep track count we have counters in the
 
02:49:21.269 --> 02:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
buildings yeah great all right thank you
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative evil well first of all
 
02:49:26.469 --> 02:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
iig ja is infrastructure investment and
 
02:49:30.229 --> 02:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
jobs act thank you ma'am I looked it up
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
um it's something worth noting I think
 
02:49:37.469 --> 02:49:37.479 align:start position:0%
anyway um could you give us a overview
 
02:49:42.590 --> 02:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
on arpa the upt uptake are we meeting
 
02:49:46.830 --> 02:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
deadlines Etc so I'll move from ba
 
02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
Taylor to gopher Taylor for that answer
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
um so so those of you that know I have
 
02:49:56.670 --> 02:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
also for the past four years been
 
02:49:58.349 --> 02:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
managing the governor's office for
 
02:50:00.349 --> 02:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
emergency relief and recovery so all the
 
02:50:02.469 --> 02:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
covid funds that flew came through the
 
02:50:05.309 --> 02:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
state under car's act in arpa as I know
 
02:50:06.750 --> 02:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
some of the members here are also on
 
02:50:08.429 --> 02:50:08.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and have heard me talk
 
02:50:11.349 --> 02:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
about that for a couple of years now um
 
02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
so as you as you probably know December
 
02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
31st 2024 was the obligation deadline so
 
02:50:19.950 --> 02:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
what that means under Federal parlance
 
02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
is that by that time we had to have all
 
02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
funds under contract so through Council
 
02:50:30.590 --> 02:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
you know as far as New Hampshire goes um
 
02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
that total under arpa that we had
 
02:50:35.710 --> 02:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
allocated under What's called the state
 
02:50:38.910 --> 02:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
and local fiscal Recovery Fund was
 
02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:40.670 align:start position:0%
and local fiscal Recovery Fund was
9946

02:50:40.670 --> 02:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
9946
 
02:50:44.429 --> 02:50:44.439 align:start position:0%
Million um when we got to that deadline
 
02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
of December 31st we had fully allocated
 
02:50:52.630 --> 02:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
all but about $2.8 million of that
 
02:50:55.269 --> 02:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
amount um and what we had done was set
 
02:50:57.710 --> 02:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
up what we refer to as a waterfall
 
02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
account so um Council had approved a
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
contract that allowed us to effectively
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
take any money that was left over and
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
say rather than put that at risk of
 
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
going back to the federal government we
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
put it into the uh the affordable
 
02:51:14.110 --> 02:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
housing trust fund at New Hampshire
 
02:51:16.190 --> 02:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
housing um so that's where that final
 
02:51:20.510 --> 02:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
$2.8 million went um but all those funds
 
02:51:24.349 --> 02:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years um uh are
 
02:51:27.070 --> 02:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
fully under contract uh and and again I
 
02:51:30.110 --> 02:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
would is is again I've said uh many
 
02:51:32.190 --> 02:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
times the the the sort of prime
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
directive we used when when allocating
 
02:51:36.630 --> 02:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
those funds and working with Council and
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee was in one-time
 
02:51:41.790 --> 02:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
investment so things like housing things
 
02:51:45.030 --> 02:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
like uh Broadband or uh you know the new
 
02:51:47.349 --> 02:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
fish hatchery that's being built and
 
02:51:49.469 --> 02:51:49.479 align:start position:0%
things like that were areas that we
 
02:51:52.110 --> 02:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
really heavily focused on now not to say
 
02:51:54.349 --> 02:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
that was a 100% there were obviously
 
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
covid costs that had to be addressed
 
02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
programmatically and supporting you know
 
02:51:59.790 --> 02:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
different types of Health Facilities
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities assisted living that
 
02:52:04.670 --> 02:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
kind of thing um but uh in terms of
 
02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
deadlines now we are in the window
 
02:52:10.030 --> 02:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
between obligation and expenditure so we
 
02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
have until December 31st
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
2026 to fully expend all of those funds
 
02:52:17.429 --> 02:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
that are currently under contract so
 
02:52:21.389 --> 02:52:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:24.269 --> 02:52:24.279 align:start position:0%
now so I wasn't going to ask this but it
 
02:52:26.110 --> 02:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
just joged something in my mind so a lot
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the discussion of the budget um and
 
02:52:31.550 --> 02:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
you know the decrease in revenues we've
 
02:52:34.190 --> 02:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about Federal money going
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
away but what you just said is a lot of
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
the federal money had been used for
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
one-time expenditures for and I mean my
 
02:52:44.990 --> 02:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
recollection was it was primarily a
 
02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
focus on infrastructure type yes
 
02:52:50.349 --> 02:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
Investments so it's not like the money
 
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
going away was already funding operating
 
02:52:55.150 --> 02:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
right costs and and we were very
 
02:52:56.550 --> 02:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the fact that we didn't
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
want to create any new ongoing
 
02:53:02.349 --> 02:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
obligations on behalf of the state um
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
for programs that did not previously
 
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
exist I think we would definitely see um
 
02:53:12.269 --> 02:53:12.279 align:start position:0%
probably within some of the nonprofit
 
02:53:14.349 --> 02:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
organizations that do manage some
 
02:53:16.110 --> 02:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
programs and maybe they use some of that
 
02:53:18.510 --> 02:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
for those programs that they're going to
 
02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
need to be able to adapt to that but
 
02:53:22.469 --> 02:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
they went into that with their eyes wide
 
02:53:24.190 --> 02:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
open to the fact that this was not going
 
02:53:25.990 --> 02:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be funds that that were going to be
 
02:53:28.229 --> 02:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
continued so that was very clear I'm not
 
02:53:30.670 --> 02:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
sure we got it in the contracts per se
 
02:53:32.950 --> 02:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
but in all of our interactions with
 
02:53:35.710 --> 02:53:35.720 align:start position:0%
those organizations it was made very
 
02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
clear that you know you're going to have
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
to figure out what to do when we get to
 
02:53:40.870 --> 02:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
the end of these funds thanks I think
 
02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's a really important Point um so my
 
02:53:45.870 --> 02:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
only other question is could you just
 
02:53:48.870 --> 02:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about your Fe feeling
 
02:53:52.550 --> 02:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
on the um efficacy of the and and how
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's functioning on the invest New
 
02:53:57.150 --> 02:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and housing Champion programs
 
02:54:00.469 --> 02:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
the Housing Programs so the the the
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
federal funding that we used was um the
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
one almost hund million that was
 
02:54:08.309 --> 02:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
basically split into two buckets of
 
02:54:11.550 --> 02:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
funds one was for um what I call like
 
02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
trying to get ongoing projects for
 
02:54:17.070 --> 02:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
multifam rental units around the state
 
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
of all sizes online line as quick as we
 
02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
could get them so we were basically Gap
 
02:54:24.030 --> 02:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
funding um um a bunch of pro I think it
 
02:54:26.990 --> 02:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
was around 30 Pro projects with those
 
02:54:29.389 --> 02:54:29.399 align:start position:0%
funds and that those have almost
 
02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
exclusively all been completed um the
 
02:54:35.630 --> 02:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
other funding was used to help um
 
02:54:38.269 --> 02:54:38.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities work through the process
 
02:54:41.790 --> 02:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
of U establishing or considering
 
02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
affordable housing through programs like
 
02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
our demolition uh program that was used
 
02:54:50.309 --> 02:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
to help um you know open up space that
 
02:54:53.150 --> 02:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
on properties that have just fallen into
 
02:54:57.870 --> 02:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
disrepair um uh or um helping maybe like
 
02:55:00.190 --> 02:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
an Old Mill building get cleared out so
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
that that could be converted into
 
02:55:05.550 --> 02:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
housing um that program was was very
 
02:55:08.510 --> 02:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
successful and has now completed uh we
 
02:55:12.750 --> 02:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
had a per unit program where for for um
 
02:55:14.510 --> 02:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
for municipalities that permitted
 
02:55:17.110 --> 02:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing within a 60-day
 
02:55:19.950 --> 02:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
window uh they became eligible for a
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per unit grant for them to use
 
02:55:26.030 --> 02:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
effectively however they wanted so some
 
02:55:28.269 --> 02:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
towns maybe put it into a rainy day fund
 
02:55:30.910 --> 02:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
some towns put it into uh the project
 
02:55:32.590 --> 02:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
itself you they turned it back in and
 
02:55:35.469 --> 02:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
sort of lowered the cost even more um
 
02:55:38.429 --> 02:55:38.439 align:start position:0%
and then that program was again very
 
02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
successful um and then uh um and then
 
02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
our housing opportunities program which
 
02:55:47.150 --> 02:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
gave grants to municipalities that were
 
02:55:48.990 --> 02:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
interested in EXP exploring if we were
 
02:55:50.590 --> 02:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
going to do affordable housing how would
 
02:55:53.429 --> 02:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
we do that um kind of on their terms
 
02:55:54.950 --> 02:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
there was never any like you have to do
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
these three things so and then the
 
02:56:00.830 --> 02:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislature uh two years ago passed the
 
02:56:02.710 --> 02:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
housing Champions program which became
 
02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
kind of an evolution of the second half
 
02:56:06.590 --> 02:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know the work with our
 
02:56:08.670 --> 02:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities so this is an opportunity
 
02:56:11.950 --> 02:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
for communities uh to effectively raise
 
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
their hand and say you know we're going
 
02:56:15.990 --> 02:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
to be part of this and to in order to
 
02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
achieve this we're going to demonstrate
 
02:56:20.590 --> 02:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
that we're using all uh eligible State
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
programs like 79e or different tax
 
02:56:25.950 --> 02:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
credit programs uh that we have planning
 
02:56:29.070 --> 02:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
staff that has and planning members that
 
02:56:31.309 --> 02:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh are willing to get to have some
 
02:56:33.269 --> 02:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
training and what how zoning and
 
02:56:36.429 --> 02:56:36.439 align:start position:0%
planning affects their community and how
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
um you know affordable housing how
 
02:56:41.630 --> 02:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
that's financed and how a community can
 
02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
become part of that equation um so we
 
02:56:46.670 --> 02:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
just had an announcement I think right
 
02:56:48.469 --> 02:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
before Christmas where we announced the
 
02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
first 18 communities that achieved that
 
02:56:53.630 --> 02:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
housing Champions designation from all
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
over the state and as a result those
 
02:56:58.110 --> 02:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
those communities are now eligible for
 
02:57:01.550 --> 02:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
$5 million pot of funding for
 
02:57:04.750 --> 02:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um funding uh through an
 
02:57:06.590 --> 02:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
application process that we just barely
 
02:57:09.870 --> 02:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
launched I think last week so um that's
 
02:57:12.389 --> 02:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
how housing Champions Works um we're
 
02:57:13.990 --> 02:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
going to have another round in the
 
02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
spring for for uh additional communities
 
02:57:19.190 --> 02:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
to uh apply for the
 
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
designation um and then we'll sort of
 
02:57:23.830 --> 02:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
see how the the budget goes along and
 
02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
whether there'll be resources that'll be
 
02:57:28.550 --> 02:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
tied to that on the back end because I'm
 
02:57:30.550 --> 02:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
pretty sure anyone who does affordable
 
02:57:31.710 --> 02:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
housing development around here knows
 
02:57:34.550 --> 02:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
that $5 million isn't G to last that
 
02:57:36.750 --> 02:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
long in this environment so under
 
02:57:39.229 --> 02:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
housing Champions you can use the funds
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure improvements yes oh
 
02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
great because that's a challenge for a
 
02:57:46.990 --> 02:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
lot of them um have you included more
 
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
funding for these programs in your
 
02:57:51.269 --> 02:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
budget requests not in the budget
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
requests but I'm whereare there are
 
02:57:55.510 --> 02:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
bills in the legislature to to look at
 
02:58:00.429 --> 02:58:00.439 align:start position:0%
that thank you so um Miss Frederickson I
 
02:58:03.750 --> 02:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
think quoted this um idea that that
 
02:58:05.630 --> 02:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
department of travel and tourism
 
02:58:08.750 --> 02:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
spending has a 17 to1 return on
 
02:58:11.030 --> 02:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
investment I assume that comes from some
 
02:58:13.870 --> 02:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
kind of academic study yes could I get a
 
02:58:15.950 --> 02:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
copy absolutely I'd be happy to send it
 
02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
to you thank you and do you do any kind
 
02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
of annual report that has um an income
 
02:58:26.269 --> 02:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
statement and a and a balance sheet for
 
02:58:28.349 --> 02:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
your various
 
02:58:30.510 --> 02:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
programs just for travel tourism or for
 
02:58:32.229 --> 02:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
the Department for the whole department
 
02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we we filed a report I wrong about
 
02:58:38.950 --> 02:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:46.510 --> 02:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
do oh I'll get you one okay and um great
 
02:58:51.910 --> 02:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
so I have a I have I asked um LBA for um
 
02:58:55.469 --> 02:58:55.479 align:start position:0%
comparison of fiscal year 2019 and
 
02:58:56.910 --> 02:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
02:59:00.830 --> 02:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
2025 so roughly avoiding covid but kind
 
02:59:03.590 --> 02:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
of where were we then and now and your
 
02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
department um alog together is uh using
 
02:59:13.710 --> 02:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2025 is 53% more General
 
02:59:18.110 --> 02:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
funds than it was in 2019 so 2019 was
 
02:59:22.429 --> 02:59:22.439 align:start position:0%
11.8 million to today it's 18 million
 
02:59:25.469 --> 02:59:25.479 align:start position:0%
and that's quite a bit higher than than
 
02:59:28.309 --> 02:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
the Statewide average which is more like
 
02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
33% and so is that mostly the welcome
 
02:59:34.630 --> 02:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
centers moving from Highway funds to
 
02:59:36.349 --> 02:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
General funds or is there other things
 
02:59:38.590 --> 02:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
going on it would be that it would also
 
02:59:40.110 --> 02:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
be the addition of the office of
 
02:59:42.990 --> 02:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
Planning and Development so when if you
 
02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
recall when a couple of years ago when
 
02:59:46.510 --> 02:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
they established the department of
 
02:59:50.030 --> 02:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
energy um they took what was previously
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives which
 
02:59:53.429 --> 02:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
many of us remember is the office of
 
02:59:55.070 --> 02:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
State planning or the office of energy
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
and planning um and they dismantled that
 
03:00:01.269 --> 03:00:01.279 align:start position:0%
some of it went to energy the planning
 
03:00:03.510 --> 03:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
functions came to our department so that
 
03:00:06.950 --> 03:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
happened after 20 after covid so I think
 
03:00:09.990 --> 03:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
that was 2022 that occurred so that
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
would also probably explain that is that
 
03:00:14.110 --> 03:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
Regional planning gets funded that way
 
03:00:16.870 --> 03:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
or not in a very small way it's a small
 
03:00:19.309 --> 03:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
amount of money I think it's about
 
03:00:23.070 --> 03:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
$155,000 that goes to um goes to the
 
03:00:25.229 --> 03:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions so what is
 
03:00:27.990 --> 03:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
it mostly then
 
03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
staff I meant so the department of
 
03:00:33.710 --> 03:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
planning what is oh so we have a staff
 
03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
there we managed that for example the
 
03:00:39.510 --> 03:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
federal uh flood plane program uh we uh
 
03:00:42.630 --> 03:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
we Monitor and and work with
 
03:00:45.630 --> 03:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities on all uh Municipal
 
03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
planning and zoning regulations
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh and uh assist in projects that either
 
03:00:53.190 --> 03:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
our department or other departments that
 
03:00:55.950 --> 03:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
are that are doing we manage the uh the
 
03:00:58.790 --> 03:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
cord which is a a group of agencies that
 
03:01:03.150 --> 03:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
manage a surplus property um a couple of
 
03:01:04.429 --> 03:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
the things but those are the main
 
03:01:07.070 --> 03:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
functions I think of that of that office
 
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank all right representative Ms thank
 
03:01:11.550 --> 03:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and we're getting toward
 
03:01:15.309 --> 03:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
the end um I want to just before I ask
 
03:01:16.990 --> 03:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
the question I want to apologize to my
 
03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
colleagues because I'm going to ask
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
questions that I've already asked of
 
03:01:24.830 --> 03:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
another um Department um so bear with me
 
03:01:28.150 --> 03:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
um the um the headcount that you
 
03:01:29.630 --> 03:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
currently have and that you're
 
03:01:33.349 --> 03:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
requesting in in um in
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
2025 um does that give you the all of
 
03:01:39.269 --> 03:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
the resources that you need to
 
03:01:41.030 --> 03:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
accomplish everything that the
 
03:01:43.070 --> 03:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
legislature over the years is put in
 
03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:54.070 --> 03:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
um I would say that where that starts to
 
03:01:56.790 --> 03:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
stretch is in the welcome centers you
 
03:02:01.710 --> 03:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
know we are um required to uh manage the
 
03:02:05.950 --> 03:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
12 welcome centers um with um mostly
 
03:02:09.389 --> 03:02:09.399 align:start position:0%
part-time and some full-time staff um we
 
03:02:12.830 --> 03:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
honestly struggle with um how we perform
 
03:02:14.590 --> 03:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance at those facilities whether
 
03:02:16.349 --> 03:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
that's done through a third party or
 
03:02:19.590 --> 03:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
whether that's done um by our own staff
 
03:02:22.110 --> 03:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
um that fluctuates based on staff
 
03:02:26.190 --> 03:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
availability um other things like um you
 
03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:27.190 align:start position:0%
availability um other things like um you
know

03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:02:31.349 --> 03:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
um um the we have to use a sort of a
 
03:02:34.550 --> 03:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
portable bathroom solution for hours
 
03:02:37.510 --> 03:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
that the facilities are not open and
 
03:02:40.590 --> 03:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
that depends on a third party to
 
03:02:42.269 --> 03:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
maintain those
 
03:02:46.030 --> 03:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
facilities um I would also say that this
 
03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
is a staff um um that is well some
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
part-time some full-time staff um they
 
03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
deal with a lot of stuff there's
 
03:02:57.950 --> 03:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
homelessness that shows up uh in our
 
03:03:00.790 --> 03:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
facilities um we've had a story of at
 
03:03:02.550 --> 03:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
least one Center where a couple years
 
03:03:05.469 --> 03:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
ago where um the septic came to get
 
03:03:08.830 --> 03:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
pumped and the top foot was syringes of
 
03:03:11.830 --> 03:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
people that are doing bad things in the
 
03:03:16.309 --> 03:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
bathrooms um uh and so you know things
 
03:03:18.030 --> 03:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
we also have training on things like
 
03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
trafficking and Naran use and that kind
 
03:03:22.349 --> 03:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
of thing and these are in a lot of cases
 
03:03:23.870 --> 03:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
you know people that are retired that
 
03:03:25.309 --> 03:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
are sitting in these
 
03:03:28.790 --> 03:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
jobs um and so maintaining that that
 
03:03:31.990 --> 03:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
staff can be difficult so it's really
 
03:03:34.830 --> 03:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
more of that than anything else but I
 
03:03:37.229 --> 03:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
think if you ask me are we meeting the
 
03:03:39.269 --> 03:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements of my department
 
03:03:41.590 --> 03:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
with our staff yes but that probably one
 
03:03:44.190 --> 03:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
exception would be where we cut cut it
 
03:03:46.830 --> 03:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
close and then um just kind of the flip
 
03:03:50.070 --> 03:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
side of that are there are there things
 
03:03:50.080 --> 03:03:51.030 align:start position:0%
side of that are there are there things
in

03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:03:54.190 --> 03:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
statute that um really don't make sense
 
03:03:57.150 --> 03:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
anymore um you know either you know
 
03:04:01.469 --> 03:04:01.479 align:start position:0%
outdated um responsibilities or reports
 
03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
that you know you have to generate that
 
03:04:05.750 --> 03:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
quite frankly nobody looks
 
03:04:09.510 --> 03:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
at I would say um so when this
 
03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
department was established in
 
03:04:15.030 --> 03:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
2017 and we brought over the two the two
 
03:04:16.990 --> 03:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
P main divisions Economic Development
 
03:04:19.070 --> 03:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
and travel touris ISM we went through
 
03:04:22.229 --> 03:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
that exercise at that time um there were
 
03:04:25.710 --> 03:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
something like 12 commissions that um
 
03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
were being managed by dread previously
 
03:04:32.590 --> 03:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
that we eliminated when we um
 
03:04:36.110 --> 03:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
established Bea um in the seven years
 
03:04:37.710 --> 03:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
I've been in this job I've never had
 
03:04:39.269 --> 03:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
anyone call and say hey what happened to
 
03:04:41.710 --> 03:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
that awesome commission we used to be on
 
03:04:44.309 --> 03:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
so and they and they had all expired in
 
03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
one form or another so um I think we
 
03:04:50.070 --> 03:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
performed that and my goal has been to
 
03:04:51.710 --> 03:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
manage a department that doesn't have
 
03:04:53.670 --> 03:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
any of that going on so there might be
 
03:04:55.469 --> 03:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
one or two instances that Kathy hasn't
 
03:04:57.070 --> 03:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me but for the most part I
 
03:05:00.349 --> 03:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
think we're pretty clean on that
 
03:05:03.990 --> 03:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
front simil similarly are there
 
03:05:06.550 --> 03:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions that you are
 
03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
required to be on that maybe we
 
03:05:10.590 --> 03:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't because our speaker wants us
 
03:05:12.190 --> 03:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
to get rid of as much of that kind of
 
03:05:13.830 --> 03:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
stuff I could certainly give you a list
 
03:05:16.030 --> 03:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
of those U representative I can't
 
03:05:17.870 --> 03:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
remember them all off my head but yeah
 
03:05:19.309 --> 03:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
there there are some obviously that are
 
03:05:21.269 --> 03:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
really important but there are others
 
03:05:24.229 --> 03:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
that I'm like why are we on that um and
 
03:05:27.150 --> 03:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
I could please do I will do that and and
 
03:05:29.469 --> 03:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
H for LBA do we have any performance
 
03:05:31.830 --> 03:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
audit for this department that we could
 
03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
look for yeah I can take a look and see
 
03:05:36.510 --> 03:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
when's the last time if we've had one it
 
03:05:39.550 --> 03:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
was uh before the last bium as I recall
 
03:05:40.910 --> 03:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
but I'll take a look and I can email
 
03:05:42.389 --> 03:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
that to the thank you all right what one
 
03:05:44.429 --> 03:05:44.439 align:start position:0%
last one that represents Sweeny thank
 
03:05:45.590 --> 03:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you commissioner
 
03:05:47.349 --> 03:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
for being here circling back to the
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
welcome centers and it might be a DOT
 
03:05:51.269 --> 03:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
question based off your answer to
 
03:05:53.429 --> 03:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative rung but in the areas
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
where it makes sense have we thought
 
03:05:58.110 --> 03:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
about inviting commercial Enterprise to
 
03:06:00.630 --> 03:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
them where it might help with the
 
03:06:03.950 --> 03:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
Welcome Center maintenance yes um we
 
03:06:08.750 --> 03:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
have and there are challenges to that
 
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
because and don't I I don't want to
 
03:06:18.429 --> 03:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
interpret dot policy but
 
03:06:20.030 --> 03:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
the the welcome centers that are on the
 
03:06:22.870 --> 03:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
interstate so like Canterbury and those
 
03:06:26.990 --> 03:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
S Salem um they are under different set
 
03:06:28.590 --> 03:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
of rules than those that are on
 
03:06:30.830 --> 03:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
turnpikes so that's why we have the
 
03:06:33.309 --> 03:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
really nice ones in hookit and the ones
 
03:06:35.830 --> 03:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
in Salem OR in the North country are
 
03:06:37.630 --> 03:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
sort of just like off the side of the
 
03:06:41.910 --> 03:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
road kind of thing so Congress has
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
prohibited the ability to sell things
 
03:06:48.790 --> 03:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
there to offset the cost or uh to have
 
03:06:51.630 --> 03:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
um anyone other than State sort of
 
03:06:54.550 --> 03:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
manage those so we've tried to wiggle
 
03:06:56.550 --> 03:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
our way through those regulations and
 
03:06:58.670 --> 03:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
we've talked with Chambers particularly
 
03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
with the one in inil but the only way we
 
03:07:02.349 --> 03:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
would be able to do that would be to
 
03:07:05.469 --> 03:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
completely um um dispose of the property
 
03:07:07.790 --> 03:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
and and let someone else have it not
 
03:07:11.070 --> 03:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
that that hasn't also been discussed um
 
03:07:13.349 --> 03:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
but the the Welcome Center issue is
 
03:07:16.429 --> 03:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
certainly one um there's probably some
 
03:07:17.870 --> 03:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
other Solutions out there there but
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
given the constraints that we have we
 
03:07:21.990 --> 03:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
operate kind of consistently in in the
 
03:07:23.830 --> 03:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
box that we're
 
03:07:26.349 --> 03:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
in all right thank you for both for
 
03:07:30.150 --> 03:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
coming and um we will be uh in recess
 
03:07:32.229 --> 03:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
until uh
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%

and although we are a large agency only
 
04:18:43.950 --> 04:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
17% of our funding comes from the
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
general fund approximately $1 million
 
04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
each year for the next two fiscal
 
04:18:53.349 --> 04:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
years the challenge we face and one we
 
04:18:55.469 --> 04:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
Embrace is how to make every dollar of
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
this funding work as hard as possible
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
for New
 
04:19:01.109 --> 04:19:01.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the dncr is responsible for
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
managing more than 220,000 Acres of
 
04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
public land 870 buildings and an array
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
of critical infrastructure our team of
 
04:19:12.349 --> 04:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
nearly a thousand employees maintains
 
04:19:14.910 --> 04:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
everything from fire towers and dams to
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
septic systems and hundreds of miles of
 
04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
roads and snowmobile trails which are
 
04:19:21.030 --> 04:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
vital to New Hampshire's outdoor
 
04:19:24.309 --> 04:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
recreation economy this is a substantial
 
04:19:26.189 --> 04:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
portfolio and I am proud to say that our
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
team meets these responsibilities with
 
04:19:31.790 --> 04:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
resourcefulness commitment and
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
efficiency one area where the dncr
 
04:19:37.149 --> 04:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
shines is in our Revenue generation New
 
04:19:38.910 --> 04:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state parks for instance has
 
04:19:40.990 --> 04:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
become one of the most efficient Park
 
04:19:43.229 --> 04:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
systems in the country through
 
04:19:45.429 --> 04:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
Innovation and a commitment to
 
04:19:47.870 --> 04:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency we fully fund park
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
operations from the fees that we collect
 
04:19:53.590 --> 04:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
we also then reinvest this Revenue in
 
04:19:55.790 --> 04:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
other initiatives that benefit the state
 
04:19:57.870 --> 04:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
from Federal grant Administration like
 
04:20:00.389 --> 04:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
the land and water conservation fund and
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
other admin and business functions to
 
04:20:05.149 --> 04:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
the preservation of unique Scenic
 
04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
scientific historical recreational and
 
04:20:10.349 --> 04:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
natural areas throughout the state this
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
model not only saves taxpayer dollars
 
04:20:14.950 --> 04:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
but also enables us to maintain and
 
04:20:18.269 --> 04:20:18.279 align:start position:0%
expand Services despite limited State
 
04:20:20.670 --> 04:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
funding our division of forest and lands
 
04:20:23.109 --> 04:20:23.119 align:start position:0%
is another example of resourcefulness
 
04:20:25.149 --> 04:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting and Nursery sales
 
04:20:27.870 --> 04:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
generate vital Revenue that fund many of
 
04:20:31.229 --> 04:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
our staff public programs and services
 
04:20:34.109 --> 04:20:34.119 align:start position:0%
demand for seedlings remains robust
 
04:20:36.790 --> 04:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
despite recent weather challenges which
 
04:20:39.590 --> 04:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
is why we invested arpa money into a new
 
04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
irrigation system and a large cooler to
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
ensure future Revenue
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
stability at the dncr we make the most
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
of what we receive from the general fund
 
04:20:52.109 --> 04:20:52.119 align:start position:0%
by leveraging nearly 4 million of the $1
 
04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
million we are seeking we will generate
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
Federal match dollars necessary to
 
04:20:59.109 --> 04:20:59.119 align:start position:0%
maintain our budget's impact in the
 
04:21:01.149 --> 04:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
cultural resources divisions we
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
strategically use the 4.2 million
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
allocated from the general fund to
 
04:21:09.109 --> 04:21:09.119 align:start position:0%
maximize Federal matches with up to 80%
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
or 3.3 million going towards these
 
04:21:14.109 --> 04:21:14.119 align:start position:0%
matches this helps us provide more grant
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
opportunities across New Hampshire
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%

Generations I just read uh a bit of my
 
04:22:24.030 --> 04:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
remarks that were submitted in November
 
04:22:27.630 --> 04:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
which was our budget um submission uh
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
per Governor sununu at the time I've
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
included that copy in your folder and at
 
04:22:35.630 --> 04:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
this time I thought I'd let my division
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
directors introduce themselves and give
 
04:22:40.990 --> 04:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
you a snapshot of the programs that they
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
Wilson good afternoon everyone I'm Brian
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
Wilson director of division of Parks and
 
04:22:56.469 --> 04:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
Recreation um within your handouts uh
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
that you have your packet there's a
 
04:23:01.389 --> 04:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
couple um uh color Flyers uh for
 
04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
reference um as the uh just to kind of
 
04:23:05.109 --> 04:23:05.119 align:start position:0%
reiterate a few things that the
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner said uh the mission of the
 
04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
depart uh division of Parks and
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%

citizens and guests without standing
 
04:23:16.389 --> 04:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
recreational uh ex educational and uh
 
04:23:18.309 --> 04:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
inspirational experiences through
 
04:23:20.710 --> 04:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
responsible management and Cooperative

stewardship of the state's natural
 
04:23:25.070 --> 04:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
Recreation and cultural resources uh we
 
04:23:26.750 --> 04:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
often like to think we're in the
 
04:23:29.109 --> 04:23:29.119 align:start position:0%
business of making magic happen uh and
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
on on the public
 
04:23:30.560 --> 04:23:32.349 align:start position:0%
on on the public
lands

04:23:32.349 --> 04:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
lands
 
04:23:35.990 --> 04:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire state parks is um one
 
04:23:39.030 --> 04:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
of the most efficient Run Park systems
 
04:23:41.550 --> 04:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
in the country according to the National
 
04:23:43.030 --> 04:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
Association of State Park Park directors
 
04:23:45.550 --> 04:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
we are only one of two states uh South
 
04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
Carolina being the other state that is
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
entirely uh managed through their
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
operating fund dollar so no other
 
04:23:54.149 --> 04:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
sources of funding uh to run the
 
04:23:55.550 --> 04:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
operation and New Hampshire was the
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
first to do that uh and has continued to
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
do that um and we've been able to grow
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
and expand on that model as well too um
 
04:24:08.189 --> 04:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
we are very Enterprise minded um some of
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers that uh that I have here to
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
to share with you are just kind of our
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
some of our statistics from
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
2024 um close to 3 million visitors that
 
04:24:19.710 --> 04:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
we've captured as far as recorded
 
04:24:22.269 --> 04:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
visitation at many of our lands uh that
 
04:24:24.630 --> 04:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
that is only probably about half of the
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
visitors many of our places that are
 
04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
unstaffed um uh where we're not uh doing
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
estimate counts or or head counts uh we
 
04:24:33.910 --> 04:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
we don't uh account for that traffic as
 
04:24:36.349 --> 04:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
well too uh but just to give a little uh
 
04:24:38.469 --> 04:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
size of the scale of of visitation that
 
04:24:41.349 --> 04:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
we have um we have many campgrounds
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
um over 1300 campsites um our occupancy
 
04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
rate uh was
 
04:24:51.910 --> 04:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
86% um over the course of the season so
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
very very popular most of our weekends
 
04:24:59.710 --> 04:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
occupancy was in 99 uh 99% uh full um
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
and uh we we've been trying to do things
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
where we're taking primitive sites and
 
04:25:07.429 --> 04:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
um upgrading them to more higher
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
experience a lot of the projects that we
 
04:25:11.349 --> 04:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
were doing with the federal dollarss the
 
04:25:13.510 --> 04:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
arpa funds were to to uh improve
 
04:25:15.870 --> 04:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure whether that's utilities
 
04:25:19.990 --> 04:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
Power Water uh uh and and electric to a
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of those uh
 
04:25:25.830 --> 04:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
campgrounds um 36% of uh camping
 
04:25:28.109 --> 04:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
occupancy is New Hampshire residents so
 
04:25:29.790 --> 04:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of the F most of the folks that
 
04:25:31.750 --> 04:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
are coming uh enjoying our campgrounds
 
04:25:34.149 --> 04:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
are are traveling from out of state and
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to more of that a in a minute
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we also do um
 
04:25:41.630 --> 04:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
is a lot of programming as well too so
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's Environ Al and educational
 
04:25:45.830 --> 04:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
programs we uh facilitate a lot of that
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves through our staff um and uh
 
04:25:50.950 --> 04:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
through Partners as well too um like the
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
student Conservation Association uh runs
 
04:25:55.590 --> 04:25:55.600 align:start position:0%

04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
where we have um uh interactions with
 
04:26:00.109 --> 04:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of kids and
 
04:26:01.750 --> 04:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
families over the course of the Season
 
04:26:03.630 --> 04:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
where the staff are embedded throughout
 
04:26:06.149 --> 04:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
the park system to provide programming
 
04:26:07.990 --> 04:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh we also work very closely with many
 
04:26:09.550 --> 04:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
of our other partners like the SEO
 
04:26:11.790 --> 04:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
Science Center in Ry at odan point or
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
the mount Washington weather Observatory
 
04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
who's doing more scientific uh research
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
and and education that uh couldn't
 
04:26:21.630 --> 04:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
happen in a in a different location than
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
than it does in the state
 
04:26:25.830 --> 04:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
park um one of our other programs is a
 
04:26:29.550 --> 04:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
special use permit program that U is uh
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
a permit program that happens anytime
 
04:26:32.670 --> 04:26:32.680 align:start position:0%

Mountain um we also administer several
 
04:27:47.429 --> 04:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
different Grant programs and um the the
 
04:27:48.830 --> 04:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
fees and revenues that come in through
 
04:27:52.030 --> 04:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
the park system help uh fund the the
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
staff that administer these programs uh
 
04:27:56.109 --> 04:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
some of them include the land and water
 
04:27:57.870 --> 04:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
conservation fund which is funding
 
04:27:59.469 --> 04:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
through the National Park Service that
 
04:28:02.349 --> 04:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
goes both to State Park projects but
 
04:28:04.670 --> 04:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
also to local municipalities uh through
 
04:28:06.990 --> 04:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
a competitive Grant process and then our
 
04:28:10.109 --> 04:28:10.119 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Trails um administers a few uh
 
04:28:12.109 --> 04:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
different programs a gr and a program
 
04:28:15.790 --> 04:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
for motorized snowmobile and ohrv uh
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
programs as well as a federal Recreation
 
04:28:21.550 --> 04:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
uh Rec Trail program all combined in
 
04:28:25.269 --> 04:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
2024 we issued over almost $1 million in
 
04:28:28.469 --> 04:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
in grant funding externally to to the
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
agency um through that it's working with
 
04:28:34.030 --> 04:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh that that was 207 different Community
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
groups organizations or municipalities
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
that received funding so we like to
 
04:28:40.030 --> 04:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
think of ourselves as having you know a
 
04:28:42.670 --> 04:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
niche or embedded in uh a part ship with
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
virtually every community in in across
 
04:28:44.880 --> 04:28:45.630 align:start position:0%
virtually every community in in across
the

04:28:45.630 --> 04:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
state um outdoor recreation contributes
 
04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
3.9 billion to the an economic impact in
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we feel that we are the
 
04:28:56.469 --> 04:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
destination that people are coming to
 
04:28:58.109 --> 04:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
when when they're visiting uh New
 
04:28:59.710 --> 04:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh they're they're they're
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
coming to frankco not State Park they're
 
04:29:03.550 --> 04:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
coming to Hampton Beach they're coming
 
04:29:05.149 --> 04:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
to mount manad they're coming to Mount
 
04:29:07.229 --> 04:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
Washington and all of our other little
 
04:29:09.750 --> 04:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
spectacular places uh across the state
 
04:29:13.349 --> 04:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
as well um one last just to to is uh
 
04:29:15.550 --> 04:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
Frank on not State Park uh this year we
 
04:29:17.630 --> 04:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
reported uh visitation from all 50
 
04:29:19.750 --> 04:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
states in 68 different countries from
 
04:29:22.269 --> 04:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
around the world um and that's just at
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
that at that one Park location so um
 
04:29:26.990 --> 04:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's just some some of the highlights
 
04:29:29.469 --> 04:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
I can get into some of our our funding
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
um if you like or yep yeah I'd like to
 
04:29:36.189 --> 04:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
ask uh on those special events the 340
 
04:29:38.510 --> 04:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
special events for uh industry
 
04:29:40.149 --> 04:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
organizations what what do you typically
 
04:29:43.229 --> 04:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
charge for the permits um it is it is
 
04:29:46.349 --> 04:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
relatively small
 
04:29:48.990 --> 04:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh okay sorry um so there there's a
 
04:29:51.109 --> 04:29:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's a $100 administrative processing
 
04:29:54.630 --> 04:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
fee for every application um and then we
 
04:29:57.550 --> 04:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
have a a structure for event size that's
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
usually in just a few hundred range and
 
04:30:02.510 --> 04:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
then if we start getting into larger
 
04:30:05.389 --> 04:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
impacts like uh displacement of parking
 
04:30:07.030 --> 04:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
or things like that like at at the Sea
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
Coast for instance where things like the
 
04:30:10.830 --> 04:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
seafood festival will displace General
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
parking we will run uh you know we will
 
04:30:14.910 --> 04:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
run metrics on that and make sure that
 
04:30:16.510 --> 04:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
you know the state is being made whole
 
04:30:19.149 --> 04:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
on that so generally almost all of those
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
are probably below
 
04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
$2,500 that the state's receiving for
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
all those permits um and the the the
 
04:30:28.229 --> 04:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
benefit though that the groups are
 
04:30:29.910 --> 04:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
getting uh through whether it's a
 
04:30:32.109 --> 04:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
fundraiser um like I think the uh
 
04:30:33.670 --> 04:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
Penguin Plunge which is a special
 
04:30:35.830 --> 04:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
Olympic uh event that happens at Hampton
 
04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
Beach they rais close to a million
 
04:30:39.550 --> 04:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
dollars um you know in their two-day
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
event uh so we you know the the parks
 
04:30:43.870 --> 04:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
our venue to really unlock that
 
04:30:47.109 --> 04:30:47.119 align:start position:0%
potential great thank you chairman uh
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:30:52.469 --> 04:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question um how much do you
 
04:30:54.070 --> 04:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
interact with the Department of travel
 
04:30:54.080 --> 04:30:54.950 align:start position:0%
interact with the Department of travel
and

04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:57.790 --> 04:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
tourism um we interact quite a bit um
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
with the the department of Bea really so
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's travel and tourism uh the uh
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
outdoor uh Recreation industry office as
 
04:31:09.389 --> 04:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
well too um so there's many different uh
 
04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
facets that we work on both in kind of
 
04:31:15.670 --> 04:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
cross uh marketing uh strategies um we
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
work with them relative to uh campaigns
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
on like visitor use management um we
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
work with Fish and Game closely as well
 
04:31:26.429 --> 04:31:26.439 align:start position:0%
on that so like the uh hike safe um
 
04:31:27.950 --> 04:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
there's a campaign going on right now
 
04:31:30.469 --> 04:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
called wildly responsible that Bea is
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
administering that we're at the table on
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
helping develop kind of campaign and
 
04:31:36.550 --> 04:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
messaging uh relative to you know
 
04:31:39.189 --> 04:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
responsible behavior safety and and
 
04:31:40.429 --> 04:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
other things and you know the best
 
04:31:44.469 --> 04:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
places to go to yeah and is the fact
 
04:31:48.030 --> 04:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
that um you said you're 99% full in the
 
04:31:50.109 --> 04:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
Parks is that an indication maybe you're
 
04:31:53.910 --> 04:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
not charging enough um great question so
 
04:31:55.870 --> 04:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
we did just recently in the last year so
 
04:31:57.870 --> 04:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
raise our Campground rates um that
 
04:31:59.309 --> 04:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
process goes through the the fiscal
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
committee for our for our fee approval
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
so we have been incrementally over the
 
04:32:07.109 --> 04:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
last two years um going uh kind of piece
 
04:32:10.349 --> 04:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
by piece through our fee package uh to
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
kind of review and and look at where we
 
04:32:15.269 --> 04:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
have the ability to increase fees so we
 
04:32:17.109 --> 04:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
did that we did do that for for camping
 
04:32:18.590 --> 04:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
and we're we're seeing the results of
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
that um our dayuse visitation is another
 
04:32:24.109 --> 04:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
area the next area where we're hoping to
 
04:32:27.389 --> 04:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
um uh tackle it that is extraordinarily
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
complex uh for us so it will it will
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
likely be you know a year-long process
 
04:32:33.389 --> 04:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
for us to because it goes all the way
 
04:32:35.590 --> 04:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
down to what happens at the toll booth
 
04:32:36.830 --> 04:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
when somebody's driving into the park
 
04:32:38.429 --> 04:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
where you come from Resident or
 
04:32:41.109 --> 04:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
non-resident considerations our point of
 
04:32:42.429 --> 04:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
sale system
 
04:32:45.070 --> 04:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
um and really all the whole back end
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
getting all that and then through a
 
04:32:50.790 --> 04:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal fiscal process as well
 
04:32:54.109 --> 04:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
eel I actually I was also going to ask
 
04:32:59.710 --> 04:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
about um cross marketing with the Bea
 
04:33:03.230 --> 04:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
but uh so your fee structure is
 
04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
statutorily set or how does that um
 
04:33:08.830 --> 04:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
statute allows for the commissioner to
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
propose fees uhu that are approved by
 
04:33:13.269 --> 04:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee so uh through our
 
04:33:16.109 --> 04:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
self-funded model um we have the ability
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
to make recommendations which the the
 
04:33:20.269 --> 04:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee would either accept
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
or not um to sustain that to sustain
 
04:33:26.429 --> 04:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
that model so over time we that's what
 
04:33:28.510 --> 04:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
we've been we come back to the fiscal
 
04:33:31.551 --> 04:33:31.561 align:start position:0%
committee periodically um as as needed
 
04:33:33.230 --> 04:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
probably the best example of like the
 
04:33:35.910 --> 04:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
most frequent is usually twice a year we
 
04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee to um
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
review and approve uh the fees for Canon
 
04:33:43.949 --> 04:33:43.959 align:start position:0%
Mountain whether it's the day use um day
 
04:33:46.470 --> 04:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
tickets and the season pass fees we we
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
we we break that up due to the kind of
 
04:33:51.269 --> 04:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
the seasonality of when people are um
 
04:33:53.230 --> 04:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
purchasing those things um so that
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
happens on a reoccurring basis um it's
 
04:33:58.830 --> 04:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
been a long time since the the dayuse
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
fees have been adjusted um so we've been
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
able to have really great growth um
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
without having to go to the fees yet but
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
we are definitely reaching the point now
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
where where where it's time and we've
 
04:34:12.429 --> 04:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
been working on that for for a couple
 
04:34:15.150 --> 04:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
years now and if I could just add per
 
04:34:17.949 --> 04:34:17.959 align:start position:0%
RSA um we are supposed to be in line
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
with the market sorry the sun is shining
 
04:34:24.150 --> 04:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
right on us right now yeah thank you um
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
and and so you know with especially with
 
04:34:29.949 --> 04:34:29.959 align:start position:0%
the the you know as a ski mountain um uh
 
04:34:31.830 --> 04:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
we work closely with all the other ski
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
mountains to promote New Hampshire and
 
04:34:36.510 --> 04:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
ski NH and um and so you know we don't
 
04:34:39.390 --> 04:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
want to be out of line dramatically with
 
04:34:41.709 --> 04:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
the other uh ski ski mountains because
 
04:34:43.470 --> 04:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
want to see them being successful as
 
04:34:45.709 --> 04:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
well um and so it's a thoughtful it's a
 
04:34:47.269 --> 04:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
thoughtful approach but our you know
 
04:34:49.470 --> 04:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
when this was deemed the the funding
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism it was clear in RSA that we
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
were supposed to be aware of of Market
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
considerations that's that's comforting
 
04:35:01.150 --> 04:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
actually um and so I remember during
 
04:35:03.390 --> 04:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
covid there was a lot of talk about the
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
very heavy use of our state parks and Ma
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance challenges um I realize
 
04:35:11.709 --> 04:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
you're doing a great job within the self
 
04:35:13.869 --> 04:35:13.879 align:start position:0%
funed model but how do you feel that
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
you're doing on maintenance of the parks
 
04:35:16.439 --> 04:35:17.109 align:start position:0%
you're doing on maintenance of the parks
would

04:35:17.109 --> 04:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:35:19.551 --> 04:35:19.561 align:start position:0%
you prefer you had a little more money
 
04:35:22.269 --> 04:35:22.279 align:start position:0%
to do and and I also as you know I came
 
04:35:24.029 --> 04:35:24.039 align:start position:0%
from Public Works we heard a lot about
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
your Capital infrastructure yeah no well
 
04:35:27.830 --> 04:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you because that was one last
 
04:35:29.629 --> 04:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
point I was hoping to make so thank you
 
04:35:32.510 --> 04:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
for uh for for that question um while
 
04:35:35.670 --> 04:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
the self-funded model Works uh has has
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
proven to work really well here in New
 
04:35:38.709 --> 04:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's really primarily
 
04:35:40.910 --> 04:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
because we have some great Park
 
04:35:43.070 --> 04:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
attractions to be able to really drive
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
the majority of that Revenue so that's
 
04:35:47.910 --> 04:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
The Flume Gorge that's the Sea Coast um
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
those those are the places that help
 
04:35:51.551 --> 04:35:51.561 align:start position:0%
support a lot of the smaller parks that
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
just are are not there intended to be a
 
04:35:58.029 --> 04:35:58.039 align:start position:0%
main Revenue Source the Madison Boulder
 
04:35:59.709 --> 04:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
you know there's nobody there collecting
 
04:36:01.990 --> 04:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
fees to to to come look at you know a
 
04:36:07.310 --> 04:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
big Glacier erratic Rock um but um where
 
04:36:10.590 --> 04:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
the vulnerability I think lies is the
 
04:36:13.150 --> 04:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
the states uh willingness to reinvest
 
04:36:17.629 --> 04:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
into the park system so uh generally
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
historically over time the capital
 
04:36:22.709 --> 04:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for state parks have been
 
04:36:26.670 --> 04:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
pretty uh small I I I think um the
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment in Hampton Beach State
 
04:36:30.510 --> 04:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
Park is is is the largest that has
 
04:36:31.990 --> 04:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
happened in the in the
 
04:36:36.070 --> 04:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
last 100 years probably um and I think
 
04:36:38.830 --> 04:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh just you know one look at um the you
 
04:36:40.349 --> 04:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
know the Ocean Boulevard down there and
 
04:36:41.949 --> 04:36:41.959 align:start position:0%
all the Redevelopment that is happened
 
04:36:44.269 --> 04:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
on the west side of the street that came
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
after the park put in the investment to
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
that I think speaks um volumes to what
 
04:36:52.510 --> 04:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
the possibilities are that could happen
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
um we were fortunate enough to get uh
 
04:36:57.551 --> 04:36:57.561 align:start position:0%
about $30 million from the the arpa
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
program to to put into park projects so
 
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
um we're we're doing a lot of great work
 
04:37:05.789 --> 04:37:05.799 align:start position:0%
uh right now but the that doesn't go
 
04:37:09.029 --> 04:37:09.039 align:start position:0%
very far um for instance we have a $4.5
 
04:37:11.629 --> 04:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
million project that is replacing uh
 
04:37:14.590 --> 04:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
five bathrooms at Puckaway State Park um
 
04:37:16.869 --> 04:37:16.879 align:start position:0%
a bath house renovation or a new
 
04:37:18.670 --> 04:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
bathroom building at a park is about a
 
04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
million dollars um so uh when we get $2
 
04:37:24.310 --> 04:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
million a year for a capital
 
04:37:25.949 --> 04:37:25.959 align:start position:0%
appropriation or something that that
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
that that is struggling um so that's
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
where um I try to to lean on is that
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
when when the state looks at the
 
04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities that uh of just
 
04:37:39.230 --> 04:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
maintaining the infrastructure that we
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
have at the park we're not really
 
04:37:43.109 --> 04:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
looking at expansion necessarily or
 
04:37:45.629 --> 04:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
additional acquisition uh those kinds of
 
04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
things it's really just trying to kind
 
04:37:49.390 --> 04:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
of maintain things that we have now such
 
04:37:52.990 --> 04:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
as an 85y old aerial Tramway um that we
 
04:37:55.310 --> 04:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
would like to see another 40 years uh
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
happen uh that is that is critical to uh
 
04:38:01.830 --> 04:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire's economy I think so
 
04:38:04.390 --> 04:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know if if that goes away so do you
 
04:38:06.429 --> 04:38:06.439 align:start position:0%
know the 100,000 visitors that rote it
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
each year um and you know I think the
 
04:38:11.070 --> 04:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
ripple effect through that would would
 
04:38:12.910 --> 04:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
be strongly felt throughout the region
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
so that's just a you know an example um
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
we have some parks Greenfield state park
 
04:38:20.189 --> 04:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
right now was closed for the last year
 
04:38:23.230 --> 04:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
because we're doing a long overdue um
 
04:38:25.949 --> 04:38:25.959 align:start position:0%
arpa projects there for for utilities so
 
04:38:28.830 --> 04:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
that Community I'm sure is feeling uh
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
some level of impact that um thousands
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
and thousands of campers and visitors
 
04:38:36.429 --> 04:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't coming to to the park
 
04:38:39.629 --> 04:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
anymore representative Ms thank thank
 
04:38:41.070 --> 04:38:41.080 align:start position:0%

04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner and director for coming in

04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to U thank you for all the
 
04:38:50.189 --> 04:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
work that um you have done and continue
 
04:38:52.269 --> 04:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
to do at Hampton Beach I mean I'm glad
 
04:38:54.269 --> 04:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
you brought up the uh
 
04:38:57.310 --> 04:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
improvements um they're spectacular and
 
04:38:59.869 --> 04:38:59.879 align:start position:0%
it it has led to a lot of uh development
 
04:39:01.590 --> 04:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
so thank thank you for your work you're
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
doing there and um you know the only
 
04:39:07.269 --> 04:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
other thing I would comment on is that
 
04:39:11.070 --> 04:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
um everybody is very thankful and um
 
04:39:14.189 --> 04:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
proud of the lifeguards uh at the beach
 
04:39:16.869 --> 04:39:16.879 align:start position:0%
and the work that they do um and I think
 
04:39:19.709 --> 04:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
they were ranked as the best they won
 
04:39:22.830 --> 04:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
some award is the more yeah thank you
 
04:39:24.990 --> 04:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
more we're going to need a whole another
 
04:39:27.189 --> 04:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
building just to house the trophies that
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
they continue to accumulate there um no
 
04:39:32.349 --> 04:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
um and that's a a stat that's on the
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
sheet here that I was remiss on on
 
04:39:37.310 --> 04:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
mentioning here so um this summer there
 
04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
was 166 ocean rescues 100 or 85 first
 
04:39:43.350 --> 04:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
and major medical incidents that that
 
04:39:44.830 --> 04:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
happened through that Squad they
 
04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
continue to um I think be one of you
 
04:39:50.350 --> 04:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
know the most professional um groups
 
04:39:52.350 --> 04:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
lifeguard groups uh on on the on the
 
04:39:54.990 --> 04:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
east coast and we continue to strive to
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
do that um they're probably out there
 
04:39:58.590 --> 04:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
swimming in their wet suits right now
 
04:40:01.830 --> 04:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
and training um and also on here um
 
04:40:03.550 --> 04:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
which also gets overlooked as well too
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
we had 42 Mountain rescues at Mount
 
04:40:08.070 --> 04:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
manad that our staff uh the park staff
 
04:40:10.670 --> 04:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
are involved in so we work closely with
 
04:40:12.628 --> 04:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
fishing game and other First Responders
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
but our staff in the park system are the
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
First Responders cuz we're there already
 
04:40:20.070 --> 04:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
when a lot of these things are happening
 
04:40:22.150 --> 04:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
and then also just uh you know thank you
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%

to uh local businesses and um I've been
 
04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
there for almost 30 years now and seen
 
04:40:38.190 --> 04:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
how it's grown and it's become uh quite
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
the event and yeah thanks for your help
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%

the best ones when I come to see you
 
04:41:04.430 --> 04:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
here at the
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
legislature yes um thank you for the
 
04:41:08.590 --> 04:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you my name is
 
04:41:10.270 --> 04:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
Patrick Hackley I'm the director for the
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
division of forest and
 
04:41:15.150 --> 04:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
um I've made sure that you have lots of
 
04:41:17.550 --> 04:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
reading material in my handout so I'll
 
04:41:19.110 --> 04:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
go through some of the metrics in that
 
04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
report and then I'm happy to take any
 
04:41:22.590 --> 04:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
questions you might
 
04:41:25.628 --> 04:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
have so our our division is we we're
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
basically the land managers for the
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
state um the state owns approximately
 
04:41:34.030 --> 04:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
220,000 Acres we manage about 170,000
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
Acres of just what what I would call
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
dncr reservations and those are

scattered Parcels across the state from
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
our 40,000 acre uh Nash stream tract up
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
in the North Country to U scattered
 
04:41:48.990 --> 04:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
small tracks uh we one of the largest
 
04:41:50.750 --> 04:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
state forest we have in the south is the
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
pisga state forest that's 13,000 Acres
 
04:41:56.070 --> 04:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
is 10,000 and then Puckaway I believe is
 
04:41:59.120 --> 04:42:00.788 align:start position:0%
is 10,000 and then Puckaway I believe is
around

04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:42:03.868 --> 04:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
5,000 so we have a modest staff about 52
 
04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
people uh and we are quite diverse
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
within the division of forest and lands
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
we're comprised of eight bureaus or
 
04:42:13.470 --> 04:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
units as it says in the in the report
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%

04:42:18.150 --> 04:42:18.160 align:start position:0%

04:42:23.628 --> 04:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
and Communications and there's a page
 
04:42:25.990 --> 04:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
for each one of those bureaus in this um
 
04:42:28.868 --> 04:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
small but meaty report I've given you um
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
and we also have a strategic partnership
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
with UNH Cooperative Extension unlike
 
04:42:35.788 --> 04:42:35.798 align:start position:0%
other states where they have um what
 
04:42:38.190 --> 04:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
they call service Foresters that provide
 
04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
uh free consultation to private land
 
04:42:42.310 --> 04:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
owners we don't have that in New
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we partner with our friends
 
04:42:46.708 --> 04:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
at UNH Cooperative Extension we actually
 
04:42:49.230 --> 04:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
provide them with some uh financial
 
04:42:51.948 --> 04:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
support to do Outreach and education to
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
the public and we also partner with them
 
04:42:56.470 --> 04:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
on a lot of workshops so they're kind of
 
04:42:56.480 --> 04:42:57.350 align:start position:0%
on a lot of workshops so they're kind of
our

04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
education uh Outreach arm our Foresters
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
do just that they do Forest management
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what they specifically uh are
 
04:43:09.390 --> 04:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
focused on um some of the just some of
 
04:43:10.910 --> 04:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
the highlights from this past fiscal
 
04:43:12.948 --> 04:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
year now this is the end of fiscal year
 
04:43:15.750 --> 04:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
2024 so that was of course at the end of
 
04:43:19.110 --> 04:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
um June uh We've we've managed on
 
04:43:21.550 --> 04:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
average about 2,000 acres a year this
 
04:43:23.550 --> 04:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
year is a little lower we we generate
 
04:43:27.030 --> 04:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
about $11.75 million in Timber Revenue
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
um we are working on a 5,000 acre Forest
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
Legacy project we partner with the US
 
04:43:35.310 --> 04:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
Forest Service they have a program
 
04:43:38.230 --> 04:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
called Forest Legacy and that allows us
 
04:43:40.310 --> 04:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
to purchase the development rights this
 
04:43:42.430 --> 04:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
is a willing Buy willing seller
 
04:43:44.510 --> 04:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
situation where they want to sell the
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
development rights um and this conserves
 
04:43:50.470 --> 04:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
land and conserves working Forest um and
 
04:43:52.350 --> 04:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
kind of contributes to that forested
 
04:43:53.868 --> 04:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
landscape we've all come to appreciate
 
04:43:56.708 --> 04:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um well our forest
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
Health uh when I call these bureaus they
 
04:44:00.868 --> 04:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
range anywhere from about 15 people to
 
04:44:02.550 --> 04:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
about three our smallest one's about
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
three people Forest Health is one of
 
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
those smaller um bureaus um but they
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
they're small But Mighty they do a lot
 
04:44:12.310 --> 04:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
of work they they conduct aerial surveys
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
across the state for uh insect and
 
04:44:17.550 --> 04:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
disease outbreaks um they do research
 
04:44:19.470 --> 04:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
they consult with land owners regarding
 
04:44:21.150 --> 04:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
Forest health
 
04:44:23.708 --> 04:44:23.718 align:start position:0%
issues and uh they're they're a key part
 
04:44:25.670 --> 04:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
of what we do for the public and for our
 
04:44:28.750 --> 04:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
state forest um natural heritage Bureau
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you've heard about so they're
 
04:44:32.350 --> 04:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
housed under our division um they
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
conduct environmental reviews um
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere between three and 4,000 reviews
 
04:44:39.310 --> 04:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
a year they also go out and inventory
 
04:44:41.788 --> 04:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
for rare threatened or endangered plants
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
they keep a very significant uh database
 
04:44:48.190 --> 04:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
of uh plants and as well as rare
 
04:44:49.948 --> 04:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
threatened or endangered animal species
 
04:44:52.350 --> 04:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
for fishing game we have a anou with
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
fishing game so they house the data for
 
04:44:55.708 --> 04:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
those rare threatened or endangered
 
04:45:00.628 --> 04:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
plants and of animals sorry um Urban and
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
Community forestry there's a nice
 
04:45:05.550 --> 04:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
picture of uh AJ Dupri planting trees
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
they they visited about I think it was
 
04:45:09.990 --> 04:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
well it says in here I think it was
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
close to 20 schools this year um
 
04:45:15.310 --> 04:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
teaching kids how to care for trees
 
04:45:19.510 --> 04:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
educating them um looks like they did um
 
04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
18 schools this year they've um consult
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
with communities about um Urban trees
 
04:45:29.030 --> 04:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
along streets um uh really an
 
04:45:31.230 --> 04:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
educational program that they provide
 
04:45:33.190 --> 04:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
and it's very well enjoyed there was
 
04:45:35.670 --> 04:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
some recent press we had on that program
 
04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
uh just this
 
04:45:41.470 --> 04:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
week um Forest protection so um they're
 
04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
are one of our more visible bureaus th
 
04:45:45.310 --> 04:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
those are the forest rangers you see in
 
04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
their shiny red pickup trucks that drive
 
04:45:50.070 --> 04:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
around the state they do fire patrol
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
they assist uh significantly with the
 
04:45:54.270 --> 04:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
communities to train and provide
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
equipment to them we have what we call a
 
04:45:59.670 --> 04:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
federal excess program whereby we can
 
04:46:02.310 --> 04:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
get um used fire equipment from the US
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
Forest Service and provide that to the
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
communities so they they're well
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
equipped to fight uh rural fires which
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
of course in New Hampshire that's
 
04:46:14.430 --> 04:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
that's um considerable so they provide
 
04:46:17.230 --> 04:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
training equipment and uh they also do
 
04:46:19.590 --> 04:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
their own patrols for detection early
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
detection we because of the budget cuts
 
04:46:24.110 --> 04:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
we won't be Staffing our fire Towers
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
this year we have 15 fir Towers across
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
the state from Pittsburgh down to
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
Milford um we did we were able thanks to
 
04:46:34.868 --> 04:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
arpa funding we got a little slice of
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
the pie from our friends at Parks and
 
04:46:39.150 --> 04:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
Recreation we got about 2.3 million so
 
04:46:41.430 --> 04:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
we're able to renovate four
 
04:46:43.628 --> 04:46:43.638 align:start position:0%
of our fire Towers our aging fir Towers
 
04:46:45.948 --> 04:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
we replaced the cab and shored up the uh
 
04:46:49.470 --> 04:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
the iron supports um last year it was
 
04:46:53.150 --> 04:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
cardigan and bellnap mountains towers
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
and this year it was pitcher mountain
 
04:46:59.750 --> 04:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
and fedal Hill and uh the we had done I
 
04:47:02.110 --> 04:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
think in 2016 we had restored another
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
four with I guess it was Capital funding
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
at that time but we're able to put the
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
2.3 million in arpa funding to good use
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
so we're we're very pleased with that
 
04:47:13.270 --> 04:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
the contractors did a wonderful job
 
04:47:15.150 --> 04:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they'll be they'll be idle
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
this summer we won't be Staffing them um
 
04:47:20.788 --> 04:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
and those are typically part-time uh
 
04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
folks anyway but
 
04:47:25.990 --> 04:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
um uh so Forest protection was very busy
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
this year as some of you know who
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
followed the news um New England
 
04:47:30.470 --> 04:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
Southern New England was on fire quite a
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
bit this year nothing like our our uh
 
04:47:35.230 --> 04:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
our neighbors out west and you know the
 
04:47:36.430 --> 04:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
terrible things that are going on in
 
04:47:39.150 --> 04:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
California of course but uh Oregon had a
 
04:47:42.030 --> 04:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
number of wildfires that were remote our
 
04:47:44.350 --> 04:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
Foresters we we call them mobilizations
 
04:47:46.030 --> 04:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
we work through the US Forest Service
 
04:47:48.150 --> 04:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
and we send our our firefighters out
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
there to assist them they get valuable
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
training um they help out our our uh our
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
states out there and then uh they can
 
04:47:57.670 --> 04:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
bring that training back here to New
 
04:47:59.708 --> 04:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
England um there was a Thousand Acre
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
fire in Massachusetts this this uh fall
 
04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
it was one of the driest uh novembers on
 
04:48:06.628 --> 04:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
record and uh it really um hit
 
04:48:09.390 --> 04:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Massachusetts and um Vermont
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
had quite a few as well we'll send
 
04:48:14.310 --> 04:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
engines we'll send uh Rangers uh
 
04:48:16.548 --> 04:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
equipment and and it comes back to us
 
04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a regional compact that we
 
04:48:21.390 --> 04:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
belong to so when we have trouble and we
 
04:48:23.150 --> 04:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
need folks um they'll send them down
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
from Quebec the Canadian maritimes from
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
the other states um so it's a very
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
really um uh beneficial uh cooperation
 
04:48:32.708 --> 04:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
we have with with the other states and
 
04:48:34.910 --> 04:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
and the Canadian
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
provinces uh Cooperative Extension as I
 
04:48:39.350 --> 04:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned they're are our um education
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
partner I I won't go into the numbers
 
04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
but uh you know hundreds of land owners
 
04:48:45.670 --> 04:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
private land owners uh workshops to
 
04:48:45.680 --> 04:48:46.990 align:start position:0%
private land owners uh workshops to
Foresters

04:48:46.990 --> 04:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
Foresters
 
04:48:50.708 --> 04:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
loggers um conservation groups um so
 
04:48:52.868 --> 04:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
they they execute our mission in a whole
 
04:48:52.878 --> 04:48:56.190 align:start position:0%
they they execute our mission in a whole
another

04:48:56.190 --> 04:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.200 --> 04:48:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
realm

04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
realm
 
04:49:00.670 --> 04:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
um seedling program so we we run the
 
04:49:02.230 --> 04:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
state Nursery that's under our forest
 
04:49:05.510 --> 04:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
management Bureau um and I think Sarah
 
04:49:07.390 --> 04:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in her comments earlier
 
04:49:10.868 --> 04:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
we uh sell between 200 and 300 seedlings
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
300,000 seedings a year and uh it's it's
 
04:49:18.910 --> 04:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
been in operation since 1910 so the
 
04:49:20.830 --> 04:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is pretty old and as the
 
04:49:22.310 --> 04:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned it was overdue
 
04:49:24.510 --> 04:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
for some uh improvements so this is the
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
first season with a brand new irrigation
 
04:49:29.670 --> 04:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
system and that was uh uh due largely to
 
04:49:32.590 --> 04:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
arpa funding um the the new cooler rooms
 
04:49:34.110 --> 04:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be Capital funding which we
 
04:49:36.868 --> 04:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
had budgeted for over a year ago and
 
04:49:39.548 --> 04:49:39.558 align:start position:0%
that will provide state-of-the-art space
 
04:49:42.270 --> 04:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
to we we have to store the seedlings in
 
04:49:45.948 --> 04:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
um in these um wax line bags uh for a
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
period of time so that when we're ready
 
04:49:49.750 --> 04:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
to ship they're they stay fresh and
 
04:49:53.110 --> 04:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
Alive of course so we U have to have a
 
04:49:55.708 --> 04:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
good uh commercial cooler to store the
 
04:49:57.590 --> 04:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
seedling so it'll be replacing that this
 
04:50:00.030 --> 04:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh probably won't happen till September
 
04:50:04.510 --> 04:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
of of um you know this coming fall um
 
04:50:07.350 --> 04:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
but uh we have big plans to um renovate
 
04:50:09.190 --> 04:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
the rest of the the structure it's an
 
04:50:11.390 --> 04:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
old barn that we occupy there when we
 
04:50:13.868 --> 04:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
when we sort the seedlings and U it's
 
04:50:16.110 --> 04:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
going to improve efficiency and safety
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
and uh with we we've had Banner years in
 
04:50:20.510 --> 04:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
terms of sales as well which is great
 
04:50:22.548 --> 04:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
all that money goes back to the nursery
 
04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
to fund the staff um materials uh we
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
we're very fortunate to have the forest
 
04:50:30.548 --> 04:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
service provide grant funding as well
 
04:50:34.270 --> 04:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple of Grants of 160,000
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
each and that's gone to towards U new
 
04:50:39.910 --> 04:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
planting equipment um we've purchased
 
04:50:41.788 --> 04:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
for the first time time in decades a new
 
04:50:44.110 --> 04:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
tractor which we really needed a new
 
04:50:46.830 --> 04:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
tractor a nice John Deere and uh our
 
04:50:48.628 --> 04:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
Nursery manager is very happy to have
 
04:50:49.868 --> 04:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
that to
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
use man I'm gonna get a sunburn over
 
04:50:56.350 --> 04:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
here um so that's the
 
04:50:59.470 --> 04:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
nursery um I'll just leave it there and
 
04:51:01.230 --> 04:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
open it up for questions we've got a lot
 
04:51:04.150 --> 04:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
of other divisions any questions
 
04:51:07.070 --> 04:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr chair and
 
04:51:11.310 --> 04:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in um last term I
 
04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
served on science and
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
technology and um we had at least one
 
04:51:19.470 --> 04:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
bill where uh people were coming in
 
04:51:19.480 --> 04:51:20.470 align:start position:0%
bill where uh people were coming in
talking

04:51:20.470 --> 04:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
talking
 
04:51:20.480 --> 04:51:22.510 align:start position:0%
talking
about

04:51:22.510 --> 04:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:51:26.910 --> 04:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
um um or organizations that come in and
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
try to uh to to um purchase land that
 
04:51:35.708 --> 04:51:35.718 align:start position:0%
they can then offer to offset car as
 
04:51:39.190 --> 04:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
carbon offsets yes yeah um and I was
 
04:51:41.430 --> 04:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
just wondering if that's anything that
 
04:51:44.030 --> 04:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
that you've gotten involved in or could
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
that be a potential new Revenue source
 
04:51:49.948 --> 04:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
for you oh thanks for the question I'm
 
04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
gonna be as brief as possible so those
 
04:51:56.470 --> 04:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
those bills were aimed at um limiting
 
04:51:59.590 --> 04:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment in carbon um due to the
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
controversy in the North country with
 
04:52:02.310 --> 04:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
the large
 
04:52:07.788 --> 04:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
landowner which created some economic uh
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
um uh issues with with the towns in ter
 
04:52:13.230 --> 04:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of Timber tax wood supply and
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
logging jobs um many of the legislators
 
04:52:18.030 --> 04:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
from the north North Country wanted to
 
04:52:21.310 --> 04:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
see carbon credit programs uh go into a
 
04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium if you will um it really
 
04:52:25.110 --> 04:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to the land is a critical
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
part of it but it's really about the the
 
04:52:30.270 --> 04:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
carbon that's uh sequestered and stored
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
in the trees and that's what um
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
companies and land owners are selling
 
04:52:37.390 --> 04:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
are the the credits for for managing
 
04:52:41.150 --> 04:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
carbon um so there is one one bill
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of bills that are
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
carbon related in the legislature this
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
year um one is to um allow towns to U
 
04:52:54.030 --> 04:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
Levy a tax on the carbon that a land
 
04:52:55.708 --> 04:52:55.718 align:start position:0%
owner if they decide not to cut their
 
04:52:58.030 --> 04:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
trees and therefore forego the timber
 
04:53:01.470 --> 04:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
tax this bill would enable towns to Levy
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
a tax because of their carbon credit
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
generation so that's one bill and then
 
04:53:08.030 --> 04:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
there's another bill though it hasn't
 
04:53:10.548 --> 04:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
hasn't been U introduced the committee
 
04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
yet but they want to prohibit uh carbon
 
04:53:14.548 --> 04:53:14.558 align:start position:0%
credit enrollment for any state lands
 
04:53:16.628 --> 04:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
lands yeah I gu I guess what I was
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
thinking I was thinking more of the fact
 
04:53:23.510 --> 04:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
that you know the land that is in the
 
04:53:25.948 --> 04:53:25.958 align:start position:0%
Parks yeah is already controlled by the
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
state correct um and is there an is
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
there an opportunity there to offer that
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
land as for carbon for carbon offset
 
04:53:39.788 --> 04:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
credits right and this is controversial
 
04:53:41.788 --> 04:53:41.798 align:start position:0%
um because
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
because of the um perception that it
 
04:53:47.868 --> 04:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
impacts the economy there are proponents
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
that don't want to see the state
 
04:53:51.110 --> 04:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
involved in carbon credit
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
Generation Um but carbon credit programs
 
04:53:58.548 --> 04:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
and Timber harvesting are not an either
 
04:54:02.350 --> 04:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
or they're a both and you can do both
 
04:54:04.628 --> 04:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
and do it well without sacrificing jobs
 
04:54:07.948 --> 04:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion um in my what I I know
 
04:54:09.788 --> 04:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
about carbon credit programs you can do
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
both go
 
04:54:15.670 --> 04:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to um just put a footnote
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
that because we are still negotiating
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
with Aurora um up at the Connecticut
 
04:54:20.958 --> 04:54:22.030 align:start position:0%
with Aurora um up at the Connecticut
Lakes

04:54:22.030 --> 04:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
Lakes
 
04:54:25.350 --> 04:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
headquarters um we're not in a position
 
04:54:28.470 --> 04:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
to talk policy at this point until we
 
04:54:31.510 --> 04:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
feel settled and comfortable with an
 
04:54:34.948 --> 04:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
agreement for that property um but there
 
04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
it it it has become a a a Hot Topic and
 
04:54:42.030 --> 04:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
one worthy of discussion um and an
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
understanding and so it's great to see
 
04:54:47.470 --> 04:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
the state house um taking it on and and
 
04:54:49.548 --> 04:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
having thorough discussions scientific
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
discussions economic discussions but as
 
04:54:55.750 --> 04:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
far as the state position we're we want
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
to get through um these negotiations in
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
a successful positive way for the state
 
04:55:03.868 --> 04:55:03.878 align:start position:0%
and then we can learn from the
 
04:55:10.750 --> 04:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:12.070 --> 04:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
I just had a quick question before I
 
04:55:14.548 --> 04:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
forget um how many acres do you think
 
04:55:16.830 --> 04:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
burned last year in New Hampshire and
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:24.190 --> 04:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
years on average our our our burns are
 
04:55:28.110 --> 04:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
typically less than 10 acres um but
 
04:55:30.590 --> 04:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
we've been averaging a little over 200
 
04:55:34.750 --> 04:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
230 uh fires per year the last few years
 
04:55:36.788 --> 04:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
it's a concern
 
04:55:39.390 --> 04:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I can't tell you off the
 
04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
top of my head if that's more than we've
 
04:55:43.110 --> 04:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
had in the past there are some numbers
 
04:55:45.548 --> 04:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
on the forest Protection Bureau sheet
 
04:55:47.590 --> 04:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
that will tell you what we had this past
 
04:55:51.190 --> 04:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
year um but we're definitely concerned
 
04:55:54.110 --> 04:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
because uh you whether you believe in
 
04:55:57.910 --> 04:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
the global CH climate change or not our
 
04:56:00.270 --> 04:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
climate has changed and there are hotter
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
Summers drier Falls I mean we we can't
 
04:56:05.830 --> 04:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
um predict how many fires are going to
 
04:56:08.070 --> 04:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
be each year but we do need to be
 
04:56:12.030 --> 04:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
prepared so um but we can we can we can
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
get you that yeah I'm curious because
 
04:56:17.470 --> 04:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
not only from the perspective of the
 
04:56:20.310 --> 04:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
weather change but also New Hampshire I
 
04:56:22.830 --> 04:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
believe manages their Forest pretty well
 
04:56:25.390 --> 04:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to see uh that has to be a
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
big factor and how do we compare to
 
04:56:29.350 --> 04:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
other states that don't manage the
 
04:56:31.708 --> 04:56:31.718 align:start position:0%
forest like we do Wonder yeah we can get
 
04:56:34.150 --> 04:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
back to you on that that'd be great um
 
04:56:35.270 --> 04:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative eel and then
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you um first of
 
04:56:39.990 --> 04:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
all I want to say that I've worked with
 
04:56:42.190 --> 04:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative Extension Service quite
 
04:56:44.350 --> 04:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
a bit and I think they're fantastic I'm
 
04:56:46.030 --> 04:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
going to give a shout out to uh Tim
 
04:56:49.350 --> 04:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
flurry right here um but just on the
 
04:56:51.910 --> 04:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
issue of Forest Health I mean we talked
 
04:56:54.110 --> 04:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
there a little bit about fires I mean
 
04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
it's just alarming the number of
 
04:56:56.638 --> 04:56:58.270 align:start position:0%
it's just alarming the number of
invasive

04:56:58.270 --> 04:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
invasive
 
04:57:03.190 --> 04:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh bugs among other things and I
 
04:57:06.270 --> 04:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
just can you give us your feelings on
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
the Forest Health and the future and
 
04:57:12.788 --> 04:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
yeah it's very I mean I'm just looking
 
04:57:14.708 --> 04:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
at your on the beaches you thought the
 
04:57:16.750 --> 04:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
beaches would be safe but apparently
 
04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
they're not even safe well I think that
 
04:57:22.190 --> 04:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
beach picture is just a survey of a
 
04:57:24.788 --> 04:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
survey going on but um we we definitely
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
have seen an increase in um there's been
 
04:57:29.390 --> 04:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
a recent wave of spongy moth formerly
 
04:57:32.110 --> 04:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
called Gypsy moth that has killed some
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
trees in New Hampshire along with the
 
04:57:36.590 --> 04:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
very late May Frost we had a few years
 
04:57:39.708 --> 04:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
ago that did leave um a number of Acres
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
with dead particularly oak trees
 
04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I would say we're still in very good
 
04:57:48.430 --> 04:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
shape in terms of the health of our
 
04:57:52.590 --> 04:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
forest um invasive species plant species
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
is another concern it it chokes the
 
04:57:56.670 --> 04:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
undergrowth of of desirable native
 
04:58:00.070 --> 04:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
species um we have a very active uh
 
04:58:02.510 --> 04:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
Forest Health Bureau um they're
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring for um the other one that
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
we've had in the state for a while is um
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
Hemlock wad
 
04:58:10.990 --> 04:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
delid uh so that's that kind of comes
 
04:58:12.548 --> 04:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
and goes this cold snap we're having
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
right now will actually have a an impact
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
on the population that'll knock back
 
04:58:19.990 --> 04:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
those egg masses and we'll see that
 
04:58:22.590 --> 04:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
population not as strong this um spring
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
which is a good thing um we are
 
04:58:28.830 --> 04:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring for Spruce budworm which was
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
devastating back in the 70s our
 
04:58:33.548 --> 04:58:33.558 align:start position:0%
neighbors in Quebec have been dealing
 
04:58:36.150 --> 04:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
with um millions of Acres of of
 
04:58:38.990 --> 04:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
defoliation from uh Spruce budworm and
 
04:58:40.470 --> 04:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
it has showed up in Main the last
 
04:58:42.868 --> 04:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
several years and there's an effort now
 
04:58:44.548 --> 04:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
to increase detection and suppression
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
efforts in Maine and we're partnering
 
04:58:48.310 --> 04:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
with them to do the same in Northern New
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where our Spruce fur forests
 
04:58:49.920 --> 04:58:51.150 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where our Spruce fur forests
are

04:58:51.150 --> 04:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
predominant um but I would say overall
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're okay the climate change does
 
04:58:59.070 --> 04:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
affect population but it's not a cause
 
04:59:01.670 --> 04:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
and effect it just influences these
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
insects and diseases were here before
 
04:59:07.548 --> 04:59:07.558 align:start position:0%
for the most part um many of them not
 
04:59:10.510 --> 04:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
all but many of them and so they EV flow
 
04:59:13.150 --> 04:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
with the weather pattern but it's not
 
04:59:16.190 --> 04:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
all a cause for concern I think we're
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
overall we're doing very well
 
04:59:20.470 --> 04:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative msen I'll uh caution that
 
04:59:22.510 --> 04:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
we only have 20 minutes left and we have
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
a few more directors to meet so sure
 
04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um so I want to just follow
 
04:59:29.670 --> 04:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
up on the on the the you know the
 
04:59:31.830 --> 04:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
questions about you know fire damage and
 
04:59:35.868 --> 04:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
fire risk um and you know given given
 
04:59:39.030 --> 04:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that we did have such a warm
 
04:59:42.110 --> 04:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
fall we're we're having a pretty dry
 
04:59:44.548 --> 04:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
winter so far I mean uh we'll see what
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
happens in the next couple months but so
 
04:59:49.708 --> 04:59:49.718 align:start position:0%
far it's been pretty dry um you know it
 
04:59:51.750 --> 04:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm I'm just a little
 
04:59:55.110 --> 04:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
concerned or or wondering why we would
 
04:59:58.430 --> 04:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
be not not Staffing fire to
 
05:00:01.350 --> 05:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
Towers um and if we're not Staffing them
 
05:00:02.990 --> 05:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
within with people are we doing
 
05:00:05.070 --> 05:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
something else to kind of monitor the
 
05:00:08.430 --> 05:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
situation are we using technology
 
05:00:11.470 --> 05:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
or well
 
05:00:13.948 --> 05:00:13.958 align:start position:0%
um we'll probably do what we can with
 
05:00:16.190 --> 05:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
the Rangers we have we have um we still
 
05:00:18.670 --> 05:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
have uh nine full-time forest rangers
 
05:00:20.190 --> 05:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
who will increase their patrols to the
 
05:00:22.788 --> 05:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
extent possible um we do get Federal
 
05:00:24.910 --> 05:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
funding we have some grant funding that
 
05:00:27.510 --> 05:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
can assist in in monitoring and and
 
05:00:29.830 --> 05:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
patrolling um and we do flights we do
 
05:00:32.548 --> 05:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
aerial flights um with the Civil Air
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
Patrol so we may increase to the extent
 
05:00:37.470 --> 05:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
our budget will allow we'll try to um
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:44.430 --> 05:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you director hyley
 
05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
thanks okay next up Mindy
 
05:00:53.070 --> 05:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
Atwood Mindy serves as the deputy
 
05:00:55.548 --> 05:00:55.558 align:start position:0%
director of the State library but in
 
05:00:57.470 --> 05:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
absence of a state librarian she's
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
wearing multiple hats and keeping our
 
05:01:03.670 --> 05:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
State Library accessible and
 
05:01:06.270 --> 05:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
open good afternoon um as the
 
05:01:07.830 --> 05:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned my name is Mindy
 
05:01:09.430 --> 05:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
Atwood I am the assistant State
 
05:01:11.948 --> 05:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
librarian and the administrator for
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
Library operations at the State Library
 
05:01:17.070 --> 05:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
um I do just want to take one moment and
 
05:01:20.190 --> 05:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
give um homage to Michael York who is
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
the state librarian for 25 years and he
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
would want me to remind all of you that
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
we are the oldest State library in the
 
05:01:30.030 --> 05:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
nation we began in 1717 which is pretty
 
05:01:33.788 --> 05:01:33.798 align:start position:0%
neat um there are some rsas that govern
 
05:01:37.230 --> 05:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Library uh 201a
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
talks about the State Library shall be
 
05:01:41.150 --> 05:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
the official clearing ing house of state
 
05:01:41.160 --> 05:01:42.310 align:start position:0%
the official clearing ing house of state
government

05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:01:46.990 --> 05:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
information um 202b one talks about the
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
legislature finding that providing
 
05:01:52.110 --> 05:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
citizens with access to public documents
 
05:01:54.510 --> 05:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
will allow increased citizen involvement
 
05:01:57.548 --> 05:01:57.558 align:start position:0%
in state policies and Empower citizens
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
to participate in state policy decision
 
05:02:03.150 --> 05:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
making um and then there's other
 
05:02:04.910 --> 05:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
statutes of course that sort of more
 
05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
specifically outline the duties of the
 
05:02:10.270 --> 05:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
State Library um by the number and you
 
05:02:12.190 --> 05:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
will find that in your handout that is
 
05:02:14.548 --> 05:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
in the page I think it's ironic that the
 
05:02:16.670 --> 05:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
librarian brought a one pager and the
 
05:02:18.470 --> 05:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
forest and lands Guy brought like a four
 
05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
or five pager just
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
saying that's right that is some irony
 
05:02:26.590 --> 05:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
right there
 
05:02:29.708 --> 05:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh um so we have about a half a million
 
05:02:32.948 --> 05:02:32.958 align:start position:0%
volumes um at the State Library they are
 
05:02:35.270 --> 05:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
primarily uh state and federal
 
05:02:37.868 --> 05:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
government documents uh we do have a
 
05:02:39.910 --> 05:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
small collection of Library information
 
05:02:42.270 --> 05:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
science Publications um we have a
 
05:02:45.390 --> 05:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
biography collection and then primarily
 
05:02:48.350 --> 05:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
we try to collect about uh books about
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and books by New Hampshire
 
05:02:53.430 --> 05:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
authors and any New Hampshire resident
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
can get a State library card so if you
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a State library card please
 
05:02:59.150 --> 05:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
feel free to stop by we'd be happy to
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
have you sign up for one um we are in a
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
40,000 squ foot building with 22
 
05:03:07.230 --> 05:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
full-time staff and between five and
 
05:03:11.150 --> 05:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
seven part-time and substitute drivers
 
05:03:12.750 --> 05:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
um and I'll talk more about that in a
 
05:03:15.030 --> 05:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
moment um we have many longtime
 
05:03:18.030 --> 05:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
employees uh our four senior staff have
 
05:03:20.270 --> 05:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
an average of more than 15 years of
 
05:03:21.788 --> 05:03:21.798 align:start position:0%
experience at the New Hampshire State
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
library and I'm I'm the new kid on the
 
05:03:26.548 --> 05:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
Block and I'm constantly Amazed by their
 
05:03:28.868 --> 05:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
breadth of knowledge and and their
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
dedication um we received between 1.3
 
05:03:35.708 --> 05:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
and $1.5 million in federal funding from
 
05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
The Institute of Museum and Library
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
services or imls
 
05:03:43.110 --> 05:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
um to receive these federal funds we
 
05:03:46.430 --> 05:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
must both maintain a 50% match of state
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
to federal funds um and then we're also
 
05:03:51.990 --> 05:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
required to produce a five-year plan
 
05:03:53.708 --> 05:03:53.718 align:start position:0%
that outlines the programs that will be
 
05:03:56.190 --> 05:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
subed with federal funds and the larger
 
05:03:58.270 --> 05:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
Improvement in goals that will result
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
from those programs and I'm happy to
 
05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
follow up by email and send you that
 
05:04:07.230 --> 05:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
plan but again it's sort of lengthy um
 
05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
so and then we also support New
 
05:04:14.150 --> 05:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's 234 public libraries 70% of
 
05:04:16.270 --> 05:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
which do serve a population of fewer
 
05:04:17.788 --> 05:04:17.798 align:start position:0%
than 8,000
 
05:04:21.070 --> 05:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
residents um so we also provide services
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the state government really we are
 
05:04:25.548 --> 05:04:25.558 align:start position:0%
collectors we collect and make
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
accessible to both elected officials and
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens things like the
 
05:04:33.788 --> 05:04:33.798 align:start position:0%
sessions law index government documents
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
state agency Publications newspapers
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
from all across the state um and I did
 
05:04:41.350 --> 05:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
as a librar and I just had to bring an
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
example so this is a book um Big Trees
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
of Northern New England short hikes to
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
the biggest trees in Northern
 
05:04:49.110 --> 05:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusettes Vermont New Hampshire and
 
05:04:52.030 --> 05:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
Maine now right now this book is widely
 
05:04:54.270 --> 05:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
available in our public librar it
 
05:04:57.030 --> 05:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
published in 2002 was very popular
 
05:04:59.910 --> 05:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's lots of copies of it but in 25
 
05:05:03.310 --> 05:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
years or in 50 years I would lay good
 
05:05:04.628 --> 05:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
money that the New Hampshire State
 
05:05:07.150 --> 05:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
Library might be the only holder of this
 
05:05:09.070 --> 05:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
book and it documents a moment in time
 
05:05:11.628 --> 05:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
for these big trees that in 25 50 years
 
05:05:14.350 --> 05:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
may very well be gone um so that is a
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
big part of what we try to
 
05:05:19.070 --> 05:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
do um we also offer reference Health to
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
the office of legislative Services as
 
05:05:23.948 --> 05:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
well as individual legislators and other
 
05:05:27.948 --> 05:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
state agencies um we also offer servi
 
05:05:29.948 --> 05:05:29.958 align:start position:0%
services to New Hampshire citizens and I
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
really feel like in this way we're
 
05:05:34.150 --> 05:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
conductors because we help people
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
navigate their own government um we're
 
05:05:40.270 --> 05:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
also the foremost resource in the state
 
05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
for genealogy research and uh we really
 
05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
have the largest collection for people
 
05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
who are looking to do genealogy research
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
and we have a wonderful story of a a
 
05:05:52.548 --> 05:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
young man who came looking for some
 
05:05:55.230 --> 05:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
genealogy information um about his
 
05:05:57.868 --> 05:05:57.878 align:start position:0%
birthfather and our reference librarian
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
Charles Shipman helped him find this
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
information and in fact um this young
 
05:06:05.868 --> 05:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
man saw for the first time a picture of
 
05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
his birth father he had never seen his
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
birth father before so that is some of
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
what we we do we also have an ask a
 
05:06:16.470 --> 05:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
librarian service on our website and we
 
05:06:18.350 --> 05:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
also of course take Walkins at the State
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
library and we really as I said help
 
05:06:24.430 --> 05:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
citizens navigate um state government um
 
05:06:26.830 --> 05:06:26.840 align:start position:0%

05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%

dasi colon 2 and they don't understand
 
05:06:40.670 --> 05:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
what it means so they call and we
 
05:06:42.548 --> 05:06:42.558 align:start position:0%
explain to them that it talks about um
 
05:06:44.708 --> 05:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
the patient family or to the patient
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%

05:06:53.548 --> 05:06:53.558 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid and it tells them
 
05:06:55.948 --> 05:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
how to file Medicaid but people see the
 
05:06:58.628 --> 05:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
statue cited and they have no idea
 
05:07:03.868 --> 05:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
what's happening or saf-c 204 period 04
 
05:07:05.868 --> 05:07:05.878 align:start position:0%

um sometimes people don't really know
 
05:07:16.390 --> 05:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
what that's all about um and we also are
 
05:07:19.030 --> 05:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
connectors we facilitate resource
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%

to the more than 6 million items that
 
05:07:28.390 --> 05:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
are in our Collective New Hampshire
 
05:07:31.150 --> 05:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
libraries um we as the commissioner
 
05:07:33.150 --> 05:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned have an inter Library Loan
 
05:07:36.470 --> 05:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
program that moves more than 160,000
 
05:07:39.868 --> 05:07:39.878 align:start position:0%
items a year uh we have five van on the
 
05:07:42.390 --> 05:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
road Monday Tuesday Thursday and Friday
 
05:07:44.310 --> 05:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
and on Wednesdays we have six vans on
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
the road those vans cover within the
 
05:07:50.750 --> 05:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
state more than 220,000 miles a
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
year um we also um so as an example in
 
05:07:59.470 --> 05:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
the small But Mighty town of Mont Vernon
 
05:07:59.480 --> 05:08:02.150 align:start position:0%

05:08:04.990 --> 05:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
2,674 we support no fewer than eight
 
05:08:07.470 --> 05:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
book groups that run through that
 
05:08:10.350 --> 05:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
Library um another example ex Le is that
 
05:08:12.270 --> 05:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
we um do host the New Hampshire
 
05:08:15.390 --> 05:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
downloadable books Consortium which uh
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
allows our citizens access to um shared
 
05:08:23.430 --> 05:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
econtent um so we do provide a wide
 
05:08:24.990 --> 05:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
variety of functions and service for
 
05:08:27.510 --> 05:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
government citizens and the public
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
libraries of New Hampshire I happy to
 
05:08:31.110 --> 05:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
take your
 
05:08:34.590 --> 05:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
questions yes uh personally uh I would
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
like to know amongst the Six Million
 
05:08:38.230 --> 05:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
items that you have do you have any
 
05:08:41.230 --> 05:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
coins and any coins coins do you have
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
any a lot of libraries have big coin
 
05:08:45.430 --> 05:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
collections and I'm a collector so I was
 
05:08:47.230 --> 05:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
Wonder I've never been in there and just
 
05:08:48.548 --> 05:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
wondering do you have any point
 
05:08:50.350 --> 05:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
interesting well first of all I would
 
05:08:52.430 --> 05:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
say you should come and our reference
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
librarian will answer that question much
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
more a than I I'm sure we have books
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
about coin collecting but coins that
 
05:09:01.708 --> 05:09:01.718 align:start position:0%
were held by libraries I would guess
 
05:09:03.150 --> 05:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
they would feel those were very precious
 
05:09:04.948 --> 05:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
and they might not want to share those
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
out but you could perhaps go visit and
 
05:09:10.670 --> 05:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
to piggyback on that because I see a lot
 
05:09:13.230 --> 05:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
of untapped potential with the treasures
 
05:09:17.110 --> 05:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
that we are tasked to protect um we have
 
05:09:20.030 --> 05:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
recently hired a curator who is here
 
05:09:22.510 --> 05:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
with us today Jen who is her office is
 
05:09:25.070 --> 05:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
in the library and she's pouring over so
 
05:09:27.070 --> 05:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
many drawers and cabinets where our
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
staff over the years have felt things
 
05:09:31.270 --> 05:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
are safer locked up uh and we're
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
discovering a lot of stories and
 
05:09:35.230 --> 05:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
untapped potential to educate the public
 
05:09:38.030 --> 05:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
about our Collective history so we will
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
get back to you on coins but we're
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
discovering a lot of stuff yeah if you
 
05:09:42.750 --> 05:09:42.760 align:start position:0%

05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
this year we were created in 1965
 
05:10:15.670 --> 05:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
through RSA 19 currently we have eight
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
positions dedicated to the division of
 
05:10:20.030 --> 05:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
Arts four of which are federally funded
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
four are state funded one is currently a
 
05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
general fund position that is vacant and
 
05:10:29.230 --> 05:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
is likely to stay that way until uh
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
budget decisions and such there are 15
 
05:10:33.670 --> 05:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
different people who are volunteers that
 
05:10:35.230 --> 05:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
make up our New Hampshire State Council
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
on the Arts and they are all dedicated
 
05:10:38.160 --> 05:10:39.788 align:start position:0%
on the Arts and they are all dedicated
to

05:10:39.788 --> 05:10:39.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:10:42.548 --> 05:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
really helping to enhance and strengthen
 
05:10:44.590 --> 05:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
and move our strategic plan Mission
 
05:10:47.510 --> 05:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
Vision and goals of making sure that we
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
are taking care of the economic social
 
05:10:52.070 --> 05:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
and cultural needs and changing
 
05:10:54.590 --> 05:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
landscapes in New Hampshire and all of
 
05:10:57.150 --> 05:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
those 15 people are also just uh they're
 
05:10:59.230 --> 05:10:59.240 align:start position:0%
nominated by the governor and then
 
05:11:01.910 --> 05:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
approved by the executive
 
05:11:04.868 --> 05:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
Council we are primarily funded by the
 
05:11:08.070 --> 05:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
Nea and then with there is a match
 
05:11:10.788 --> 05:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
requirement for that Grant so in the
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
2325 fiscal year that was one of the
 
05:11:15.830 --> 05:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
first times that the council was able to
 
05:11:18.390 --> 05:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
match General funds with our federal
 
05:11:22.910 --> 05:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
fund award and so the match piece is a
 
05:11:24.990 --> 05:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
complicated one for us at the Arts in
 
05:11:28.350 --> 05:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
that so let's say if we only had
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
$750,000 of General funds to match our
 
05:11:33.868 --> 05:11:33.878 align:start position:0%
federal award we would then that would
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
be 250,000 Less in general and then we
 
05:11:39.310 --> 05:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't accept 250,000 Less in the the
 
05:11:40.990 --> 05:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
federal fund so really it can be a
 
05:11:43.510 --> 05:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
$500,000 loss overall for what we're
 
05:11:47.150 --> 05:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:49.948 --> 05:11:49.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have eight different Grant
 
05:11:52.910 --> 05:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
areas which we gave out over 220 Grant
 
05:11:55.350 --> 05:11:55.360 align:start position:0%

is appropriate and if the award is over
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
$10,000 to any individual organization
 
05:12:38.030 --> 05:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
then it comes to the governor and
 
05:12:42.150 --> 05:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:44.310 --> 05:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
approval I'm trying to be mindful of
 
05:12:46.390 --> 05:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
time so if you have any questions in any
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
area please let me know any questions
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
sure representative evil yeah so I'm
 
05:12:54.270 --> 05:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
just looking at this Arts and Cultural
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
production satellite
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
account so it says that we're 48th among
 
05:13:03.990 --> 05:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
all states in employment growth and I
 
05:13:06.750 --> 05:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
mean could you just explain a little bit
 
05:13:10.708 --> 05:13:10.718 align:start position:0%
what looking at this is this not you
 
05:13:12.270 --> 05:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
oh don't have it in front of you no I'm
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have that in front of me
 
05:13:17.350 --> 05:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
umk Arts and Cultural production
 
05:13:20.470 --> 05:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
satellite account this is conducted by
 
05:13:23.150 --> 05:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of economic oh I see analysis
 
05:13:25.590 --> 05:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's National
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
assessment so it does it just like
 
05:13:30.708 --> 05:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
reflect investment in arts compared to
 
05:13:33.750 --> 05:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
other states this is the feds assessing
 
05:13:36.510 --> 05:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
our investments in every state comparing
 
05:13:39.788 --> 05:13:39.798 align:start position:0%
and contrasting and yeah we're at
 
05:13:43.350 --> 05:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
on the lower end of that
 
05:13:48.310 --> 05:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:52.350 --> 05:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
much okay thank You Adele last but not
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
least we've got the division of
 
05:13:54.240 --> 05:13:58.708 align:start position:0%
least we've got the division of
historical

05:13:58.708 --> 05:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:01.110 --> 05:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
resources Representatives I'm Ben Wilson
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of the division of
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
historical resources and the state uh
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
historic preservation officer um what we
 
05:14:10.910 --> 05:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
don't do is yoga on the beach or measure
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
trees um or poetry out loud things like
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
that but uh like my colleagues uh behind
 
05:14:19.868 --> 05:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
me we do touch every community in the
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
state in some fashion um we are a
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
division of 10 staff our funding is 6040
 
05:14:31.868 --> 05:14:31.878 align:start position:0%
60% Federal funding and 40% General
 
05:14:34.830 --> 05:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
funds uh so that's uh six staff under
 
05:14:38.628 --> 05:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
feds and four under General funds um our
 
05:14:41.430 --> 05:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
major program is reviewing compliance so
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
any project going on in the state that
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
has uh an EPA permit for uh sewer water
 
05:14:54.948 --> 05:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
um uh has Federal monies um through the
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
um Highway bill or state funding going
 
05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
into infrastructure projects um we
 
05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
review all those projects we do nearly
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
2,000 uh reviews a year um and that
 
05:15:09.750 --> 05:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
takes up a great deal of our time time
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
um in your packet I've provided uh sort
 
05:15:14.788 --> 05:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
of a brief overview of what the the
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
division does as well as our latest
 
05:15:18.910 --> 05:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
newsletter that has some year-end
 
05:15:20.948 --> 05:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
numbers um and I'm just going to quickly
 
05:15:23.548 --> 05:15:23.558 align:start position:0%
go through our programs um that are in
 
05:15:27.070 --> 05:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
that uh that's in that packet um so
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
aside from review and compliance uh we
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
manage the national register and state
 
05:15:34.270 --> 05:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
Register programs um we manage the
 
05:15:37.070 --> 05:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
federal tax credit program so uh
 
05:15:39.470 --> 05:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
developers trying to get their finan put
 
05:15:41.390 --> 05:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
together to make their projects work
 
05:15:45.270 --> 05:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
specifically in housing um that uh tax
 
05:15:47.430 --> 05:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
credit program can be a huge boost and
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
make things
 
05:15:51.310 --> 05:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
happen uh we manage uh our certified
 
05:15:54.310 --> 05:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
local government uh grant program uh we
 
05:15:56.750 --> 05:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
have to dedicate 10% of our Federal
 
05:16:00.190 --> 05:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
grant to uh grants to communities that
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
have uh included historic preservation
 
05:16:07.788 --> 05:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
and a Heritage commission um in their uh
 
05:16:11.628 --> 05:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
planning um uh we spend about
 
05:16:13.830 --> 05:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
$250,000 or give away
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
$250,000 annually in Moose plate grants
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
those are uh grants that usually average
 
05:16:21.750 --> 05:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
between 10 and
 
05:16:24.070 --> 05:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
$20,000 uh and they specifically go to
 
05:16:27.150 --> 05:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities for uh locally owned uh
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
publicly owned buildings and uh burial
 
05:16:32.470 --> 05:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
grounds and other significant historic
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
resources uh in a in a
 
05:16:40.150 --> 05:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
town um we house the state archaeology
 
05:16:43.990 --> 05:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
um the state archaeologist has to
 
05:16:47.670 --> 05:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
oversee um basically all reviews of of
 
05:16:50.590 --> 05:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
the projects that I mentioned earlier um
 
05:16:52.948 --> 05:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
the state archae state archaeologist
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
also uh operates a field School uh over
 
05:16:58.868 --> 05:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
the course of a month in the summer um
 
05:17:00.628 --> 05:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
those field schools bring together
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
volunteers and professional
 
05:17:05.150 --> 05:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
archaeologists to do um archaeological
 
05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
digs and investigations um primarily on
 
05:17:09.510 --> 05:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
state land
 
05:17:12.868 --> 05:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
and again primarily in State Park uh
 
05:17:16.430 --> 05:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
lands um which is a huge
 
05:17:20.150 --> 05:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
benefit um the say archaeologist also
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
has to deal with unmarked Graves so if a
 
05:17:26.590 --> 05:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
developer or a project discovers um an
 
05:17:28.750 --> 05:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
unmarked grave bones and that sort of
 
05:17:31.230 --> 05:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
thing um which happens more often than
 
05:17:34.030 --> 05:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
you would guess um the state
 
05:17:37.350 --> 05:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
archaeologist gets involved with the um
 
05:17:41.430 --> 05:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh with the state police and the um uh
 
05:17:43.948 --> 05:17:43.958 align:start position:0%
with other folks involved and um has to
 
05:17:46.110 --> 05:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it's a historic
 
05:17:50.190 --> 05:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
grave or um possibly a crime scene um
 
05:17:51.948 --> 05:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things so it's a it's a
 
05:17:54.910 --> 05:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
big it's a big deal it's a big position
 
05:17:58.470 --> 05:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
um that he manages very very well um we
 
05:18:00.788 --> 05:18:00.798 align:start position:0%
manage approximately 40 easements on
 
05:18:03.750 --> 05:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
properties and buildings um uh probably
 
05:18:05.430 --> 05:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
our most significant one is canterburry
 
05:18:07.788 --> 05:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
Shaker Village we oversee the entire
 
05:18:10.830 --> 05:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
campus there and um monitor all the

Lehman go ahead as long as it's not
 
05:19:19.708 --> 05:19:19.718 align:start position:0%
about archaeology specifically because I
 
05:19:22.310 --> 05:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't have my degree in
 
05:19:24.510 --> 05:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
that it's nice to see you good to see
 
05:19:27.590 --> 05:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
you nice to see of course um I noticed
 
05:19:29.070 --> 05:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
in your covered letter you said you had
 
05:19:31.350 --> 05:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
about a 4% cut in your budget have you
 
05:19:33.670 --> 05:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
been asked for additional Cuts or is
 
05:19:35.948 --> 05:19:35.958 align:start position:0%
that what you've been told for percent
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
is adequate thank you um so what I
 
05:19:40.830 --> 05:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
handed out is what is um publicly
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
available um and was due in November

this was our presentation um Chris
 
05:19:49.830 --> 05:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
Marino who's with us um has all of the
 
05:19:52.510 --> 05:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
numbers on a spreadsheet there has been
 
05:19:55.868 --> 05:19:55.878 align:start position:0%
no other final analysis we have gone
 
05:19:57.190 --> 05:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
through several
 
05:19:59.910 --> 05:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
exercises um with different numbers but
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
this is the only um you know public
 
05:20:07.470 --> 05:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
budget number that we have put together
 
05:20:09.548 --> 05:20:09.558 align:start position:0%

our archaeologists could also see if
 
05:20:32.110 --> 05:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
they have any coins for you to look at
 
05:20:33.628 --> 05:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
so we'll check on that that would be
 
05:20:36.510 --> 05:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you all is this

muns be recognized and he said I don't
 
05:21:01.628 --> 05:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
05:21:05.628 --> 05:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
but so we don't that would be where I
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
would stop
 
05:21:09.788 --> 05:21:09.798 align:start position:0%

is Deana jurus executive director office
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
of professional lure and with
 
05:22:17.190 --> 05:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
me Heather Kelly director of
 
05:22:19.230 --> 05:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
operations so we've handed out a
 
05:22:21.070 --> 05:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
presentation kind of giving you an
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
overview of the office and then
 
05:22:23.830 --> 05:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
answering the specific questions that
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
were posed via email um so I'm just
 
05:22:27.910 --> 05:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and walk through this
 
05:22:30.830 --> 05:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
any really um specific numbers questions
 
05:22:33.628 --> 05:22:33.638 align:start position:0%
I will probably defer to Heather um but
 
05:22:36.548 --> 05:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
happy to F any questions that you have
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
so again just overview the office of
 
05:22:40.628 --> 05:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
certification um the vision and mission
 
05:22:44.430 --> 05:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
statements are here we're just looking
 
05:22:47.910 --> 05:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
at Public Health welfare and safety um
 
05:22:49.470 --> 05:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
and the public Trust of the citizens of
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire um so just a
 
05:22:54.670 --> 05:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
guiding principle on that first page I
 
05:22:57.830 --> 05:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
will um I will move at a fairly high
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
level happy to get into details if you
 
05:23:01.350 --> 05:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
have questions but want to um make sure
 
05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
I respect your time and many of you are
 
05:23:05.708 --> 05:23:05.718 align:start position:0%
aware probably well aware of this the
 
05:23:07.830 --> 05:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
organization at this point so the office
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
oversees the administration of over 50
 
05:23:11.628 --> 05:23:11.638 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing boards councils
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
and commissions within the state of New
 
05:23:15.310 --> 05:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we don't give a specific
 
05:23:17.030 --> 05:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
number because nearly every legislative
 
05:23:20.910 --> 05:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
session it changes uh some come some go
 
05:23:23.150 --> 05:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
um presently there are seven advisory
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
boards as opposed to the independent
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
regulatory board so it's a slightly
 
05:23:30.628 --> 05:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
different um operational structure there
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
um they the on the first page it said
 
05:23:37.230 --> 05:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
over 200,000 individuals I believe the
 
05:23:41.670 --> 05:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
number in 2024 was 212 and and change
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
212,000 um with the population increase
 
05:23:46.110 --> 05:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
my back of the napkin math needs to
 
05:23:47.948 --> 05:23:47.958 align:start position:0%
change I used to say about 20% of the
 
05:23:49.350 --> 05:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
state I think it's a little less than
 
05:23:52.430 --> 05:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
that now with the increase um but I will
 
05:23:54.070 --> 05:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
bone up on that for future uh
 
05:23:56.628 --> 05:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
legislative presentations um staff
 
05:23:58.190 --> 05:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
largely assists boards councils and
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
commissions with two major functions so
 
05:24:01.708 --> 05:24:01.718 align:start position:0%
it's licensing individuals who wish to
 
05:24:03.510 --> 05:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire and ensuring
 
05:24:04.708 --> 05:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
compliance with the laws through
 
05:24:07.470 --> 05:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
investigations or inspections we average
 
05:24:09.990 --> 05:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
about 100 complaints month and we
 
05:24:14.030 --> 05:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:17.150 --> 05:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
annually um I like to say the uh this
 
05:24:20.788 --> 05:24:20.798 align:start position:0%
it's a very regulatory office um the way
 
05:24:23.070 --> 05:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
that thing like we incur costs is that
 
05:24:25.190 --> 05:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
people request a license that's required
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
by law or they end up violating law or
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
rule that is um required for them to do
 
05:24:31.548 --> 05:24:31.558 align:start position:0%
their work so um we're not launching
 
05:24:33.990 --> 05:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
extra programs uh this really is just a
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
response and we're always looking back
 
05:24:37.470 --> 05:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
to the statute I've said in previous
 
05:24:39.030 --> 05:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
presentations I will say again if the
 
05:24:40.590 --> 05:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
law says it we do it if it doesn't we
 
05:24:42.990 --> 05:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't and uh we're consistently looking
 
05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
that as we're working through processes
 
05:24:47.830 --> 05:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
um anyway if it's streamlining or just
 
05:24:49.868 --> 05:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
doing review of rules anything like that
 
05:24:51.230 --> 05:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're always going back to the statute
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
to just say what is the authority do we
 
05:24:54.990 --> 05:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
have what do we have to do if we don't
 
05:24:57.150 --> 05:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
have to do it by law we're not doing it
 
05:25:00.030 --> 05:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
um so just on uh slide four the
 
05:25:02.788 --> 05:25:02.798 align:start position:0%
structure in purpose so we have the
 
05:25:04.788 --> 05:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
administrative clerical business
 
05:25:07.830 --> 05:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
processing recordkeeping support um to
 
05:25:10.510 --> 05:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
boards councils and commissions um so
 
05:25:13.948 --> 05:25:13.958 align:start position:0%
that takes several different forms the
 
05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
First Column enforcement is a division
 
05:25:18.310 --> 05:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
which there's investigations and
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
prosecutions there there's licensing and
 
05:25:22.390 --> 05:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
board Administration which is another
 
05:25:24.910 --> 05:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
division so we have board administrator
 
05:25:26.270 --> 05:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
um folks who help with agendas
 
05:25:29.590 --> 05:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
organizing board members we have 25300
 
05:25:31.070 --> 05:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers that are in and out of the
 
05:25:32.350 --> 05:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
office serving on these boards it's
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
quite the operation um and then
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
licensing as well they're reviewing
 
05:25:38.910 --> 05:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
those credentials and then comping so
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
ensuring um compliance with continuing
 
05:25:44.070 --> 05:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
education if there are um facilities
 
05:25:46.628 --> 05:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
requirements um cosmetology shops would
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
be one where there's inspections that
 
05:25:49.628 --> 05:25:49.638 align:start position:0%
there's requirements they have to meet
 
05:25:51.430 --> 05:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's routines inspections completed
 
05:25:53.910 --> 05:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
for that then the director of operations
 
05:25:55.910 --> 05:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
which is Heather um you have human
 
05:25:58.910 --> 05:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
resources Finance it contracts project
 
05:26:01.868 --> 05:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
management all of those pieces there in
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
addition reporting directly to the
 
05:26:05.548 --> 05:26:05.558 align:start position:0%
executive director we have um general
 
05:26:07.390 --> 05:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
counsel so there's agency counsel for
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
the office and then we have positions
 
05:26:10.990 --> 05:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
that are just for board counsel so those
 
05:26:13.110 --> 05:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
are attorneys that are providing advice
 
05:26:15.310 --> 05:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
to boards during board meetings and then
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
the hearings Bureau we have
 
05:26:18.070 --> 05:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
administrative law judges there are two
 
05:26:20.430 --> 05:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
of those currently and a hearings clerk
 
05:26:21.788 --> 05:26:21.798 align:start position:0%
so if things are moving through
 
05:26:23.910 --> 05:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
adjudication the board said as finders
 
05:26:25.310 --> 05:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
of fact I'll get into a few more of
 
05:26:26.910 --> 05:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
those specifics but we have an
 
05:26:28.430 --> 05:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
administrative law judge used to be
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
called the hearings officer who presides
 
05:26:32.788 --> 05:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
over that and makes the the legal
 
05:26:35.390 --> 05:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
determination there I will just pause
 
05:26:37.470 --> 05:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
there if there's any questions I'm happy
 
05:26:39.230 --> 05:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
to keep going just want to give an
 
05:26:41.750 --> 05:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity there uh how many total
 
05:26:45.910 --> 05:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
employees do you have I'm authorized for
 
05:26:48.430 --> 05:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
120 presently I don't have a headcount
 
05:26:52.110 --> 05:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:56.548 --> 05:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
you we are not at20 I can
 
05:27:00.190 --> 05:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
confirm I won't read go ahead I'm sorry
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
I won't read through this whole slide
 
05:27:03.510 --> 05:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
but just to give a a sense of the
 
05:27:05.830 --> 05:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
executive director responsibilities so
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
statutorily it's kind of broken in these
 
05:27:09.670 --> 05:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
are responsib abilities of the boards
 
05:27:10.990 --> 05:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
council's commissions and then the
 
05:27:13.548 --> 05:27:13.558 align:start position:0%
executive director meaning the office so
 
05:27:15.910 --> 05:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
there supervis supervision of Staff
 
05:27:17.628 --> 05:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
employment of appropriate
 
05:27:19.948 --> 05:27:19.958 align:start position:0%
personnel examination processing and
 
05:27:22.510 --> 05:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
approval of licenses or
 
05:27:25.110 --> 05:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
denial um investigation of complaints of
 
05:27:27.430 --> 05:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
professional misconduct we maintain the
 
05:27:29.830 --> 05:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
official record so 91a records requests
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
are handled by the office not the
 
05:27:34.110 --> 05:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
individual boards were also tasked with
 
05:27:37.270 --> 05:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
coordinating rulemaking in 2024 the
 
05:27:39.910 --> 05:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
office was respons for 70 um no excuse
 
05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
me 27 not 72 27% of the proposals filed
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the ru making
 
05:27:48.788 --> 05:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
register in the entire State I will
 
05:27:50.628 --> 05:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
proudly say we have one full-time and
 
05:27:54.310 --> 05:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
two part-time rules Personnel um I like
 
05:27:55.788 --> 05:27:55.798 align:start position:0%
to joke what I don't know what other
 
05:27:57.548 --> 05:27:57.558 align:start position:0%
departments are doing we we're doing it
 
05:28:00.510 --> 05:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
with three um all joking aside there's
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of there but that that's
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
a hefty lift for us that the ru making
 
05:28:07.548 --> 05:28:07.558 align:start position:0%
process is is quite extensive there um
 
05:28:09.868 --> 05:28:09.878 align:start position:0%
again maintain Ming confidentiality and
 
05:28:11.548 --> 05:28:11.558 align:start position:0%
then we have our annual report which is
 
05:28:13.670 --> 05:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
available on our website also happy to
 
05:28:15.070 --> 05:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
forward to the committee if you'd like
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
to have that right in your email inbox
 
05:28:19.830 --> 05:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:22.510 --> 05:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
homepage again in slide six just giving
 
05:28:26.590 --> 05:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
the uh board responsibilities so they um
 
05:28:28.670 --> 05:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
adopt the rules per each profession so
 
05:28:30.510 --> 05:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
essentially the board set the criteria
 
05:28:32.510 --> 05:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
for lure that are objective and then the
 
05:28:34.270 --> 05:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
office processes applications in light
 
05:28:36.510 --> 05:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
of those objective criteria if there is
 
05:28:39.310 --> 05:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
a question um something is unclear that
 
05:28:40.868 --> 05:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
can be brought to the boards for their
 
05:28:43.230 --> 05:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
expertise um but largely we are able to
 
05:28:45.750 --> 05:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
process those I'm happy to say that over
 
05:28:49.310 --> 05:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
80% of licenses were processed within um
 
05:28:52.788 --> 05:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
a 30-day window um which is excellent uh
 
05:28:54.510 --> 05:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
it used to be a lot longer time frame
 
05:28:56.470 --> 05:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
than that so as the criteria become more
 
05:28:58.628 --> 05:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
objective we're streamlining processes
 
05:29:00.310 --> 05:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
getting staff well trained we're able to
 
05:29:01.868 --> 05:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
move those really quickly there's no
 
05:29:04.628 --> 05:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
backlog of Licensing applications
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
presently um again there are 212 plus
 
05:29:08.948 --> 05:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
active licensing in
 
05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
2024 we issue an average and again the
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
math is some weeks are very busy some
 
05:29:15.910 --> 05:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
weeks are slower for renewals because
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's based on the date of issuance not a
 
05:29:19.868 --> 05:29:19.878 align:start position:0%
birthday or a set date and statute for
 
05:29:21.628 --> 05:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
most boards but ends up being about
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
2,000 to 3,000 licenses a week and
 
05:29:26.548 --> 05:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
currently our customer service team
 
05:29:30.110 --> 05:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
answers 95 to 99% of all calls our wait
 
05:29:33.868 --> 05:29:33.878 align:start position:0%
time is about 30 seconds and about and
 
05:29:36.910 --> 05:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
100% of daily emails I'm really excited
 
05:29:38.510 --> 05:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
to tell you about that um that we've
 
05:29:40.350 --> 05:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
been really working on those processes
 
05:29:41.868 --> 05:29:41.878 align:start position:0%
uh this time last year those numbers
 
05:29:45.470 --> 05:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
were not even close to that so um been a
 
05:29:48.270 --> 05:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
lot of work on that side of the house um
 
05:29:50.190 --> 05:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
the enforcement division is in the
 
05:29:52.070 --> 05:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
middle of a review of all complaints for
 
05:29:54.590 --> 05:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
legal viability and to do some data
 
05:29:58.150 --> 05:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
cleanup so there's a um a new director
 
05:30:00.670 --> 05:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
her name is Sarah Rogers of enforcement
 
05:30:02.230 --> 05:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
we're working to streamline processes
 
05:30:03.948 --> 05:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
collaborate with boards there was a lot
 
05:30:05.910 --> 05:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
of data cleanup that needed to happen so
 
05:30:08.030 --> 05:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
when we were looking through um and if
 
05:30:09.270 --> 05:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
you look in our annual report you will
 
05:30:11.948 --> 05:30:11.958 align:start position:0%
see there are some numbers that are um
 
05:30:13.470 --> 05:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
they're just not quite right and so
 
05:30:14.788 --> 05:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do the cleanup to make
 
05:30:17.150 --> 05:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
sure we have an accurate count just in
 
05:30:19.590 --> 05:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
general um we are making good progress I
 
05:30:21.750 --> 05:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate in within the next month to
 
05:30:24.070 --> 05:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
have that completed um so we will have
 
05:30:26.990 --> 05:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
some good information there as well and
 
05:30:28.350 --> 05:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
then I already touched on this piece
 
05:30:30.670 --> 05:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
with ro making responsible for over 25%
 
05:30:32.230 --> 05:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
of initial proposals in the r making
 
05:30:33.510 --> 05:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
register in
 
05:30:35.470 --> 05:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
2024 because of the nature of this
 
05:30:36.948 --> 05:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
process you guys are all familiar with
 
05:30:39.548 --> 05:30:39.558 align:start position:0%
it these Ru making takes a long time
 
05:30:41.390 --> 05:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
when you add a board into the process it
 
05:30:43.510 --> 05:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
adds about five it could add up to five
 
05:30:45.948 --> 05:30:45.958 align:start position:0%
months of time that it takes to get a a
 
05:30:47.708 --> 05:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
rule from the initial proposal to
 
05:30:49.708 --> 05:30:49.718 align:start position:0%
adopted just because of the length of
 
05:30:52.510 --> 05:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
time for review hearings public comment
 
05:30:54.670 --> 05:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
boards work working back and forth so
 
05:30:57.510 --> 05:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a 13-month process so
 
05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
and we have 57 boards so the we're still
 
05:31:03.910 --> 05:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
working to update rules in light of HB
 
05:31:07.110 --> 05:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
655 which was a major reorganization and
 
05:31:10.590 --> 05:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
then 1095 in 2024 so we are actively
 
05:31:12.670 --> 05:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
tracking that working with boards um but
 
05:31:15.390 --> 05:31:15.400 align:start position:0%
there's the the lag is there there is at
 
05:31:17.590 --> 05:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
least a full year lag of when the rules
 
05:31:18.788 --> 05:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
have caught up with those statutory
 
05:31:21.708 --> 05:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
changes just because of the sheer volume
 
05:31:23.310 --> 05:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
and then we also have a staff member
 
05:31:26.830 --> 05:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
presently working on um in RSA 310
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
there's a specific mandate for rule
 
05:31:30.030 --> 05:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
making specific to military service
 
05:31:32.510 --> 05:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
members experience and working on rules
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
for each board so we're also working
 
05:31:36.190 --> 05:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
through that
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
presently um I'm going to be moving more
 
05:31:40.270 --> 05:31:40.280 align:start position:0%
into source of funds and those specific
 
05:31:41.830 --> 05:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
questions so if we have operational is
 
05:31:44.590 --> 05:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
happy to kind of pause representative Ms
 
05:31:46.350 --> 05:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you thaning my
 
05:31:52.030 --> 05:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
question um the the backlog in rules
 
05:31:55.750 --> 05:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
um uh you mentioned the boards getting
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
involved but are there other um things
 
05:32:01.708 --> 05:32:01.718 align:start position:0%
getting in the way I mean you know do
 
05:32:04.628 --> 05:32:04.638 align:start position:0%
you need more staff is there a
 
05:32:08.470 --> 05:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
technology uh issue um you know is there
 
05:32:12.470 --> 05:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities for AI for example to
 
05:32:14.788 --> 05:32:14.798 align:start position:0%
speed it up what what's your assessment
 
05:32:17.190 --> 05:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
of you know I mean do you have the
 
05:32:19.030 --> 05:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
resources you need to get the to get the
 
05:32:21.868 --> 05:32:21.878 align:start position:0%
job done or is basically my question
 
05:32:24.070 --> 05:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'm I would say I'm currently
 
05:32:25.948 --> 05:32:25.958 align:start position:0%
evaluating that it's hard to say we're
 
05:32:28.030 --> 05:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
not getting a lot done in terms of just
 
05:32:30.430 --> 05:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
the volume trying to evaluate currently
 
05:32:33.310 --> 05:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
we have two part-time drafters is that
 
05:32:34.910 --> 05:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
is the makeup of one full-time and two
 
05:32:38.030 --> 05:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
part-time the right kind of mix um We
 
05:32:40.190 --> 05:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
additionally we do have a software for
 
05:32:43.470 --> 05:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
rule making that um that helps us has
 
05:32:45.310 --> 05:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
helped us streamline those processes
 
05:32:46.948 --> 05:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
really provides clarity mean make sure
 
05:32:49.390 --> 05:32:49.400 align:start position:0%
that we're keeping track of things um we
 
05:32:50.788 --> 05:32:50.798 align:start position:0%
rolled that out I think we've been using
 
05:32:52.990 --> 05:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
that for just about a year is that right
 
05:32:54.628 --> 05:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
um so that's dramatically improved our
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
process um in that regard um still
 
05:32:59.628 --> 05:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
evaluating what the resources will be
 
05:33:02.430 --> 05:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
needed I guess the other question is am
 
05:33:05.788 --> 05:33:05.798 align:start position:0%
I going to undergo a full um you know
 
05:33:08.830 --> 05:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
statutory revision of the makeup of the
 
05:33:12.190 --> 05:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
office every 3 years uh or is it going
 
05:33:13.510 --> 05:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
to you know not that there's changes
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
around the edges but the the kind of
 
05:33:18.670 --> 05:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
just the dramatic shift over the last
 
05:33:21.030 --> 05:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
three years I don't anticipate that
 
05:33:23.910 --> 05:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
churn continuing so what I don't want to
 
05:33:26.708 --> 05:33:26.718 align:start position:0%
do is staff way up and then get to a
 
05:33:29.310 --> 05:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
stasis you know so trying to evaluate do
 
05:33:30.990 --> 05:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
we just need to get over the hump it is
 
05:33:37.948 --> 05:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
something I'm actively looking at um yes
 
05:33:40.990 --> 05:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so just getting on to so slide
 
05:33:43.990 --> 05:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
seven with source of funds um the oplc
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
has not received General funds in the
 
05:33:47.948 --> 05:33:47.958 align:start position:0%
last five years so 2018 was the last
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
year that they received General funds to
 
05:33:51.470 --> 05:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
fund its operation we currently have a
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund um that was established
 
05:33:56.868 --> 05:33:56.878 align:start position:0%
and here we list House Bill 409 which in
 
05:33:59.310 --> 05:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
2023 allows the oper the agency to
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
operate more efficiently and effectively
 
05:34:03.230 --> 05:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
so it was happening prior to that is the
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
office was lapsing back into the general
 
05:34:08.270 --> 05:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
fund um but starting with 0 and making
 
05:34:10.708 --> 05:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
payroll is very challenging um so the
 
05:34:12.590 --> 05:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
idea was to have some amount it's up to
 
05:34:16.150 --> 05:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
$3 million to roll over year toe it's
 
05:34:18.510 --> 05:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
all still spent on agency operations so
 
05:34:20.070 --> 05:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
that is the current function it's
 
05:34:20.080 --> 05:34:21.070 align:start position:0%
that is the current function it's
entirely

05:34:21.070 --> 05:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
05:34:23.830 --> 05:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
self-funded um and has a dedicated fund
 
05:34:24.670 --> 05:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
which any of you who are on the
 
05:34:25.788 --> 05:34:25.798 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds committee would have
 
05:34:27.868 --> 05:34:27.878 align:start position:0%
heard from us at late
 
05:34:30.868 --> 05:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
fall um so pursuant to 3105 Revenue that
 
05:34:33.270 --> 05:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
we receed from licensing fees um is
 
05:34:34.990 --> 05:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
assessed by various boards and
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
commissions and it'll be credited to
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
special dedicated non collapsing fund
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:48.830 --> 05:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated just a quick bullet point
 
05:34:50.590 --> 05:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
on any arpa funds because that was one
 
05:34:51.750 --> 05:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the questions the committee was
 
05:34:53.430 --> 05:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
05:34:57.190 --> 05:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
oplc was um partnered with doit the
 
05:34:58.948 --> 05:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology who
 
05:35:00.948 --> 05:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
technically holds this funding so it is
 
05:35:03.510 --> 05:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
an oplc project but we are not managing
 
05:35:05.750 --> 05:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
that money it is funds from it was
 
05:35:07.990 --> 05:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated to that office so that's
 
05:35:08.000 --> 05:35:09.548 align:start position:0%
appropriated to that office so that's
the

05:35:09.548 --> 05:35:09.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:12.310 --> 05:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
6669 million for the new licensing
 
05:35:14.670 --> 05:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
system implementation uh we have daily
 
05:35:16.868 --> 05:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
calls with them it's um moving forward
 
05:35:20.708 --> 05:35:20.718 align:start position:0%
well we um The Hope is once we've built
 
05:35:24.310 --> 05:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
one board one licensing board I'm not an
 
05:35:25.948 --> 05:35:25.958 align:start position:0%
IT person but it kind of just becomes
 
05:35:27.470 --> 05:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
copy and paste here's the other boards
 
05:35:30.110 --> 05:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
and tweaking around the edges so we are
 
05:35:31.868 --> 05:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
currently planning our go live mandatory
 
05:35:33.628 --> 05:35:33.638 align:start position:0%
date for the first board and then
 
05:35:35.150 --> 05:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
working timelines into that so we're
 
05:35:37.310 --> 05:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
excited about that certainly we'll have
 
05:35:39.430 --> 05:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
that money spent well before the 2026
 
05:35:42.270 --> 05:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
deadline there um we will not be using
 
05:35:45.590 --> 05:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
general funds to replace them um there
 
05:35:47.948 --> 05:35:47.958 align:start position:0%
so no risk there at
 
05:35:50.070 --> 05:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
all um and then we just have our
 
05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
strategic objectives mostly for your
 
05:35:53.948 --> 05:35:53.958 align:start position:0%
information we want to complete that
 
05:35:56.230 --> 05:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
migration continue to establish internal
 
05:35:59.070 --> 05:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
controls I'd like to look at an a public
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
docketing system for the enforcement
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
side of the house again the so our new
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
licensing platform I think we could
 
05:36:07.628 --> 05:36:07.638 align:start position:0%
integrate the two and if a member of the
 
05:36:09.310 --> 05:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
public has made a complaint they would
 
05:36:11.230 --> 05:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
receive a number and they could see the
 
05:36:14.310 --> 05:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
status of that complaint currently um
 
05:36:16.230 --> 05:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
well by law we can't provide any details
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
but I would like to just say yes it's
 
05:36:19.670 --> 05:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
under investigation or it has been
 
05:36:20.990 --> 05:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
dismissed I would like to be able to
 
05:36:23.548 --> 05:36:23.558 align:start position:0%
have that information publicly that's an
 
05:36:26.510 --> 05:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
IT thing it's another um it would be a c
 
05:36:29.590 --> 05:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a capital expense not not in the
 
05:36:31.310 --> 05:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
very technical term but it it would take
 
05:36:33.548 --> 05:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
money and that budgetary consideration
 
05:36:36.868 --> 05:36:36.878 align:start position:0%
is um ongoing and then establishing an
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
in-house status Center so looking at
 
05:36:40.430 --> 05:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce Trends we have a lot of data
 
05:36:42.788 --> 05:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
in the office again not to misuse it or
 
05:36:44.350 --> 05:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
to use it against anyone who does not
 
05:36:46.430 --> 05:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
want their information to be shared but
 
05:36:47.670 --> 05:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
we'd love to be able to provide
 
05:36:49.270 --> 05:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce data that's helpful as the
 
05:36:52.750 --> 05:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:55.628 --> 05:36:55.638 align:start position:0%
forward the last piece here um aside
 
05:36:57.310 --> 05:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
from our contact information is the new
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
positions so their request was again
 
05:37:01.548 --> 05:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
dating back um how many new positions
 
05:37:05.548 --> 05:37:05.558 align:start position:0%
were funded so um Heather put this
 
05:37:07.350 --> 05:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
together for me looking at their request
 
05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
in in the current budget and then the
 
05:37:12.750 --> 05:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
last two uh before that budgeting
 
05:37:16.110 --> 05:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
predates both of us um the records are
 
05:37:17.590 --> 05:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
unclear so we wanted to give you
 
05:37:20.390 --> 05:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
accurate information here um so we
 
05:37:22.990 --> 05:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
created 11 per 11 permanent positions in
 
05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
the 2223 budget that are currently
 
05:37:29.030 --> 05:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
funded created six in the last bium and
 
05:37:30.750 --> 05:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
then requesting eight temporary
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
positions to become permanent in this
 
05:37:34.590 --> 05:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
next budget
 
05:37:37.110 --> 05:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
process the piece to keep in mind there
 
05:37:40.590 --> 05:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
is this the office was only created 10
 
05:37:44.470 --> 05:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
not even 10 years ago and as statutory
 
05:37:46.150 --> 05:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
mandates increased and the
 
05:37:48.310 --> 05:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the office increased
 
05:37:50.110 --> 05:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
the staff were needed to do those things
 
05:37:52.470 --> 05:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
so um the division of enforcement was
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
created therefore we needed people in
 
05:37:56.548 --> 05:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
the division of enforcement they they
 
05:37:59.510 --> 05:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
they weren't there before um it had been
 
05:38:00.990 --> 05:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
that work had been done at the AG's
 
05:38:04.788 --> 05:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
office previously now it was in in house
 
05:38:06.990 --> 05:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
same with it the in to maintain the
 
05:38:08.628 --> 05:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
licensing system for all these boards it
 
05:38:11.310 --> 05:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
was needed to be there um and then again
 
05:38:14.070 --> 05:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
the independent hearing piece of it so
 
05:38:16.628 --> 05:38:16.638 align:start position:0%
just for your context there this is
 
05:38:19.270 --> 05:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
um as those mandates came through
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
providing appropriate Staffing to
 
05:38:23.830 --> 05:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
execute to really to accomplish our
 
05:38:25.510 --> 05:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
mission of fulfilling all statutory
 
05:38:27.990 --> 05:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
mandates there
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
so aside from the headcount which I can
 
05:38:31.590 --> 05:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
get back to the committee on the
 
05:38:34.110 --> 05:38:34.120 align:start position:0%
specific number that we have right now
 
05:38:35.910 --> 05:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
um happy to take any other
 
05:38:39.590 --> 05:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
questions I'll start with one so um I
 
05:38:41.990 --> 05:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
see here that your fiscal year
 
05:38:46.868 --> 05:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
2025 budget is um let's see where is it
 
05:38:48.750 --> 05:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
here about $16
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
million which seems to me on the high
 
05:38:54.110 --> 05:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
side for 120
 
05:38:57.910 --> 05:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
employees um is it all are you spending
 
05:38:59.510 --> 05:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
on something else or maybe it's this
 
05:39:02.510 --> 05:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
computer system or or am I not
 
05:39:05.830 --> 05:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
multiplying right so the the new
 
05:39:08.030 --> 05:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
licensing system is the r money that's
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
kind of that infusion onetime spending
 
05:39:11.310 --> 05:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't be included in that
 
05:39:13.948 --> 05:39:13.958 align:start position:0%
piece there um I would my understanding
 
05:39:15.990 --> 05:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
is about 70% of our office's salaries
 
05:39:19.150 --> 05:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
and benefits so that ends up being
 
05:39:22.590 --> 05:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
2223 million there and then there are
 
05:39:24.670 --> 05:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
other Associated costs um Heather can
 
05:39:26.590 --> 05:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
speak more specifically to the numbers I
 
05:39:28.830 --> 05:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it's particularly
 
05:39:31.350 --> 05:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
high but it also includes another data
 
05:39:33.390 --> 05:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
cated fund that we have which is the PHP
 
05:39:36.270 --> 05:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
program and that is approximately uh a
 
05:39:37.990 --> 05:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
couple about a million
 
05:39:39.628 --> 05:39:39.638 align:start position:0%
so that's included in that budget figure
 
05:39:42.310 --> 05:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
and additionally our rent uh figure is
 
05:39:44.430 --> 05:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
included in that which is predominantly
 
05:39:47.390 --> 05:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
high I can get that exact figure for you
 
05:39:50.548 --> 05:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
okay yeah maybe we'll you'll give us
 
05:39:55.150 --> 05:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
some more detailed uh um statements okay
 
05:39:59.350 --> 05:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
good so the p i representative Lee thank
 
05:40:03.190 --> 05:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman welcome so uh two years
 
05:40:06.150 --> 05:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
ago the past director submitted a number
 
05:40:08.708 --> 05:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
of policy board changes which many of
 
05:40:11.310 --> 05:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
them were not met with a lot of
 
05:40:13.868 --> 05:40:13.878 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm by the finance committee do
 
05:40:16.830 --> 05:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
you plan to bring forth a lot of changes
 
05:40:19.708 --> 05:40:19.718 align:start position:0%
in this coming budget
 
05:40:24.708 --> 05:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
cycle um I know I my position has been
 
05:40:25.868 --> 05:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
and actually I think many
 
05:40:27.270 --> 05:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
representatives can say I said can you
 
05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
give me a year to just do what you've
 
05:40:30.910 --> 05:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
asked me to do like what's in the law
 
05:40:32.670 --> 05:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
can we can we roll it out can I get
 
05:40:35.110 --> 05:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
through this rules lag can my processes
 
05:40:36.670 --> 05:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
catch up and let's let's just do what's
 
05:40:39.270 --> 05:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
in the law now and then let's see what
 
05:40:40.868 --> 05:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
needs to happen do we need to change it
 
05:40:43.430 --> 05:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
again so uh I'm saying please send as
 
05:40:45.548 --> 05:40:45.558 align:start position:0%
little as possible my way I'm not asking
 
05:40:47.868 --> 05:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
for any even things that we're seeing
 
05:40:49.230 --> 05:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
that we're saying maybe this is a kind
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
of a cleanup technical Bill trying to
 
05:40:53.548 --> 05:40:53.558 align:start position:0%
get it to drive uh I have told my staff
 
05:40:55.350 --> 05:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
put it on a list we're not asking for it
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
this year I I'm uh we don't need any
 
05:41:00.990 --> 05:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
more work presently yeah further
 
05:41:04.230 --> 05:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman thank you uh do you
 
05:41:06.910 --> 05:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
have any fee increases in your budget
 
05:41:08.430 --> 05:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
obviously so you don't run on General
 
05:41:10.788 --> 05:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
funds you run on the fees you collect do
 
05:41:12.430 --> 05:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
you have any proposed increases or are
 
05:41:14.510 --> 05:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
you going to leave the fees
 
05:41:16.948 --> 05:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
flat I can't say definitively because
 
05:41:19.030 --> 05:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're still in the budget process and
 
05:41:22.430 --> 05:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
because my fees because I'm entirely fee
 
05:41:25.030 --> 05:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
funded whatever I'm authorized to budget
 
05:41:26.948 --> 05:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
I will have to raise in fees to have the
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
balanced budget there so I I don't know
 
05:41:30.628 --> 05:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
what that's going to look like I can't
 
05:41:32.468 --> 05:41:32.478 align:start position:0%
give a definitive answer I'm going to
 
05:41:33.628 --> 05:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
ask if you would allow me to have
 
05:41:35.948 --> 05:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
Heather just talk through the the
 
05:41:37.548 --> 05:41:37.558 align:start position:0%
statutory mandate that we have for
 
05:41:39.270 --> 05:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
setting the fees appropriately so you
 
05:41:40.708 --> 05:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
kind of get a sense of the formula that
 
05:41:42.468 --> 05:41:42.478 align:start position:0%
we use when we're making these
 
05:41:44.548 --> 05:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
considerations so if if that's okay with
 
05:41:46.030 --> 05:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
you to give a little
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
context so the agency is not authorized
 
05:41:51.628 --> 05:41:51.638 align:start position:0%
to collect more than 12 125% of the
 
05:41:55.548 --> 05:41:55.558 align:start position:0%
board expenses so what we do is we take
 
05:41:58.430 --> 05:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
all indirect costs divide them amongst
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
the lensy account for each board and
 
05:42:02.750 --> 05:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
then attribute any direct cost to the
 
05:42:05.150 --> 05:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
board so mechanical inspectors for
 
05:42:07.150 --> 05:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
example are attributed directly just to
 
05:42:09.430 --> 05:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
to the mechanical board from there we
 
05:42:11.788 --> 05:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
determine the ratio and then make
 
05:42:13.708 --> 05:42:13.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate adjustments on the fee
 
05:42:16.788 --> 05:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:19.468 --> 05:42:19.478 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr
 
05:42:22.628 --> 05:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
05:42:26.430 --> 05:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
I have a few questions um do is there a
 
05:42:29.430 --> 05:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
list of the license fees that are
 
05:42:32.948 --> 05:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
charged and then um how do they compare
 
05:42:34.868 --> 05:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
to other states are they pretty
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
consistent or is there a real Delta
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
between certain States the the current
 
05:42:44.628 --> 05:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
license fees are largely in one place
 
05:42:48.468 --> 05:42:48.478 align:start position:0%
which would be the the oplc rule so PLC
 
05:42:50.750 --> 05:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
1002 is the chapter that you could look
 
05:42:54.350 --> 05:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
at it has just a grid not every fee is
 
05:42:55.948 --> 05:42:55.958 align:start position:0%
included in there because there are some
 
05:42:57.510 --> 05:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
that we have not yet engaged in rule
 
05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
making to set a fee for newer boards
 
05:43:01.750 --> 05:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
that have come over or newer license
 
05:43:04.468 --> 05:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
types that were created in statute
 
05:43:06.750 --> 05:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
additionally um actually that's part of
 
05:43:07.868 --> 05:43:07.878 align:start position:0%
what we're working through with this
 
05:43:10.270 --> 05:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
whole the whole budget process now is
 
05:43:13.350 --> 05:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
that the office has newly the the
 
05:43:15.230 --> 05:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to set those fees is
 
05:43:16.868 --> 05:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
now newly with the office it was
 
05:43:19.270 --> 05:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
previously with the boards and so now
 
05:43:20.910 --> 05:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's clear that the office sets all of
 
05:43:23.390 --> 05:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
those fees so there are some currently
 
05:43:25.270 --> 05:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
that are in other parts of rule in other
 
05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
chapters with boards and the idea would
 
05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
be whatever ends up being filed would
 
05:43:31.910 --> 05:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
all be in one place in those 10002s you
 
05:43:33.390 --> 05:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
get a pretty good sense if you look at
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
it now it the plan is for it to be
 
05:43:38.468 --> 05:43:38.478 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in the proposal that we're
 
05:43:41.150 --> 05:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
the role that we file okay and how do
 
05:43:42.990 --> 05:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
those compare with other states because
 
05:43:45.150 --> 05:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
the the the fees from what I heard you
 
05:43:47.948 --> 05:43:47.958 align:start position:0%
say the fees are set really driven by
 
05:43:50.708 --> 05:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
the expenses of the particular board so
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
how do those expenses compare with you
 
05:43:56.788 --> 05:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
know other states do they have the same
 
05:43:59.310 --> 05:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
level of expenses more or less I know
 
05:44:01.150 --> 05:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
Heather's team has done some analysis on
 
05:44:02.548 --> 05:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
this I we probably won't speak to
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
specifics but I'll let her give you a
 
05:44:05.788 --> 05:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
general sense if she has that on the top
 
05:44:08.670 --> 05:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
of mind I know for some specific boards
 
05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
like Board of Medicine we are
 
05:44:12.670 --> 05:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
substantially lower however our Board of
 
05:44:16.468 --> 05:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
Medicine uh is well over their ratio uh
 
05:44:18.270 --> 05:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
but we do have a comprehensive list if
 
05:44:20.270 --> 05:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
you would like we can Bo that as well
 
05:44:22.350 --> 05:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and then uh a couple
 
05:44:24.708 --> 05:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
other questions you mentioned that you
 
05:44:27.670 --> 05:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
have some positions open um what type of
 
05:44:30.310 --> 05:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
positions are
 
05:44:32.868 --> 05:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
they really spans the agency there
 
05:44:35.830 --> 05:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
silver vacancies with our LSR or our
 
05:44:39.030 --> 05:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
licensing um service representative so
 
05:44:40.350 --> 05:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
that those would be the people on phones
 
05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
and emails and issuing licenses license
 
05:44:45.468 --> 05:44:45.478 align:start position:0%
clerk there um I have a an attorney
 
05:44:48.150 --> 05:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
position vacant I
 
05:44:51.868 --> 05:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
have um the yes an investigator position
 
05:44:57.510 --> 05:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
vacant an enforcement I have um
 
05:45:00.270 --> 05:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
a yes our public information
 
05:45:02.670 --> 05:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
officer we have we have some other
 
05:45:06.110 --> 05:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
positions that are um proposed to be
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
unfunded so those are vacant obviously
 
05:45:09.670 --> 05:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to fill them
 
05:45:11.030 --> 05:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
right now if we're not planning to fund
 
05:45:14.030 --> 05:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
to fund them in going forward um some
 
05:45:16.150 --> 05:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
board administrator so again that team
 
05:45:18.030 --> 05:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
that supports each board there so it
 
05:45:20.310 --> 05:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
really kind of runs across the the whole
 
05:45:22.590 --> 05:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
piece of it through all divisions yeah I
 
05:45:23.708 --> 05:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
was just interested if there more
 
05:45:26.150 --> 05:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
professional positions entry level but
 
05:45:28.190 --> 05:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
and then my final question is you
 
05:45:30.430 --> 05:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned um the the number of
 
05:45:33.350 --> 05:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
complaints you get are those really
 
05:45:37.150 --> 05:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
geared at one particular um occupation
 
05:45:38.708 --> 05:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
or they is that pretty much the
 
05:45:41.628 --> 05:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
complaints spread across many of them
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
the primary two the largest two
 
05:45:45.628 --> 05:45:45.638 align:start position:0%
complaints would be medicine and Board
 
05:45:47.548 --> 05:45:47.558 align:start position:0%
of Nursing oh okay thank you those would
 
05:45:51.310 --> 05:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
be the two highest by far yes all right
 
05:45:53.750 --> 05:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
yep thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:45:59.030 --> 05:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
coming in um I get the fact that you
 
05:46:01.708 --> 05:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
don't want us to give you more work to
 
05:46:05.468 --> 05:46:05.478 align:start position:0%
do um is there things that are in
 
05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
statute already
 
05:46:11.150 --> 05:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
that you would like to see removed from
 
05:46:13.510 --> 05:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
statute that you know basically you you
 
05:46:14.948 --> 05:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
really don't understand the the
 
05:46:17.468 --> 05:46:17.478 align:start position:0%
rationale reason for it it's just
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:25.150 --> 05:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
whenever you know I gu I guess I'm not
 
05:46:27.468 --> 05:46:27.478 align:start position:0%
asking for you to run down a list but I
 
05:46:29.670 --> 05:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
mean my point is you know if there are
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
things like that I think that would be
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
useful for us to know because maybe we
 
05:46:37.150 --> 05:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
can help you out okay I think what I'd
 
05:46:40.670 --> 05:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
like to say is uh I really um having
 
05:46:43.990 --> 05:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
served in the legislature and on the
 
05:46:45.390 --> 05:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
governor's staff with the former
 
05:46:46.708 --> 05:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
Administration and then currently in
 
05:46:50.230 --> 05:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
this role um I just really understand
 
05:46:53.230 --> 05:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not in a policy-making role I just I
 
05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
implement the law that you give me um so
 
05:46:57.190 --> 05:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
I may have a lot of personal opinions
 
05:46:59.670 --> 05:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
about what I think should be happening I
 
05:47:02.030 --> 05:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
might have some ideas for operational um
 
05:47:04.510 --> 05:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
consolidation and support there but my
 
05:47:06.390 --> 05:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
position really is I I will implement
 
05:47:08.190 --> 05:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
the law that you give me whether or not
 
05:47:10.030 --> 05:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
I think that's the way that it should be
 
05:47:11.868 --> 05:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
so I I do hesitate to make a policy
 
05:47:14.150 --> 05:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation just out of Defence for
 
05:47:17.390 --> 05:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
the the separation of the branches which
 
05:47:19.590 --> 05:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
I know is not satisfying to you but I I
 
05:47:22.030 --> 05:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
really do hesitate to to do that in this
 
05:47:27.270 --> 05:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
seat okay um I guess I guess oh am am I
 
05:47:31.150 --> 05:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
all right yeah so um representative lean
 
05:47:33.070 --> 05:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
was out of the room when we said we'll
 
05:47:35.510 --> 05:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
allow a little back and forth just to
 
05:47:38.990 --> 05:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
save time I was that's right yeah yeah
 
05:47:41.548 --> 05:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
yeah so you know but if it gets to be
 
05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
too much I'll I will you know impose my
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
will or so the the um push the button
 
05:47:52.430 --> 05:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
the the the um this you mentioned that
 
05:47:54.990 --> 05:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
the statute sets the maximum you can
 
05:47:56.868 --> 05:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
charge is at
 
05:47:59.468 --> 05:47:59.478 align:start position:0%
125% is that enough does that give does
 
05:48:01.430 --> 05:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
that create problems where you where you
 
05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
end up um you know having to absorb a
 
05:48:07.548 --> 05:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
cost that you shouldn't have
 
05:48:10.628 --> 05:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
to what we're currently evalu there are
 
05:48:12.868 --> 05:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
like I mentioned there are some licenses
 
05:48:14.510 --> 05:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
that by law we have to issue but we have
 
05:48:16.548 --> 05:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
not engaged in Ru making yet to charge a
 
05:48:20.830 --> 05:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
fee I I think there's broad consensus
 
05:48:23.430 --> 05:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
that it does cost some amount of money
 
05:48:25.468 --> 05:48:25.478 align:start position:0%
to process them so I don't anticipate a
 
05:48:27.350 --> 05:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
challenge with setting that
 
05:48:28.830 --> 05:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
appropriately for the credentials that
 
05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
do not yet have a fee established from
 
05:48:33.230 --> 05:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
the office the the challenge becomes for
 
05:48:36.430 --> 05:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
us and where it's I mean it is not a
 
05:48:37.948 --> 05:48:37.958 align:start position:0%
simple proposal because it's so
 
05:48:40.510 --> 05:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
contingent on the budget is to say
 
05:48:43.030 --> 05:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
whatever the bottom line amount is
 
05:48:44.990 --> 05:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
anything that is not a direct cost is
 
05:48:47.070 --> 05:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
divided by the boards the challenge for
 
05:48:49.670 --> 05:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
us is to say we don't we we don't want
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
to go over
 
05:48:54.030 --> 05:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
125% but we also don't want to be under
 
05:48:56.750 --> 05:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
100% And I think that that is the piece
 
05:48:58.110 --> 05:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
right now that we're looking at how do
 
05:49:00.830 --> 05:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
you how do you level that out to say if
 
05:49:00.840 --> 05:49:01.628 align:start position:0%
you how do you level that out to say if
a

05:49:01.628 --> 05:49:01.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
board um if the amount attributed to a
 
05:49:07.868 --> 05:49:07.878 align:start position:0%
board is not covered by the fees from
 
05:49:11.430 --> 05:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
that board um what is compliance with
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
that one that doesn't set necessarily a
 
05:49:15.468 --> 05:49:15.478 align:start position:0%
minimum but then you do end up having
 
05:49:18.190 --> 05:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
those subsidies potentially from other
 
05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
boards and and what does that look like
 
05:49:22.390 --> 05:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
and um that that's something we're
 
05:49:24.548 --> 05:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
actively looking at and again the the
 
05:49:27.150 --> 05:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
the budget is going to determine what
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
those fees how that looks if that makes
 
05:49:31.628 --> 05:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
sense I'm I don't want to be koi with
 
05:49:34.030 --> 05:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
you I'm just just trying to be straight
 
05:49:38.468 --> 05:49:38.478 align:start position:0%
that leveling that out is is a challenge
 
05:49:41.548 --> 05:49:41.558 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Camal thank you Mr
 
05:49:43.910 --> 05:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
chair for the sake of efficiency are
 
05:49:45.990 --> 05:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
there any commissions that you're on or
 
05:49:49.110 --> 05:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
that your staff attends that really you
 
05:49:52.110 --> 05:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
feel not worthwhile and it could save
 
05:49:55.110 --> 05:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
your yourself or your staff some time
 
05:49:57.628 --> 05:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
what commissions that you you've been
 
05:49:59.788 --> 05:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
assigned to attend
 
05:50:04.430 --> 05:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
yes I think uh director Kelly is on a
 
05:50:07.070 --> 05:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
few I think they are more study
 
05:50:08.430 --> 05:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
committee in nature they're not
 
05:50:11.350 --> 05:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
longstanding like standing committees I
 
05:50:13.910 --> 05:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
am currently appointed to the it Council
 
05:50:17.150 --> 05:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
but that's my only role there I'm trying
 
05:50:19.468 --> 05:50:19.478 align:start position:0%
to think off the top of my head I don't
 
05:50:20.910 --> 05:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
think I have any
 
05:50:23.910 --> 05:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
standing like long committees I think
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
that mostly it's the
 
05:50:27.708 --> 05:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
shortterm what a couple months or like
 
05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
the one-year study committee that we're
 
05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
looking at I don't think we have any
 
05:50:33.310 --> 05:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
those like ex official obligations at
 
05:50:33.320 --> 05:50:34.230 align:start position:0%
those like ex official obligations at
this

05:50:34.230 --> 05:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
point thank you we're just we're we're
 
05:50:39.350 --> 05:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
asking that question of every Department
 
05:50:41.548 --> 05:50:41.558 align:start position:0%
because we are on a mission to try to
 
05:50:43.590 --> 05:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of commissions so
 
05:50:45.468 --> 05:50:45.478 align:start position:0%
again if I didn't expect you to give a
 
05:50:48.430 --> 05:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
straight answer but if you do think of
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
it uh let the chairman know and we will
 
05:50:53.110 --> 05:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
do everything we can to eliminate that
 
05:50:54.830 --> 05:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
that commission as a person who worked
 
05:50:56.110 --> 05:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
on boards and commissions appointments
 
05:51:01.350 --> 05:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:04.590 --> 05:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
goal representative Griffin I wonder if
 
05:51:07.070 --> 05:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
you could go into a little more
 
05:51:08.628 --> 05:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
who sets the
 
05:51:11.350 --> 05:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
standards and what typically are they
 
05:51:14.948 --> 05:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
for a profession in other words uh does
 
05:51:18.350 --> 05:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
a profession have a an exam a person has
 
05:51:21.750 --> 05:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
to pass to get licenses is that the
 
05:51:26.750 --> 05:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
typical thing or or uh are you just a
 
05:51:30.230 --> 05:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
administrator that gives a license out
 
05:51:33.270 --> 05:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
or do you get involved in that exam
 
05:51:36.150 --> 05:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
process oh yeah for any profession and
 
05:51:39.070 --> 05:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
how does it work basically yeah happy to
 
05:51:40.708 --> 05:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
get into that a little bit I may give
 
05:51:42.468 --> 05:51:42.478 align:start position:0%
you a high level and defer to um
 
05:51:44.910 --> 05:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
director Kelly here but um it really
 
05:51:47.510 --> 05:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
does run the gamut so among those 57
 
05:51:49.590 --> 05:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
boards we have about 200 different
 
05:51:53.670 --> 05:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
license types so it really varies widely
 
05:51:57.190 --> 05:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
right so between an MD and a pharmacy
 
05:51:59.230 --> 05:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
tech and an LNA and a landscape
 
05:52:01.510 --> 05:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
architect and an electrician it really
 
05:52:03.190 --> 05:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
is widely different I think the thing
 
05:52:06.030 --> 05:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's uniform is that these boards that
 
05:52:07.708 --> 05:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
have Prof profession members of the
 
05:52:09.548 --> 05:52:09.558 align:start position:0%
profession on them are the ones that are
 
05:52:12.430 --> 05:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
setting the standard um the requirements
 
05:52:16.590 --> 05:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
for that license many do have exams um
 
05:52:18.868 --> 05:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
that are administered typically we have
 
05:52:20.830 --> 05:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
a third-party vendor that administers
 
05:52:23.590 --> 05:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
that exam uh that people can take
 
05:52:26.670 --> 05:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
there's a difference to some boards
 
05:52:29.628 --> 05:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
require people to apply and be approved
 
05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
to sit for an exam then they can take
 
05:52:33.590 --> 05:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
the exam if they pass then they are
 
05:52:36.110 --> 05:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
licensed others their application you
 
05:52:38.430 --> 05:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
take your exam you say hey I passed with
 
05:52:40.430 --> 05:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
your application and then that's just
 
05:52:43.468 --> 05:52:43.478 align:start position:0%
included in the packet so the processes
 
05:52:46.868 --> 05:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
are still um widely varied by profession
 
05:52:48.910 --> 05:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to let director Kelly
 
05:52:50.190 --> 05:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
if I missed anything that's really
 
05:52:52.788 --> 05:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
crucial on that think we're pretty close
 
05:52:54.708 --> 05:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
so if you had a specific profession in
 
05:52:56.670 --> 05:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
mind I probably couldn't off the top of
 
05:52:59.390 --> 05:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
my head get the rundown for you but I I
 
05:53:01.430 --> 05:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm trying to get at is these
 
05:53:04.510 --> 05:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
individual boards as you say differ
 
05:53:07.430 --> 05:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
greatly do they give you a list of those
 
05:53:09.510 --> 05:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
who were qualified and then you issue
 
05:53:14.110 --> 05:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
the license no they set the standards in
 
05:53:17.310 --> 05:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
Rule and they the standards are set to
 
05:53:20.030 --> 05:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
be objective and then for those
 
05:53:21.430 --> 05:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
applications we have a universal
 
05:53:23.110 --> 05:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
application for the general information
 
05:53:24.830 --> 05:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
that no matter who you are we need this
 
05:53:27.030 --> 05:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
information and then boards can have
 
05:53:29.990 --> 05:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
what is called an addendum or additional
 
05:53:32.948 --> 05:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
profession specific questions other
 
05:53:37.310 --> 05:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
requirements and basically the the the
 
05:53:39.548 --> 05:53:39.558 align:start position:0%
clerk the licensed clerk looks and say
 
05:53:42.868 --> 05:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
did they meet the criteria yes or no so
 
05:53:44.548 --> 05:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
the boards are not evaluating the
 
05:53:46.390 --> 05:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
individual applications unless there is
 
05:53:48.788 --> 05:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
a question if it's unclear whether the
 
05:53:50.190 --> 05:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
criteria was
 
05:53:52.788 --> 05:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
meant does that does that
 
05:53:58.750 --> 05:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:01.350 --> 05:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah I don't don't see too many
 
05:54:04.548 --> 05:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
other questions um yeah I'd just like to
 
05:54:07.948 --> 05:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
get more detail of um employees and
 
05:54:11.190 --> 05:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
costs other costs right so more detailed
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and then I guess we will let
 
05:54:15.548 --> 05:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
you go all right thank you so much thank
 
05:54:18.310 --> 05:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
you very much have a great afternoon all
 
05:54:21.788 --> 05:54:21.798 align:start position:0%
right so um I guess our next one is
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission at 3:15 so we'll
 
05:54:35.310 --> 05:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:35.320 --> 05:55:05.310 align:start position:0%
 
then

06:13:04.110 --> 06:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:04.120 --> 06:13:34.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:13:34.030 --> 06:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:34.040 --> 06:14:04.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:14:04.030 --> 06:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:04.040 --> 06:14:34.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:14:34.030 --> 06:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:34.040 --> 06:15:03.948 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:15:03.948 --> 06:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:03.958 --> 06:15:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:15:33.910 --> 06:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:17.590 --> 06:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to explain I I handed
 
06:16:22.230 --> 06:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
out a spreadsheet to you that you might
 
06:16:26.708 --> 06:16:26.718 align:start position:0%
find useful um this is sort of the whole
 
06:16:31.070 --> 06:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing budget at a glance okay so it
 
06:16:35.510 --> 06:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh has fiscal year 2019 adjusted
 
06:16:39.670 --> 06:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
authorized and fiscal year 2025 adjusted
 
06:16:42.628 --> 06:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
authorized both for there's one column
 
06:16:45.430 --> 06:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
for General and education funds and then
 
06:16:47.750 --> 06:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's another column for total funds
 
06:16:50.548 --> 06:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
so what's interesting about it is so
 
06:16:52.670 --> 06:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
this is a sort of ongoing stuff it
 
06:16:55.548 --> 06:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't have legislative specials that
 
06:16:58.350 --> 06:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
show up in House Bill 2 but this is kind
 
06:17:00.910 --> 06:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
of the basics of of what each agency
 
06:17:04.270 --> 06:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
does and you can also see the the
 
06:17:07.590 --> 06:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
percent change over that period of time
 
06:17:09.390 --> 06:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
and by way of comparison if you if you
 
06:17:11.868 --> 06:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
go to the back page you see that the
 
06:17:16.708 --> 06:17:16.718 align:start position:0%
state totals are up by about a third 32%
 
06:17:21.548 --> 06:17:21.558 align:start position:0%
33% here on the bottom line um over
 
06:17:24.510 --> 06:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
those six years but if you look at
 
06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
inflation over that period of time it's
 
06:17:30.270 --> 06:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
about it's 25% according to the feds and
 
06:17:32.670 --> 06:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
then we've had about a 4% population
 
06:17:35.948 --> 06:17:35.958 align:start position:0%
growth so you know it's not that
 
06:17:38.190 --> 06:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
outrageous but it you know it may be a
 
06:17:41.390 --> 06:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
little over what you might expect just
 
06:17:43.708 --> 06:17:43.718 align:start position:0%
from those two things right instead of
 
06:17:46.390 --> 06:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
29% it's more like 32
 
06:17:50.510 --> 06:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
33% so um but there's lots of individual
 
06:17:53.150 --> 06:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
agencies that are either way up or way
 
06:17:56.468 --> 06:17:56.478 align:start position:0%
down and so that's what this tells you
 
06:17:59.788 --> 06:17:59.798 align:start position:0%
is is kind of where if we have to look
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
for savings where we might look for so
 
06:18:05.350 --> 06:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative MS
 
06:18:08.510 --> 06:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
um but I I think you know just looking
 
06:18:11.150 --> 06:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
at it quickly I mean I I think you have
 
06:18:13.750 --> 06:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
to be careful when you're doing the the
 
06:18:17.110 --> 06:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
um comparisons year-over-year by agency
 
06:18:18.430 --> 06:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
because I mean look at the first one
 
06:18:20.670 --> 06:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
executive department it went from 40
 
06:18:25.468 --> 06:18:25.478 align:start position:0%
million in 19 to 3.6 million in 25 so
 
06:18:27.110 --> 06:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
yes I'm guessing that that's because
 
06:18:28.548 --> 06:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
there was some money moved around some
 
06:18:30.390 --> 06:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
other places you're right that that was
 
06:18:33.468 --> 06:18:33.478 align:start position:0%
a reorganization so yes in some cases
 
06:18:36.190 --> 06:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
like that you do have to understand that
 
06:18:39.150 --> 06:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
some big thing moved out of this area
 
06:18:42.190 --> 06:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
and into some other area but um if you
 
06:18:44.350 --> 06:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
have questions about that LBA can can
 
06:18:46.590 --> 06:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
answer them but for most of them it
 
06:18:49.948 --> 06:18:49.958 align:start position:0%
that's not the case yeah all right uh
 
06:18:52.390 --> 06:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for coming commissioner
 
06:18:53.708 --> 06:18:53.718 align:start position:0%
please introduce
 
06:18:56.590 --> 06:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
yourself thank you Mr chairman uh for
 
06:18:58.430 --> 06:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Joseph mikica I'm the
 
06:18:59.990 --> 06:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
chairman of the New Hampshire Liquor
 
06:19:03.310 --> 06:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
Commission and with me is our CFO Tina
 
06:19:07.468 --> 06:19:07.478 align:start position:0%
Demir uh I I think this this packet
 
06:19:09.830 --> 06:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensively answers the questions
 
06:19:12.468 --> 06:19:12.478 align:start position:0%
that you sent to us so we'll just get
 
06:19:14.350 --> 06:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
started uh we'll give you a little
 
06:19:16.948 --> 06:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
overview first that New Hampshire is one
 
06:19:19.990 --> 06:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
of 17 controll jurisdictions in the
 
06:19:22.868 --> 06:19:22.878 align:start position:0%
country uh and those are in the darker
 
06:19:25.510 --> 06:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
color the three- tier system as it's
 
06:19:29.628 --> 06:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
broken down um I won't bore you with the
 
06:19:31.628 --> 06:19:31.638 align:start position:0%
details but it's a system that's been in
 
06:19:34.190 --> 06:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
place since prohibition and it works
 
06:19:35.670 --> 06:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
very well commissioner could I just ask
 
06:19:37.708 --> 06:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
on the first one what are the polka dots
 
06:19:41.590 --> 06:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
on Alaska Minnesota Etc yeah oh there's
 
06:19:43.230 --> 06:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
usually a note on the bottom those are
 
06:19:46.070 --> 06:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
the control counties that are within
 
06:19:46.080 --> 06:19:47.628 align:start position:0%
the control counties that are within
those

06:19:47.628 --> 06:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:19:50.830 --> 06:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
States so we have the 17 jurisdictions
 
06:19:53.750 --> 06:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
and then those counties within those
 
06:19:56.788 --> 06:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
states of Minnesota South Dakota and
 
06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
Alaska than you're
 
06:20:02.750 --> 06:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
welcome so on page four we'll get to the
 
06:20:04.788 --> 06:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
value of the three- tier system in the
 
06:20:06.590 --> 06:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
biggest one the biggest value that we
 
06:20:08.830 --> 06:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
feel of the three- tier system is the
 
06:20:11.430 --> 06:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
product tracking which present prevents
 
06:20:13.990 --> 06:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
the sale of Tainted or counterfeit
 
06:20:15.310 --> 06:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol and that's something you don't
 
06:20:17.350 --> 06:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of in the United States and
 
06:20:19.510 --> 06:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's because of the three- tier system
 
06:20:21.030 --> 06:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
you certainly don't hear a lot about it
 
06:20:22.390 --> 06:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
in control
 
06:20:27.230 --> 06:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions but as of 20 in 2024 1,200
 
06:20:30.708 --> 06:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
people were affected by methanol tainted
 
06:20:34.430 --> 06:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol and 400 people died and in the
 
06:20:36.230 --> 06:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
past Last 5 Years
 
06:20:39.030 --> 06:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
11,800 people have been affected and
 
06:20:41.270 --> 06:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
4500 people have died and those are
 
06:20:43.548 --> 06:20:43.558 align:start position:0%
worldwide figures again something you
 
06:20:46.110 --> 06:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
don't see here in the United States very
 
06:20:49.590 --> 06:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
much but it does happen uh unfortunately
 
06:20:53.868 --> 06:20:53.878 align:start position:0%
in in the world itself in the country
 
06:20:57.788 --> 06:20:57.798 align:start position:0%
so on page five competition just a quick
 
06:21:00.270 --> 06:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
history in 2011 governor Patrick signed
 
06:21:02.510 --> 06:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
a bill increasing the number of liquor
 
06:21:05.390 --> 06:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
licenses that were allowed to be held
 
06:21:07.788 --> 06:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
held by one person in the state for
 
06:21:09.150 --> 06:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
years and years and years in
 
06:21:11.468 --> 06:21:11.478 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts there been three licenses
 
06:21:13.468 --> 06:21:13.478 align:start position:0%
so it never attracted any large
 
06:21:16.548 --> 06:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
retailers into the state uh when he made
 
06:21:19.030 --> 06:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
that change uh you saw Total Wine move
 
06:21:21.390 --> 06:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
into the state and again just quickly
 
06:21:23.590 --> 06:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're the nation's largest independent
 
06:21:26.150 --> 06:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
Wine and Spirits retailer they're owned
 
06:21:28.830 --> 06:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
by Two Brothers uh it's privately owned
 
06:21:32.590 --> 06:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
they have 277 stores in 29 States and
 
06:21:35.430 --> 06:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
11,000 employees and since since
 
06:21:38.708 --> 06:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
2014 they have opened 12 stores in New
 
06:21:41.430 --> 06:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
England uh for in Connecticut eight in
 
06:21:43.548 --> 06:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and that's very important
 
06:21:46.590 --> 06:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
to us because 25% of our business comes
 
06:21:50.270 --> 06:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts 50% uh crossborder
 
06:21:52.628 --> 06:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
sales here in the
 
06:21:55.830 --> 06:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
State uh on page
 
06:21:58.350 --> 06:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
six it's just uh some national and
 
06:22:00.190 --> 06:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
Global figures impacting beverage
 
06:22:02.230 --> 06:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales there's a number of things
 
06:22:04.750 --> 06:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
that are uh we're seeing in the market
 
06:22:08.110 --> 06:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
but the biggest thing is uh since
 
06:22:11.670 --> 06:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
2023 there's been a 2% decline in
 
06:22:13.948 --> 06:22:13.958 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales in the United States that
 
06:22:17.468 --> 06:22:17.478 align:start position:0%
was the first decline in alcohol sales
 
06:22:20.990 --> 06:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
in the United States in 31 years so
 
06:22:24.628 --> 06:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
between 23 24 and 25 they're expecting
 
06:22:27.590 --> 06:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales in the United States to be
 
06:22:27.600 --> 06:22:29.510 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales in the United States to be
down

06:22:29.510 --> 06:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
down
 
06:22:32.948 --> 06:22:32.958 align:start position:0%
5.9% and some of the reasons why we'll
 
06:22:36.590 --> 06:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
get into in the next couple couple of
 
06:22:40.070 --> 06:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
slides so National and Global factors in
 
06:22:45.270 --> 06:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
impacting alcohol sales uh so for uh
 
06:22:47.270 --> 06:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
number two for the first time in the
 
06:22:49.230 --> 06:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
United States more Americans are using
 
06:22:52.150 --> 06:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
marijuana on a daily basis or nearly
 
06:22:54.990 --> 06:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
daily basis than alcohol there's a big
 
06:22:57.548 --> 06:22:57.558 align:start position:0%
Neo prohibitionist mve in in the United
 
06:23:00.030 --> 06:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
States and the potential upcoming
 
06:23:01.670 --> 06:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
tariffs are something that we have to
 
06:23:03.990 --> 06:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
take into consideration that could be a
 
06:23:05.868 --> 06:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
mix book blessing because it could help
 
06:23:08.548 --> 06:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
some of the US producers of wine and
 
06:23:10.830 --> 06:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
spirits there happens to be a glut of
 
06:23:12.868 --> 06:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
wine in
 
06:23:15.788 --> 06:23:15.798 align:start position:0%
California uh
 
06:23:19.110 --> 06:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
Tennessee uh Kentucky Alabama now we're
 
06:23:22.310 --> 06:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
experiencing a glut of brown spirits and
 
06:23:25.070 --> 06:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
brown Foreman the parent company of Jack
 
06:23:29.868 --> 06:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
Daniels on Tuesday laid off 700
 
06:23:33.708 --> 06:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
employees uh so again on page eight some
 
06:23:36.788 --> 06:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
of the impact of cannabis Again The
 
06:23:38.910 --> 06:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is not for or against
 
06:23:40.510 --> 06:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis but it is something that
 
06:23:42.948 --> 06:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
affects our business and we're seeing
 
06:23:44.070 --> 06:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
06:23:48.628 --> 06:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
355 licensed retailers in Massachusetts
 
06:23:53.030 --> 06:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
218 licensed retailers in Maine and 79
 
06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
licensed retailers in Vermont and the
 
06:24:00.390 --> 06:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
corresponding revenues and taxes that go
 
06:24:04.750 --> 06:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:06.468 --> 06:24:06.478 align:start position:0%
we'll move to page 10 where we'll give
 
06:24:08.590 --> 06:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
you a quick operational
 
06:24:34.510 --> 06:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:36.670 --> 06:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
numbers you'll see the exact numbers
 
06:24:39.990 --> 06:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
that are given to those funds uh we are
 
06:24:43.270 --> 06:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
govern governed under RSA
 
06:24:46.190 --> 06:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
1763 and you'll see what governs the
 
06:24:48.750 --> 06:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
commission and the responsibilities of
 
06:24:50.390 --> 06:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
06:24:54.510 --> 06:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
itself on page 11 a quick organizational
 
06:24:57.830 --> 06:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
structure I'm sorry sure on this page I
 
06:25:00.830 --> 06:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
don't see uh the amount transferred to
 
06:25:03.510 --> 06:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
the general funds uh well when Tina goes
 
06:25:05.830 --> 06:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
through the numbers you'll the end yeah
 
06:25:08.270 --> 06:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
we'll go through everything there y
 
06:25:10.830 --> 06:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the question
 
06:25:14.030 --> 06:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
on page 11 you'll see the organizational
 
06:25:16.070 --> 06:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
structure of the commission and the
 
06:25:19.070 --> 06:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
full-time uh positions represented in
 
06:25:20.868 --> 06:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
the office of the commission the
 
06:25:23.270 --> 06:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement the division of
 
06:25:24.868 --> 06:25:24.878 align:start position:0%
administration and the division of
 
06:25:28.150 --> 06:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
marketing those 285 positions in the
 
06:25:30.868 --> 06:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
division of marketing also include all
 
06:25:32.830 --> 06:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
the full-time employees that are in the
 
06:25:35.910 --> 06:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
outlets as well
 
06:25:39.030 --> 06:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh so the responsibilities of the office
 
06:25:40.948 --> 06:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
of the commission the division of
 
06:25:42.548 --> 06:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement the division of
 
06:25:44.468 --> 06:25:44.478 align:start position:0%
administration and marketing are as
 
06:25:47.110 --> 06:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
follows on page
 
06:25:51.670 --> 06:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
12 on page 13 we've uh started we've uh
 
06:25:53.830 --> 06:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
launched an NextGen project in last
 
06:25:57.270 --> 06:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
April this is a a brand new
 
06:26:00.390 --> 06:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh cloud-based system Microsoft
 
06:26:03.628 --> 06:26:03.638 align:start position:0%
cloud-based system and this is some of
 
06:26:06.590 --> 06:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
the things that we've done as as part of
 
06:26:09.030 --> 06:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
the roll out of that project it's been
 
06:26:11.830 --> 06:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
very successful as with any uh project
 
06:26:15.468 --> 06:26:15.478 align:start position:0%
of that size uh we're replacing a 40y
 
06:26:19.350 --> 06:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
old uh Hardware system and Software
 
06:26:21.708 --> 06:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
System so this includes everything in
 
06:26:23.190 --> 06:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
the back of the house and front of the
 
06:26:25.270 --> 06:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
house for the Liquor Commission it's a
 
06:26:29.708 --> 06:26:29.718 align:start position:0%
huge uh huge undertaking and it's
 
06:26:33.030 --> 06:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
gone very well it has had a few things
 
06:26:34.628 --> 06:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
and we've dealt with them as it's come
 
06:26:36.788 --> 06:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
up but we're we're getting through it
 
06:26:39.430 --> 06:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we feel that it's very successful as
 
06:26:42.468 --> 06:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
do our licenses and the biggest piece of
 
06:26:45.310 --> 06:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
it it was rolled out last April we ran
 
06:26:47.948 --> 06:26:47.958 align:start position:0%
through a very busy summer season and
 
06:26:49.868 --> 06:26:49.878 align:start position:0%
none of our customers knew that we were
 
06:26:53.190 --> 06:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
on a new system so that's where we where
 
06:26:56.310 --> 06:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
we live that's the most important thing
 
06:26:58.628 --> 06:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
so on page
 
06:27:00.868 --> 06:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
14 you'll see that we have nine
 
06:27:03.350 --> 06:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
state-owned stores and the appro and the
 
06:27:06.590 --> 06:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
square footage goes along with them 59
 
06:27:08.670 --> 06:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
lease stores and the square footage that
 
06:27:11.628 --> 06:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
goes along with that and we have now 37
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
Outlets that do curbside pickup and the
 
06:27:17.510 --> 06:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
next piece we will move on to in the
 
06:27:20.310 --> 06:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
near future is home
 
06:27:24.670 --> 06:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
delivery on page 15 you have uh the
 
06:27:27.750 --> 06:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
outlets the outlet changes renov
 
06:27:31.750 --> 06:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
renovated 44 outlets in 35 communities
 
06:27:33.788 --> 06:27:33.798 align:start position:0%
this is really all about building the
 
06:27:36.150 --> 06:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
brand of the Liquor Commission which we
 
06:27:40.750 --> 06:27:40.760 align:start position:0%

2012 uh very successful uh nationally
 
06:27:47.390 --> 06:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
recognized and we're hoping that our
 
06:27:49.868 --> 06:27:49.878 align:start position:0%
consumers is enjoying what they see as
 
06:27:53.070 --> 06:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
far as a selection and layout of our
 
06:27:57.030 --> 06:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
stores marketing goals are on page 15
 
06:27:58.430 --> 06:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry page
 
06:28:02.390 --> 06:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
16 uh just we're trying to have
 
06:28:04.230 --> 06:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
worldclass events we do a lot of
 
06:28:07.030 --> 06:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
tastings we do a lot of Education we do
 
06:28:09.628 --> 06:28:09.638 align:start position:0%

and people uh wine makers and Spirits
 
06:28:14.750 --> 06:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
makers from around the country uh we're
 
06:28:17.070 --> 06:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
trying to provide excellent service for
 
06:28:19.270 --> 06:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
our for our customers which is our
 
06:28:22.628 --> 06:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
primary goal and to be Innovative in all
 
06:28:25.468 --> 06:28:25.478 align:start position:0%
areas uh this is very important for us
 
06:28:28.948 --> 06:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
because we have that Total Wine to our
 
06:28:31.468 --> 06:28:31.478 align:start position:0%
South and as I've said they're very
 
06:28:34.310 --> 06:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
Innovative they're a very large company
 
06:28:36.628 --> 06:28:36.638 align:start position:0%

and tobacco as well a big big piece of
 
06:28:47.750 --> 06:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
their business is things outside of the
 
06:28:50.468 --> 06:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
alcohol world so we're trying to compete
 
06:28:52.830 --> 06:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
with them and still remain uh
 
06:28:55.190 --> 06:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
competitive in New England and so far we
 
06:28:57.910 --> 06:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
seem to be doing a pretty good job of it
 
06:28:59.548 --> 06:28:59.558 align:start position:0%

has re received in 26 over the few years
 
06:33:09.230 --> 06:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh the most important one to us is from
 
06:33:12.070 --> 06:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
market watch we've been one of the top
 
06:33:15.468 --> 06:33:15.478 align:start position:0%
10 retailers for the last five years
 
06:33:18.868 --> 06:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
from market watch which is basically uh
 
06:33:21.548 --> 06:33:21.558 align:start position:0%
the wine and spirits magazine of the
 
06:33:24.750 --> 06:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
country so that's been very impressive
 
06:33:27.868 --> 06:33:27.878 align:start position:0%
for us and for this state to be able to
 
06:33:31.230 --> 06:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
get those accolades uh those commanding
 
06:33:35.190 --> 06:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
ACC accolades quite frankly so with that
 
06:33:38.030 --> 06:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
being said I'll have Tina walk you
 
06:33:41.590 --> 06:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
through the uh revenues and take it from
 
06:33:43.310 --> 06:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
06:33:48.388 --> 06:33:48.398 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon so on page 27 you
 
06:33:50.628 --> 06:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
have the revenue transfers and the
 
06:33:52.990 --> 06:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
transfer language which is the transfers
 
06:33:53.000 --> 06:33:53.910 align:start position:0%
transfer language which is the transfers
to

06:33:53.910 --> 06:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:33:56.430 --> 06:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
HHS uh being that we're self-funded our
 
06:33:58.030 --> 06:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
projected revenue is dependent on the
 
06:34:00.788 --> 06:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
budget that we're requesting starts off
 
06:34:02.910 --> 06:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
with Row one our gross profit is down
 
06:34:04.350 --> 06:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
slightly in 20
 
06:34:07.030 --> 06:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
and projected to increase slightly in 26
 
06:34:10.670 --> 06:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
and 27 with us adjusting um purchasing
 
06:34:10.680 --> 06:34:11.430 align:start position:0%
and 27 with us adjusting um purchasing
and

06:34:11.430 --> 06:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:34:14.548 --> 06:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
discounting uh expense expense estimates
 
06:34:18.150 --> 06:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
are increasing in 26 and 27 based on our
 
06:34:20.788 --> 06:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
current projected spend with the net
 
06:34:20.798 --> 06:34:21.910 align:start position:0%
current projected spend with the net
revenue

06:34:21.910 --> 06:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
06:34:25.590 --> 06:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
flat uh the transfers are the two rsas
 
06:34:27.750 --> 06:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
that are on the bottom of the page uh
 
06:34:30.708 --> 06:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
the first one is the transfers regarding
 
06:34:34.310 --> 06:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 17616 which is 5% of the prior
 
06:34:36.868 --> 06:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
year gross profit to the alcohol abuse
 
06:34:38.788 --> 06:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
and prevention fund and you'll see the
 
06:34:42.230 --> 06:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
amounts range from 7.10 million and 24
 
06:34:45.030 --> 06:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
up to 10.9 million in
 
06:34:48.990 --> 06:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
27 then there's the transfer per RSA 126
 
06:34:51.350 --> 06:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
AA colon 3 which is for granted
 
06:34:54.750 --> 06:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
Advantage uh it was 7.2 million in 24
 
06:34:59.430 --> 06:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
and is estimated by HHS for uh 25 at
 
06:35:03.110 --> 06:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
13.3 million this is 6 million higher
 
06:35:04.708 --> 06:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
than y
 
06:35:07.548 --> 06:35:07.558 align:start position:0%
25 um this also includes an additional
 
06:35:11.110 --> 06:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
1.1 million uh that we recently received
 
06:35:14.150 --> 06:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
a letter um they have to quarterly um
 
06:35:16.190 --> 06:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
ask for increases if there is a
 
06:35:18.270 --> 06:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
shortfall in the fund and they say that
 
06:35:20.270 --> 06:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a million to 2 million
 
06:35:22.190 --> 06:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
this year that they're going to be short
 
06:35:23.868 --> 06:35:23.878 align:start position:0%
so there's an additional money in there
 
06:35:27.868 --> 06:35:27.878 align:start position:0%
for that so in 26 and 27 the amount is
 
06:35:31.868 --> 06:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
12.6 and 13 million um for the total
 
06:35:35.708 --> 06:35:35.718 align:start position:0%
transfers you'll see on row 7 to HHS uh
 
06:35:41.510 --> 06:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
FY 24 was 17.9 million um to 23.4
 
06:35:45.430 --> 06:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
million and then um in 26 and 27 is the
 
06:35:49.150 --> 06:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
23.4 and the 23.9 million um then you
 
06:35:51.670 --> 06:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
have the remaining liquor Revenue
 
06:35:55.510 --> 06:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
transferred to the general fund in fy2
 
06:35:58.070 --> 06:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's $8 million less because of that
 
06:36:00.788 --> 06:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
additional 6 million that's going to
 
06:36:04.948 --> 06:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
HHS um and then you have beer tax uh the
 
06:36:07.708 --> 06:36:07.718 align:start position:0%
revenue transfer which is flat which
 
06:36:09.590 --> 06:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
comes to the total transfer to the
 
06:36:14.388 --> 06:36:14.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:21.708 --> 06:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
10 so then on page 28 is our um 26 27
 
06:36:23.868 --> 06:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
budget request we've also included the
 
06:36:28.150 --> 06:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
24 actual and 25 adjusted authorized uh
 
06:36:30.708 --> 06:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
after we met with governor aot and her
 
06:36:32.948 --> 06:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
team we went back and re-evaluated our
 
06:36:36.310 --> 06:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
budget for 26 and 27 and are proposing a
 
06:36:38.990 --> 06:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
reduction each year by 3.3 million from
 
06:36:41.310 --> 06:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
our original request where it's about
 
06:36:44.468 --> 06:36:44.478 align:start position:0%
2.8% this aligns expense estimates with
 
06:36:47.150 --> 06:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
our Revenue uh transfer estimates
 
06:36:49.670 --> 06:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
currently and it's also important to
 
06:36:51.708 --> 06:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
note that over the last 5 years we've
 
06:36:54.910 --> 06:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
lapsed uh approximately 1 million to 6
 
06:36:57.548 --> 06:36:57.558 align:start position:0%
million on average about 3.5 million we
 
06:36:59.990 --> 06:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
lapse from our
 
06:37:04.510 --> 06:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
budget so on page 29 you'll see um our
 
06:37:07.350 --> 06:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
major expense categories that correspond
 
06:37:09.510 --> 06:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
to the table on page 28 and then the
 
06:37:11.910 --> 06:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
referencing line numbers um for easy
 
06:37:14.190 --> 06:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
reference so the first one is salaries
 
06:37:17.388 --> 06:37:17.398 align:start position:0%
and benefits they're 45% of our total
 
06:37:20.468 --> 06:37:20.478 align:start position:0%
budget and they're increasing in 26 by
 
06:37:22.190 --> 06:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
800,000 or
 
06:37:27.548 --> 06:37:27.558 align:start position:0%
1.6% and 1.5 million or 2.9% in 27 but
 
06:37:31.150 --> 06:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
we are cutting 900,000 each year by uh
 
06:37:34.110 --> 06:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
unfund seven positions that we currently
 
06:37:36.990 --> 06:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
have on hold and we've reduced overtime
 
06:37:39.510 --> 06:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
part-time and Associated
 
06:37:42.350 --> 06:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
benefits number two is uh current
 
06:37:46.468 --> 06:37:46.478 align:start position:0%
expense in 26 it's decreasing 7.4% or
 
06:37:50.270 --> 06:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
370,000 in 27 it's level funded and
 
06:37:53.190 --> 06:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
we're cutting a 100,000 in each
 
06:37:56.230 --> 06:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
year then there's rents and leases the
 
06:37:58.388 --> 06:37:58.398 align:start position:0%
funding um is for our current rent
 
06:38:01.388 --> 06:38:01.398 align:start position:0%
obligations and potential relocations
 
06:38:03.468 --> 06:38:03.478 align:start position:0%
and we're going to cut this line by
 
06:38:06.830 --> 06:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
00,000 each year utilities is number
 
06:38:09.948 --> 06:38:09.958 align:start position:0%
four FY 26 is down
 
06:38:13.590 --> 06:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
500,000 uh or 16.6% and then we're level
 
06:38:17.350 --> 06:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
funding in 27 and cutting about 26,000
 
06:38:18.910 --> 06:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
each year in that
 
06:38:21.350 --> 06:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
line number five contracts for
 
06:38:24.070 --> 06:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
operational Services uh this includes
 
06:38:25.510 --> 06:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
all of our contracts for store
 
06:38:27.270 --> 06:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance uh such as you know
 
06:38:30.788 --> 06:38:30.798 align:start position:0%
electrical HVAC security systems uh
 
06:38:33.948 --> 06:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
doors uh and our nextg our new nextg
 
06:38:36.310 --> 06:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
system um this funding is based on our
 
06:38:37.948 --> 06:38:37.958 align:start position:0%
current contracts and our projected
 
06:38:40.468 --> 06:38:40.478 align:start position:0%
needs and we're cutting that line by
 
06:38:42.868 --> 06:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
about 350,000 each
 
06:38:45.868 --> 06:38:45.878 align:start position:0%
year number six technology hardware and
 
06:38:49.548 --> 06:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
software FY 26 is decreasing 1.6 million
 
06:38:52.670 --> 06:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
or 61% and this is from changes in our
 
06:38:55.990 --> 06:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
in needs we did move some funding from
 
06:38:58.270 --> 06:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
the supporting of our system from this
 
06:39:01.708 --> 06:39:01.718 align:start position:0%
line to our contracts line and the
 
06:39:03.628 --> 06:39:03.638 align:start position:0%
remaining funding is for for
 
06:39:05.190 --> 06:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
subscriptions and the cloud-based
 
06:39:07.788 --> 06:39:07.798 align:start position:0%
Services based on our current
 
06:39:11.070 --> 06:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
agreements number seven doit funding for
 
06:39:12.990 --> 06:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
annual software requirements uh
 
06:39:15.150 --> 06:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
replacing equipment such as laptops and
 
06:39:18.030 --> 06:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
handheld devices uh we're cutting this
 
06:39:20.548 --> 06:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
line 1.4 million each year and this was
 
06:39:23.190 --> 06:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
done in collaboration with
 
06:39:26.510 --> 06:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
doit we have equipment this includes um
 
06:39:30.670 --> 06:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
shelving checkout counters cameras cars
 
06:39:32.628 --> 06:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
uh and we're cutting this line by
 
06:39:34.788 --> 06:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
400,000 each
 
06:39:38.750 --> 06:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
year number nine is travel FY 26 the
 
06:39:40.830 --> 06:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
increas is to support the current trend
 
06:39:43.388 --> 06:39:43.398 align:start position:0%
for maintaining State vehicles and uh
 
06:39:45.750 --> 06:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
supports shifting of staff from One
 
06:39:48.150 --> 06:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
retail location to another to pay travel
 
06:39:49.990 --> 06:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
and for any store
 
06:39:54.230 --> 06:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
moves number 10 other expenses FY 26 is
 
06:39:56.910 --> 06:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
decreasing in debt Services based on the
 
06:39:59.548 --> 06:39:59.558 align:start position:0%
current Bond schedule and estimates for
 
06:40:02.270 --> 06:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
new bonds and workers comp is based
 
06:40:04.388 --> 06:40:04.398 align:start position:0%
decreasing based on on uh historical
 
06:40:06.430 --> 06:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
Trend and then there's an increase in
 
06:40:08.350 --> 06:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
indirect cost and this is based on the
 
06:40:11.830 --> 06:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
estimates provided by Das and then FY 27
 
06:40:14.430 --> 06:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
is level funded one thing you will note
 
06:40:17.070 --> 06:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
is my numbering on here is a little off
 
06:40:20.150 --> 06:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
um number grants is number 12 and
 
06:40:22.350 --> 06:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
they're increasing based on uh the
 
06:40:25.070 --> 06:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
available funding from FDA for tobacco
 
06:40:27.468 --> 06:40:27.478 align:start position:0%
compliance and then uh it should be
 
06:40:29.788 --> 06:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
number 13 which is the transfer to other
 
06:40:31.990 --> 06:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
funds so for transparency purposes and
 
06:40:35.110 --> 06:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
to make it easier uh we put in the
 
06:40:42.030 --> 06:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:46.430 --> 06:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
item so on page 30 and 31 um these are
 
06:40:48.110 --> 06:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
the annual breakdown by class and
 
06:40:49.708 --> 06:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
accounting unit the breakdown is
 
06:40:51.910 --> 06:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
consistent for both years in both class
 
06:40:54.788 --> 06:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
and accounting unit so in FY 26 our
 
06:40:57.030 --> 06:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
current proposed budget is 3.3 million
 
06:40:59.548 --> 06:40:59.558 align:start position:0%
or 2.8% less than
 
06:41:03.868 --> 06:41:03.878 align:start position:0%
fy2 and the original um 26 requests
 
06:41:06.350 --> 06:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
our funding source is primarily liquor
 
06:41:08.310 --> 06:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
funds with less than a million from
 
06:41:09.948 --> 06:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
federal and other funds and those are
 
06:41:12.990 --> 06:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
our grants so by class the largest
 
06:41:15.070 --> 06:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
categories are salaries and benefits at
 
06:41:18.910 --> 06:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
45% and then the transfer to HHS at 20%
 
06:41:21.388 --> 06:41:21.398 align:start position:0%
and then rent with 10% and then you can
 
06:41:23.788 --> 06:41:23.798 align:start position:0%
see by accounting unit store operations
 
06:41:29.110 --> 06:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:32.230 --> 06:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
budget so on the next Pages uh you'll
 
06:41:35.430 --> 06:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
see we provided a summary by division as
 
06:41:38.430 --> 06:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
listed in the budget book um with page
 
06:41:40.628 --> 06:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
references for the book uh there's a pie
 
06:41:42.310 --> 06:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
chart that shows the breakdown by the
 
06:41:44.910 --> 06:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
class category and an explanation for
 
06:41:47.990 --> 06:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
changes um and these numbers are based
 
06:41:51.510 --> 06:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
on the proposed Cuts so starting with
 
06:41:53.468 --> 06:41:53.478 align:start position:0%
the office of the commission overseeing
 
06:41:55.468 --> 06:41:55.478 align:start position:0%
all operations of the commission with
 
06:41:57.670 --> 06:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
the primary goal to increase sales and
 
06:42:00.230 --> 06:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
maximize profits while operating in a
 
06:42:02.468 --> 06:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
cost effective and efficient manner
 
06:42:05.388 --> 06:42:05.398 align:start position:0%
you'll see that FY 26 it's decreasing
 
06:42:09.708 --> 06:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
slightly by 50,000 or 2.8% and then 27
 
06:42:13.230 --> 06:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
is level funded uh the main reason for
 
06:42:15.910 --> 06:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
the decrease in 26 is we moved one
 
06:42:18.590 --> 06:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
position from here to the division of
 
06:42:21.030 --> 06:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
administration and then there were some
 
06:42:23.350 --> 06:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
increases in indirect cost for the
 
06:42:25.430 --> 06:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
change in how it's allocated by
 
06:42:28.110 --> 06:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
divisions and a decrease in contracts
 
06:42:30.310 --> 06:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
and current
 
06:42:33.990 --> 06:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
expense so on page 33 is the division of
 
06:42:36.468 --> 06:42:36.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh this includes enforcement
 
06:42:39.310 --> 06:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
licensing and education and grants uh
 
06:42:40.788 --> 06:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
the division is responsible for
 
06:42:43.350 --> 06:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
enforcing alcoholic beverage laws
 
06:42:46.350 --> 06:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
enforcing youth access to tobacco and
 
06:42:48.350 --> 06:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
providing licensing education and
 
06:42:53.388 --> 06:42:53.398 align:start position:0%
support for over the 6100 lenses or
 
06:42:59.350 --> 06:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
6200 um so the FY 26 is increasing 12%
 
06:43:05.030 --> 06:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
or 579,000 and fy2 7 is increasing 2.7%
 
06:43:05.040 --> 06:43:06.788 align:start position:0%
or 579,000 and fy2 7 is increasing 2.7%
or

06:43:06.788 --> 06:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:43:09.670 --> 06:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
143,000 the reason for the increase in
 
06:43:12.990 --> 06:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
26 is we moved one full-time position
 
06:43:15.590 --> 06:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
and five part-time positions to create a
 
06:43:19.230 --> 06:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
new loss prevention program to help with
 
06:43:22.430 --> 06:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
um thefts in the stores and Public
 
06:43:24.910 --> 06:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
Safety with no trespass orders and
 
06:43:26.590 --> 06:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
they've had great success with the
 
06:43:29.548 --> 06:43:29.558 align:start position:0%
program um the liquor store they visited
 
06:43:33.628 --> 06:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
79% of the liquor stores the arrest up
 
06:43:38.430 --> 06:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:42.948 --> 06:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
91% uh so operations they are increasing
 
06:43:45.628 --> 06:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
37,000 and this is for fuel and repair
 
06:43:50.430 --> 06:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
for their state cars and 27 is um
 
06:43:54.110 --> 06:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
increasing slightly um for salaries and
 
06:43:56.910 --> 06:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
steps and benefit
 
06:44:01.350 --> 06:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
increases so on page 34 is the division
 
06:44:03.990 --> 06:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
of administration this is includes uh
 
06:44:07.350 --> 06:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
Finance HR audit inventory control and
 
06:44:10.628 --> 06:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
legal and as part of a restructuring we
 
06:44:13.030 --> 06:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
moved our real estate and maintenance
 
06:44:16.708 --> 06:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
department along with um we created a
 
06:44:19.948 --> 06:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
department for the new system support so
 
06:44:22.670 --> 06:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
there was a total of 12 positions moved
 
06:44:25.708 --> 06:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
from other divisions into this
 
06:44:30.510 --> 06:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
division so FY 26 there's a decrease um
 
06:44:33.030 --> 06:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
slate decrease and FY 27 is an increase
 
06:44:36.468 --> 06:44:36.478 align:start position:0%
increase of 2.5 or 270,000 so what
 
06:44:38.830 --> 06:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see here is salaries and benefits
 
06:44:41.990 --> 06:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
increased 1.9 million for those 12
 
06:44:43.750 --> 06:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
positions for all of those different
 
06:44:46.750 --> 06:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
locations but the offset is the decrease
 
06:44:50.310 --> 06:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
in doit by the 1.8 million so it netted
 
06:44:53.070 --> 06:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
out and then there's slight increase in
 
06:44:56.510 --> 06:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
26 I mean slight decrease in 26 um for
 
06:44:59.350 --> 06:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
the reallocation of indirect costs and
 
06:45:01.230 --> 06:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
then there's a slight increase because
 
06:45:03.150 --> 06:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
we had to move the rent expense for for
 
06:45:05.350 --> 06:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
the maintenance department into this and
 
06:45:11.110 --> 06:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:13.150 --> 06:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
funded then there's the division of
 
06:45:14.868 --> 06:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
marketing and Merchandising this
 
06:45:17.270 --> 06:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
includes marketing merchandising uh
 
06:45:20.468 --> 06:45:20.478 align:start position:0%
advertising retail store outlets and the
 
06:45:22.948 --> 06:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
headquarters Warehouse the division
 
06:45:25.350 --> 06:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
oversees the buying marketing selling
 
06:45:28.070 --> 06:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
and distributing of product through all
 
06:45:30.628 --> 06:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
channels to promote sales and maximize
 
06:45:30.638 --> 06:45:33.948 align:start position:0%
channels to promote sales and maximize
profits

06:45:33.948 --> 06:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:39.350 --> 06:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
in FY 26 the decrease is 2.5% or 2.5
 
06:45:43.110 --> 06:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
million this decrease is primarily from
 
06:45:46.350 --> 06:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
moving positions and the positions move
 
06:45:48.750 --> 06:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
to the other Division and then unfund
 
06:45:51.948 --> 06:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
those uh other seven positions and then
 
06:45:55.830 --> 06:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
FY 27 the increas is primarily from
 
06:45:58.070 --> 06:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
salary step and benefit and then
 
06:46:01.070 --> 06:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
increases in retire health benefits and
 
06:46:02.628 --> 06:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
then you'll see under the operations
 
06:46:05.830 --> 06:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
there's 's um a decrease in the debt and
 
06:46:05.840 --> 06:46:06.590 align:start position:0%
there's 's um a decrease in the debt and
the

06:46:06.590 --> 06:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:46:09.190 --> 06:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
technology um in utilities and then an
 
06:46:13.310 --> 06:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
increase in contracts rents and indirect
 
06:46:16.990 --> 06:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
costs and then on page 36 workers comp
 
06:46:20.388 --> 06:46:20.398 align:start position:0%
and unemployment comp uh workers comp is
 
06:46:23.510 --> 06:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
decreasing 71% or
 
06:46:26.030 --> 06:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
87,000 and this number was provided by
 
06:46:27.910 --> 06:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
risk management and is based on the
 
06:46:30.190 --> 06:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
historical Trend so it's good that
 
06:46:32.990 --> 06:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
workers comp costs have been going down
 
06:46:35.590 --> 06:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
and then un unemployment comp is level
 
06:46:38.270 --> 06:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
funded and then the final page um to
 
06:46:40.190 --> 06:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
answer the questions that were sent by
 
06:46:44.030 --> 06:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
the chairman um we have no general fund
 
06:46:46.510 --> 06:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
Appropriations uh this page shows the
 
06:46:48.230 --> 06:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
list of new positions that we've had in
 
06:46:49.868 --> 06:46:49.878 align:start position:0%
the last 5 years they were all
 
06:46:53.110 --> 06:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
established in 24 and they are 100%
 
06:46:55.230 --> 06:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
liquor funded and on the bottom you'll
 
06:46:57.190 --> 06:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
see the positions that we are currently
 
06:47:00.388 --> 06:47:00.398 align:start position:0%
holding and are proposing to unfund and
 
06:47:02.948 --> 06:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
then we did not receive any oper funds
 
06:47:05.388 --> 06:47:05.398 align:start position:0%
so we haven't had to adjust any funding
 
06:47:05.398 --> 06:47:06.510 align:start position:0%
so we haven't had to adjust any funding
for

06:47:06.510 --> 06:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:47:09.030 --> 06:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
that and we'll be happy to answer any
 
06:47:12.030 --> 06:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
questions on this last page 37 are these
 
06:47:14.110 --> 06:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
numbers include benefits or these yes
 
06:47:15.628 --> 06:47:15.638 align:start position:0%
they include benefits salary and
 
06:47:15.638 --> 06:47:17.548 align:start position:0%
they include benefits salary and
benefits

06:47:17.548 --> 06:47:17.558 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
06:47:19.948 --> 06:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
great um and then the other question I
 
06:47:24.350 --> 06:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
had was um page 27
 
06:47:28.830 --> 06:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh transfer to
 
06:47:32.310 --> 06:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
gcp um granted Advantage Healthcare
 
06:47:36.110 --> 06:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
program so there's a big jump from 24 to
 
06:47:40.270 --> 06:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:44.590 --> 06:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
is that is to offset funding that
 
06:47:49.388 --> 06:47:49.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:52.948 --> 06:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't there something to
 
06:47:55.468 --> 06:47:55.478 align:start position:0%
ask HHS yes something to ask HHS because
 
06:47:58.628 --> 06:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
the numbers are provided by them great
 
06:48:00.868 --> 06:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
all right other members have questions
 
06:48:02.468 --> 06:48:02.478 align:start position:0%
representative rang then representative
 
06:48:05.270 --> 06:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
Lee thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
06:48:07.230 --> 06:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
you for your presentation I have a
 
06:48:09.230 --> 06:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
couple questions
 
06:48:12.510 --> 06:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
um if someone is buying wine from out of
 
06:48:14.830 --> 06:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
state let's say a wine club and it's
 
06:48:16.590 --> 06:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
being delivered into New Hampshire how
 
06:48:19.510 --> 06:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
does that tax work the manufacturer or
 
06:48:21.350 --> 06:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
the the dist the out of state
 
06:48:23.388 --> 06:48:23.398 align:start position:0%
distributor pays New Hampshire the tax
 
06:48:26.948 --> 06:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
on that part of the direct shipping it's
 
06:48:28.628 --> 06:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
part of Direct ship the consumer would
 
06:48:32.310 --> 06:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
pay the tax on that oh okay and um I
 
06:48:34.910 --> 06:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
know there 's been an increase in THC
 
06:48:37.628 --> 06:48:37.638 align:start position:0%
beverage sales um same thing model
 
06:48:39.110 --> 06:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
somebody buys it from out of state it
 
06:48:40.388 --> 06:48:40.398 align:start position:0%
gets delivered in New Hampshire are
 
06:48:42.990 --> 06:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
those also taxed those are those are
 
06:48:44.788 --> 06:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
done through the beer wholesalers it's
 
06:48:47.708 --> 06:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
not something that we carry so any THC
 
06:48:50.350 --> 06:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
products are are are done to a beer
 
06:48:52.990 --> 06:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
wholesaler okay so are they are they
 
06:48:54.948 --> 06:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
subject to New Hampshire
 
06:48:58.150 --> 06:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
tax I can check for you okay I don't
 
06:49:00.948 --> 06:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
know I would imagine that it would be
 
06:49:02.468 --> 06:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
part of what they would have to report
 
06:49:05.750 --> 06:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
as their sales sales beer tax and their
 
06:49:08.590 --> 06:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
tax so the tax any of the products that
 
06:49:12.310 --> 06:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
they sell would go through uh would go
 
06:49:14.948 --> 06:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
through their their total sales which is
 
06:49:18.270 --> 06:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
tax by gallon and that's the tax that we
 
06:49:21.628 --> 06:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
collect 30 30 cents okay so even though
 
06:49:23.910 --> 06:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis isn't legalized in New
 
06:49:27.388 --> 06:49:27.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um people can purchase them
 
06:49:30.750 --> 06:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
from and have them delivered into New
 
06:49:33.750 --> 06:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um without
 
06:49:36.150 --> 06:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
no not none of the Cannabis products are
 
06:49:38.030 --> 06:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
legal in New Hampshire so they're not
 
06:49:40.670 --> 06:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
you're seeing some hemp products perhaps
 
06:49:42.388 --> 06:49:42.398 align:start position:0%
okay these are just like they're called
 
06:49:45.590 --> 06:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
THC and they sell them in um the
 
06:49:47.510 --> 06:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
different strengths so I don't know if
 
06:49:50.230 --> 06:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
the THC is derived from Cannabis or not
 
06:49:52.190 --> 06:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
maybe it is derived from something
 
06:49:54.468 --> 06:49:54.478 align:start position:0%
another plant my my guess is that it
 
06:49:58.190 --> 06:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
would be a hemp product canab okay and
 
06:50:01.110 --> 06:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
then um another question there's a huge
 
06:50:06.708 --> 06:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
Ray area here oh okay huge you know
 
06:50:08.150 --> 06:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
because you know where you you're
 
06:50:10.310 --> 06:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
talking about the competition from
 
06:50:12.990 --> 06:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
Cannabis that might I was just looking
 
06:50:14.388 --> 06:50:14.398 align:start position:0%
trying to find
 
06:50:17.270 --> 06:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
Opportunities um when we talk about the
 
06:50:19.190 --> 06:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
competition of cannabis it's not it's
 
06:50:21.708 --> 06:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
not necessarily in the beverage Market
 
06:50:24.070 --> 06:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
that we're speaking of okay we're we're
 
06:50:25.750 --> 06:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
recognizing and the country is
 
06:50:29.230 --> 06:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
recognizing when people are uh when
 
06:50:32.350 --> 06:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
people are spending dollars on cannabis
 
06:50:34.468 --> 06:50:34.478 align:start position:0%
uh in the three states around us let's
 
06:50:36.868 --> 06:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
say between
 
06:50:40.190 --> 06:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh Maine and Vermont we're
 
06:50:42.708 --> 06:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
talking about $3 billion do in cannabis
 
06:50:46.230 --> 06:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
sales a year so U everyone only has so
 
06:50:50.788 --> 06:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
much Expendable income and it's 44% of
 
06:50:53.628 --> 06:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
the people today are using cannabis over
 
06:50:57.910 --> 06:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
alcohol it was 33% last year so that
 
06:51:00.548 --> 06:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
we're we're seeing Nationwide that
 
06:51:02.628 --> 06:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
decline in alcohol for a number of re
 
06:51:04.670 --> 06:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
reasons the health
 
06:51:07.548 --> 06:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
benefits the presumed health benefits
 
06:51:10.548 --> 06:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
you've got the uh Surgeon General saying
 
06:51:12.468 --> 06:51:12.478 align:start position:0%
that any amount of alcohol is no good
 
06:51:14.548 --> 06:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
for you and could potentially cause
 
06:51:17.070 --> 06:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
cancer you have the Baby Boomers aging
 
06:51:19.468 --> 06:51:19.478 align:start position:0%
out of the market which is a huge piece
 
06:51:21.750 --> 06:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
of people that have bought alcohol for
 
06:51:24.948 --> 06:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
years they grew up with that group of
 
06:51:27.830 --> 06:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
people they covered it Millennials
 
06:51:30.468 --> 06:51:30.478 align:start position:0%
buying patterns are different so they
 
06:51:33.548 --> 06:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
don't buy in cupboard they buy for today
 
06:51:35.310 --> 06:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
so instead of coming in and taking the
 
06:51:38.628 --> 06:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
deal on the 12 bottles of wine at 15%
 
06:51:41.350 --> 06:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
off they'll come in and buy one bottle
 
06:51:43.590 --> 06:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
and it's just a it's a complete
 
06:51:47.230 --> 06:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
different mindset so we're adjusting for
 
06:51:50.230 --> 06:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
that but losing that huge segment of the
 
06:51:53.468 --> 06:51:53.478 align:start position:0%
market on top of the Cannabis on top of
 
06:51:55.670 --> 06:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
the health benefits is kind of The
 
06:51:58.468 --> 06:51:58.478 align:start position:0%
Perfect Storm for alcohol Nationwide
 
06:52:03.110 --> 06:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
thus the 5.9% decline in 3 years
 
06:52:06.548 --> 06:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
and the first decline in 30 years in
 
06:52:09.030 --> 06:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
2023 at
 
06:52:12.948 --> 06:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
2.9% so this is this is not a New
 
06:52:16.190 --> 06:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire phenomenon this is this is
 
06:52:18.628 --> 06:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
around the country we're seeing this we
 
06:52:22.150 --> 06:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
just happen to be surrounded by by one
 
06:52:24.310 --> 06:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the issues and are dealing with the
 
06:52:27.948 --> 06:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
other issues the national issues uh of
 
06:52:29.868 --> 06:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
the Surgeon General making comments
 
06:52:32.708 --> 06:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
about alcohol and People's Health trends
 
06:52:34.708 --> 06:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
and the Baby Boomers aging out of the
 
06:52:37.830 --> 06:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
market so with those exponential dollars
 
06:52:40.708 --> 06:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
not being spent in alcohol we're seeing
 
06:52:45.150 --> 06:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
this Nationwide represent leishman oh
 
06:52:46.910 --> 06:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
you can come back to me I have one more
 
06:52:49.070 --> 06:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
I don't mind she wants to ask all right
 
06:52:51.788 --> 06:52:51.798 align:start position:0%
well thank you um I think you also
 
06:52:54.708 --> 06:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned this but also the growth in
 
06:52:58.150 --> 06:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
non-alcoholic spirits and I was I saw a
 
06:53:00.150 --> 06:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
segment on television I think it was
 
06:53:02.110 --> 06:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
last week about stores that are selling
 
06:53:02.120 --> 06:53:03.030 align:start position:0%
last week about stores that are selling
this

06:53:03.030 --> 06:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:53:06.190 --> 06:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
is that an opportunity for the Liquor
 
06:53:09.788 --> 06:53:09.798 align:start position:0%
Commission to add to its offering
 
06:53:12.788 --> 06:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
non-alcoholic wine or Spirits things
 
06:53:15.750 --> 06:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
like that we we do we've we've run we
 
06:53:18.628 --> 06:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
have a number of non-alcoholic products
 
06:53:21.590 --> 06:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
in our stores we have non-alcoholic
 
06:53:24.070 --> 06:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
Spirits we have non-alcoholic wine and
 
06:53:26.830 --> 06:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
low alcohol wine what we're tending to
 
06:53:29.708 --> 06:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
see in the market is not one segment of
 
06:53:32.510 --> 06:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
things the mocktail is the biggest piece
 
06:53:35.150 --> 06:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
and we run a mocktail month every month
 
06:53:37.310 --> 06:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
where we partner with our business
 
06:53:40.110 --> 06:53:40.120 align:start position:0%
partners our lies around the state but
 
06:53:42.310 --> 06:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
even I watched a program the other night
 
06:53:45.430 --> 06:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
from New York a food program and it's a
 
06:53:48.230 --> 06:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
national nationally syndicated program
 
06:53:51.388 --> 06:53:51.398 align:start position:0%
and everything they did every cocktail
 
06:53:53.948 --> 06:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
they made was a mocktail so we're
 
06:53:56.590 --> 06:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
carrying all those things in our stores
 
06:53:59.030 --> 06:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
for people to make those mocktails we
 
06:54:01.270 --> 06:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
have recipe guides for them they're on
 
06:54:04.830 --> 06:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
our website there so we recognize that
 
06:54:07.708 --> 06:54:07.718 align:start position:0%
it's a part of the market that's growing
 
06:54:09.910 --> 06:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
it just happens to be a very small part
 
06:54:12.868 --> 06:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
of the market but as it grows it will it
 
06:54:15.270 --> 06:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
could be more substantial okay thank you
 
06:54:17.830 --> 06:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you let me ask a
 
06:54:20.190 --> 06:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
question directly related to that is our
 
06:54:24.070 --> 06:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
profit margin on a mocktail much less
 
06:54:27.388 --> 06:54:27.398 align:start position:0%
than um on alcohol because we don't have
 
06:54:30.030 --> 06:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
any special advantage over a grocery
 
06:54:32.468 --> 06:54:32.478 align:start position:0%
store or some other thing well most of
 
06:54:34.230 --> 06:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
the items that are used to make a
 
06:54:36.708 --> 06:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
mocktail are non-alcoholic so this the
 
06:54:39.190 --> 06:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
few items that we have in our stores
 
06:54:42.270 --> 06:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
we're making we're making our markup on
 
06:54:44.868 --> 06:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
but the real winner of this is the
 
06:54:47.708 --> 06:54:47.718 align:start position:0%
lenses because you're seeing they're
 
06:54:49.910 --> 06:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
they're their bartenders are creative
 
06:54:51.110 --> 06:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
the people that work for them are
 
06:54:53.310 --> 06:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
creative as they should be I was in the
 
06:54:55.830 --> 06:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
business for 30 years I would want my my
 
06:54:57.830 --> 06:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
folks to be doing that and they're
 
06:55:00.750 --> 06:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
selling a non-alcoholic cocktail or a
 
06:55:04.548 --> 06:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
mocktail for as much or more in some
 
06:55:07.270 --> 06:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
cases than they are for a gin and tonic
 
06:55:10.628 --> 06:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
let's say and their cost is widely
 
06:55:12.788 --> 06:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
reduced because there's no alcohol in
 
06:55:15.350 --> 06:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
the drink but my point was they don't
 
06:55:18.548 --> 06:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
have to buy the the contents from you no
 
06:55:20.510 --> 06:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
they could go to Market Basket or go
 
06:55:23.430 --> 06:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere absolutely there's no specific
 
06:55:26.430 --> 06:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
products that we carry to make mocktails
 
06:55:29.190 --> 06:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
that aren't available in Market baskets
 
06:55:32.110 --> 06:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
or at the corner store quite frankly
 
06:55:34.110 --> 06:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
right all right representative
 
06:55:36.388 --> 06:55:36.398 align:start position:0%
Lee thank you Mr
 
06:55:40.110 --> 06:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
chairman so looking at uh chairman
 
06:55:40.120 --> 06:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
chairman so looking at uh chairman
Maguire's

06:55:41.750 --> 06:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
Maguire's
 
06:55:45.628 --> 06:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
uh chart here if you will uh it shows
 
06:55:47.910 --> 06:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
the same I guess in my
 
06:55:51.670 --> 06:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
opinion uh Trend over the last few years
 
06:55:55.110 --> 06:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
of increase expenses if these numbers
 
06:55:57.670 --> 06:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
are correct which I sure they are it's
 
06:56:03.070 --> 06:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
like 55% increase between 19 and 25
 
06:56:05.788 --> 06:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
so I went back and looked and our
 
06:56:09.270 --> 06:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
expenses back in 2014 were $48 million
 
06:56:12.430 --> 06:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
and now we're running you know well over
 
06:56:17.750 --> 06:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
well 120,000 I $120 million for expenses
 
06:56:20.948 --> 06:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
what's the real driving force here is IT
 
06:56:20.958 --> 06:56:22.350 align:start position:0%
what's the real driving force here is IT
personnel

06:56:22.350 --> 06:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
06:56:25.310 --> 06:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh the concern I also have is
 
06:56:28.468 --> 06:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
the debt service line uh we are carrying
 
06:56:30.990 --> 06:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of debt and I see that you've got
 
06:56:34.990 --> 06:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
two stores planned for uh 95 north and
 
06:56:37.948 --> 06:56:37.958 align:start position:0%
south is are those going to be paid for
 
06:56:40.670 --> 06:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
with debts or how is that going to I I'm
 
06:56:42.270 --> 06:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I threw a couple of questions in
 
06:56:45.590 --> 06:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
here Mr chairman but so well the first
 
06:56:48.230 --> 06:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
thing is to back off the 20 million for
 
06:56:51.670 --> 06:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
the transfer to HHS there's that's new
 
06:56:55.670 --> 06:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
expense then um in 24 and 25 the pay
 
06:56:59.510 --> 06:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
raise increase equated to $4 million um
 
06:57:04.628 --> 06:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
each year um the debt service we have um
 
06:57:07.150 --> 06:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
an RSA or there's statue out there for
 
06:57:09.110 --> 06:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
when we sell the Hampton properties that
 
06:57:11.388 --> 06:57:11.398 align:start position:0%
the funding that we receive from selling
 
06:57:13.548 --> 06:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
that land will go towards paying down
 
06:57:16.510 --> 06:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
our debt so the goal is is that our debt
 
06:57:18.910 --> 06:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
would be substantially reduced and
 
06:57:20.708 --> 06:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
either the building of the stores will
 
06:57:23.350 --> 06:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
be part of that agreement or it we do
 
06:57:25.150 --> 06:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
have a capital appropriation for about
 
06:57:27.868 --> 06:57:27.878 align:start position:0%
$15 million to build
 
06:57:31.150 --> 06:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
stores further question Mr chairman so
 
06:57:33.430 --> 06:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
where is that 15 million going to come
 
06:57:35.830 --> 06:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
from to build those two stores we have a
 
06:57:38.070 --> 06:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
capital appropriation appropriation and
 
06:57:40.070 --> 06:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's all liquor funds entirely liquor
 
06:57:44.270 --> 06:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:47.948 --> 06:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
okay so I guess the um the other
 
06:57:49.670 --> 06:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
question I have if you could provide us
 
06:57:52.110 --> 06:57:52.120 align:start position:0%
with the total revenues for the last
 
06:57:54.430 --> 06:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
several years so we can compare that
 
06:57:56.628 --> 06:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
with expenses and what we're getting
 
06:57:59.230 --> 06:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
back I know it's in the $700 million
 
06:58:01.388 --> 06:58:01.398 align:start position:0%
range plus or minus I guess more plus
 
06:58:03.750 --> 06:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm just curious on the trend over
 
06:58:06.468 --> 06:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
the last you know five six seven years
 
06:58:09.868 --> 06:58:09.878 align:start position:0%
on revenues coming in with expenses plus
 
06:58:12.030 --> 06:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
what we're getting back and the chairman
 
06:58:15.990 --> 06:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
and I um I think share a concern of the
 
06:58:19.430 --> 06:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
transfer um without any budget for the
 
06:58:22.190 --> 06:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol fund and said are you
 
06:58:24.628 --> 06:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
aware do they prepare any sort of budget
 
06:58:26.070 --> 06:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that or are you just
 
06:58:28.910 --> 06:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
send them the money as required by the
 
06:58:31.388 --> 06:58:31.398 align:start position:0%
statute they send us a letter requesting
 
06:58:33.670 --> 06:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
the money in send it to them as required
 
06:58:36.388 --> 06:58:36.398 align:start position:0%
by the statute yeah so the numbers I I
 
06:58:39.590 --> 06:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
put in here were provided by HHS is the
 
06:58:41.628 --> 06:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
estimated funding that they need and
 
06:58:43.310 --> 06:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
you're not aware that there's a budget
 
06:58:46.190 --> 06:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
they present anywhere no so okay thank
 
06:58:49.948 --> 06:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
you yeah I think that's HHS but in in
 
06:58:53.070 --> 06:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
the past that has sometimes been um
 
06:58:56.788 --> 06:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
suspended um let me ask a big picture
 
06:59:00.310 --> 06:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
kind of question compared to Total Wine
 
06:59:03.510 --> 06:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
what's the source of of any
 
06:59:07.750 --> 06:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
um any lower costs for us by comparison
 
06:59:10.110 --> 06:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
to them I mean presumably they pay
 
06:59:13.070 --> 06:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
federal income tax we don't things like
 
06:59:16.110 --> 06:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
that are there other kinds of taxes that
 
06:59:18.910 --> 06:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
they owe that that we don't I mean is
 
06:59:24.830 --> 06:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
there some source of of our profits over
 
06:59:28.628 --> 06:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
them I'm not sure I call Total Wine
 
06:59:30.548 --> 06:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
Total Wine is your big competitor in
 
06:59:33.030 --> 06:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts right but that's a private
 
06:59:35.350 --> 06:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
company correct right so they have to
 
06:59:37.590 --> 06:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
pay federal income tax for example on
 
06:59:41.350 --> 06:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
their profits we don't right so that's
 
06:59:44.628 --> 06:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
one source of of higher profits for us
 
06:59:47.830 --> 06:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
by comparison but maybe their volumes
 
06:59:50.548 --> 06:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
are much higher than ours and therefore
 
06:59:52.388 --> 06:59:52.398 align:start position:0%
they get a better price from Jack
 
06:59:54.548 --> 06:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
Daniels than we do or something like you
 
06:59:57.270 --> 06:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
know so so I'm trying to say how do we
 
06:59:59.670 --> 06:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
compare with them in terms
 
07:00:03.590 --> 07:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
of what's the main source of our low
 
07:00:06.190 --> 07:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
prices well competitive buying is the
 
07:00:09.548 --> 07:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
main source of our low prices so we work
 
07:00:12.590 --> 07:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
with our suppliers and we work them hard
 
07:00:14.788 --> 07:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
because we've been in business for a
 
07:00:16.990 --> 07:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
long time we have great relationships
 
07:00:19.868 --> 07:00:19.878 align:start position:0%
Total Wine does about6 billion dollar
 
07:00:23.230 --> 07:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
this year in sales the biggest piece of
 
07:00:25.830 --> 07:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
what they do that we don't do is they're
 
07:00:30.548 --> 07:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
a private labeler so 70% of the product
 
07:00:32.628 --> 07:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
that's on their sh
 
07:00:36.230 --> 07:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
are products that they own and label so
 
07:00:37.830 --> 07:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
they may
 
07:00:40.590 --> 07:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
have they knock off Brands all the time
 
07:00:43.310 --> 07:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
and I could walk you through dozens of
 
07:00:46.830 --> 07:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
them that that they do but what they do
 
07:00:51.190 --> 07:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
is they Source directly from let's say
 
07:00:53.910 --> 07:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
chardonay from from California and
 
07:00:56.548 --> 07:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
they'll do six to 12 to 15 labels of
 
07:00:59.350 --> 07:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
chardonay from California in a bottle so
 
07:01:01.990 --> 07:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
they're bulk they're bulk buying they're
 
07:01:04.750 --> 07:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
diversifying in their labels whether it
 
07:01:09.110 --> 07:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
be in Bourbon uh vodka gin rum or wine
 
07:01:12.830 --> 07:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
so their profit level on those items is
 
07:01:17.230 --> 07:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
probably somewhere in the 45% range they
 
07:01:20.030 --> 07:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
are a huge loss leader so they'll market
 
07:01:22.868 --> 07:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
against our prices but when consumers
 
07:01:25.190 --> 07:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
get there they don't have the quantity
 
07:01:28.150 --> 07:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
of pro of of product that we're looking
 
07:01:30.310 --> 07:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
for that they're looking for that our
 
07:01:32.788 --> 07:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
consumers are looking for so that's the
 
07:01:35.628 --> 07:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
advantage that New Hampshire has we work
 
07:01:37.030 --> 07:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
on about a
 
07:01:43.388 --> 07:01:43.398 align:start position:0%
28% GP and about a 21 20 to 21% net
 
07:01:48.190 --> 07:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
profit which is extremely good for any
 
07:01:50.310 --> 07:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
business but even in the alcohol
 
07:01:52.590 --> 07:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
business but Total Wine makes their
 
07:01:55.910 --> 07:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
money on private labeling they'll lose
 
07:01:59.110 --> 07:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
money on
 
07:02:02.750 --> 07:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
Tios but they'll make it up on Tower
 
07:02:05.468 --> 07:02:05.478 align:start position:0%
which is their Tito's knockoff so sell
 
07:02:07.190 --> 07:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
it for three or four dollar a bottle
 
07:02:09.708 --> 07:02:09.718 align:start position:0%
less it's made in
 
07:02:15.150 --> 07:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
Texas I see there you go do does um is
 
07:02:18.150 --> 07:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
there some other kind of federal tax on
 
07:02:21.190 --> 07:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
liquor does the federal government tax
 
07:02:24.030 --> 07:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
liquor x dollar per gallon or something
 
07:02:27.350 --> 07:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
like that that they pay and we don't or
 
07:02:30.230 --> 07:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
no no any of that any of that tax from a
 
07:02:32.388 --> 07:02:32.398 align:start position:0%
federal standpoint is paid at the
 
07:02:35.270 --> 07:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and Distilling level I see
 
07:02:37.708 --> 07:02:37.718 align:start position:0%
so we both pay it then we well
 
07:02:39.990 --> 07:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
indirectly we pay it through our through
 
07:02:43.990 --> 07:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of what we buy yes gotcha okay
 
07:02:45.948 --> 07:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
07:02:48.110 --> 07:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
evil not quite as
 
07:02:52.350 --> 07:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
complicated um the wine that you buy in
 
07:02:55.788 --> 07:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
grocery stores do the stores here buy it
 
07:02:58.388 --> 07:02:58.398 align:start position:0%
from you or they just pay how does that
 
07:03:01.150 --> 07:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
work they buy it from us we sell we sell
 
07:03:03.230 --> 07:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
it to them
 
07:03:05.868 --> 07:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
so we're the wholesaler in that respect
 
07:03:08.350 --> 07:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
and we're the retailer in what we do we
 
07:03:11.510 --> 07:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
pass along as good a pricing as we
 
07:03:14.708 --> 07:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
possibly can to them and we give them
 
07:03:18.830 --> 07:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
between 15 and 40 to 50 specials a month
 
07:03:21.990 --> 07:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
where we will reduce our profit on them
 
07:03:23.868 --> 07:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
so they can make a little bit more money
 
07:03:26.310 --> 07:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
in their stores but everything that they
 
07:03:29.590 --> 07:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
buy is bought through us and it used to
 
07:03:32.670 --> 07:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
be I thought that they couldn't unell
 
07:03:36.910 --> 07:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
you is that still the case well in
 
07:03:39.110 --> 07:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
some I don't believe that there's any
 
07:03:41.468 --> 07:03:41.478 align:start position:0%
law or rule that says that they can't
 
07:03:43.670 --> 07:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
undersell us they typically don't
 
07:03:45.788 --> 07:03:45.798 align:start position:0%
because the convenience factor is really
 
07:03:47.788 --> 07:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
what they're they're they're buying now
 
07:03:50.788 --> 07:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
they markup in some items that we would
 
07:03:52.590 --> 07:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
that we deal back to them that we give
 
07:03:55.388 --> 07:03:55.398 align:start position:0%
them a good deal on so they'll buy in
 
07:03:58.510 --> 07:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
heavy on those products keep the retail
 
07:04:00.430 --> 07:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
at their normal retail and make the
 
07:04:02.030 --> 07:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
additional markup they're not
 
07:04:03.830 --> 07:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily passing it along to the
 
07:04:06.230 --> 07:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
consumer and you know as business people
 
07:04:07.990 --> 07:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
we know in respect they do what they
 
07:04:09.868 --> 07:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
have to do but they're they're clearly
 
07:04:12.510 --> 07:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
dealing on convenience if you're at the
 
07:04:15.110 --> 07:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
store and you're you're there and your
 
07:04:17.190 --> 07:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
your product that you normally buy is in
 
07:04:19.510 --> 07:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
front of you and it's two or three doll
 
07:04:21.590 --> 07:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
more than what we would charge if you're
 
07:04:22.990 --> 07:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
going to buy a bottle there you're going
 
07:04:25.590 --> 07:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
to buy a bottle there is that much of
 
07:04:30.628 --> 07:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
your sales to to other private to like
 
07:04:32.628 --> 07:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
Market Basket and it's a big piece of
 
07:04:35.070 --> 07:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
what we do I I we can tell you the exact
 
07:04:37.350 --> 07:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
number I don't have it here but Tina
 
07:04:38.990 --> 07:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
probably does in her book but it's a
 
07:04:41.350 --> 07:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's a large piece of what we do okay
 
07:04:43.948 --> 07:04:43.958 align:start position:0%
and then my other question is the um cut
 
07:04:46.388 --> 07:04:46.398 align:start position:0%
that you have 1.4 million per year in
 
07:04:49.468 --> 07:04:49.478 align:start position:0%
collaboration with do that those are
 
07:04:52.110 --> 07:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
pretty big numbers I mean what what does
 
07:04:55.150 --> 07:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
that actually reflect and will that harm
 
07:04:57.910 --> 07:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
you operationally no we've been working
 
07:05:00.910 --> 07:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
with doit for a while on these Cuts we
 
07:05:04.910 --> 07:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
actually as Tina said we went during the
 
07:05:08.350 --> 07:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
during the project of NextGen we we had
 
07:05:12.030 --> 07:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
we got to a a piece in the project
 
07:05:15.430 --> 07:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
where because of the Microsoft based
 
07:05:19.990 --> 07:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
product no one at doit was as familiar
 
07:05:24.190 --> 07:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
with the product as Microsoft itself so
 
07:05:25.110 --> 07:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
what we
 
07:05:28.430 --> 07:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
did they Dennis came to me and said this
 
07:05:30.750 --> 07:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
is not something that we can support we
 
07:05:33.190 --> 07:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the people to support this so
 
07:05:34.910 --> 07:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
you're need you're going to need to go
 
07:05:38.110 --> 07:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
outside to get people to support this
 
07:05:41.670 --> 07:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
Microsoft based product so we stood up
 
07:05:44.190 --> 07:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh an an entity within the commission
 
07:05:47.750 --> 07:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
and Tina went through that piece and now
 
07:05:49.830 --> 07:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
those folks within the Liquor Commission
 
07:05:52.430 --> 07:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
are doing it and we dealt back those
 
07:05:56.310 --> 07:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
positions from doit so it's it was a
 
07:06:00.190 --> 07:06:00.200 align:start position:0%
wash more or less but they basically
 
07:06:02.310 --> 07:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
didn't have the expertise
 
07:06:04.590 --> 07:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
that we went out for bid we went out for
 
07:06:08.350 --> 07:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
an RFP and got a bidder to do part of it
 
07:06:11.030 --> 07:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
and then we are doing part of it inhouse
 
07:06:13.868 --> 07:06:13.878 align:start position:0%
we took some of those folks over the the
 
07:06:16.150 --> 07:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
help Des people specifically we took
 
07:06:18.670 --> 07:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
them we were funding them at doit we
 
07:06:20.270 --> 07:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
move them to the commission and fund
 
07:06:23.628 --> 07:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
them there so and just to answer your
 
07:06:27.030 --> 07:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
question so on premise sales are 95
 
07:06:30.670 --> 07:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
million or 12% of our business and off-
 
07:06:35.150 --> 07:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
premise was about 119 or 15.6% of our
 
07:06:36.590 --> 07:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
business in FY
 
07:06:41.110 --> 07:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
24 and the retail outlets did 547
 
07:06:43.590 --> 07:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
million so they're they're a big piece
 
07:06:45.868 --> 07:06:45.878 align:start position:0%
of what we do and good partners and we
 
07:06:48.150 --> 07:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
work with them closely to make sure that
 
07:06:49.910 --> 07:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know they're profitable in what we
 
07:06:52.468 --> 07:06:52.478 align:start position:0%
do because we recognize that our
 
07:06:55.310 --> 07:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
consumers win regardless of where they
 
07:06:57.548 --> 07:06:57.558 align:start position:0%
buy and if it's convenient for them to
 
07:06:59.628 --> 07:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
buy while they're grocery shopping we
 
07:07:01.750 --> 07:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
completely understand that cuz I always
 
07:07:04.150 --> 07:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
feel guilty if I buy something at a
 
07:07:04.160 --> 07:07:08.350 align:start position:0%
feel guilty if I buy something at a
grocery

07:07:08.350 --> 07:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:11.270 --> 07:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
store did I see representative ms's hand
 
07:07:15.990 --> 07:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
no okay anyone else let me uh yeah let
 
07:07:18.230 --> 07:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
me ask um you mentioned you talked about
 
07:07:21.230 --> 07:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
licensing is all of your licensing of
 
07:07:25.430 --> 07:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
organizations or companies and not of
 
07:07:28.510 --> 07:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
individuals uh well depending on how the
 
07:07:31.948 --> 07:07:31.958 align:start position:0%
businesses are set up we license
 
07:07:34.708 --> 07:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
uh you know we license people all over
 
07:07:37.070 --> 07:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
the country a lot of those licenses are
 
07:07:39.468 --> 07:07:39.478 align:start position:0%
Direct ship licenses so people in
 
07:07:42.590 --> 07:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
California that want to send wine to the
 
07:07:46.430 --> 07:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
state and pay that tax the John Hunt tax
 
07:07:50.310 --> 07:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
as it's known uh that that those people
 
07:07:53.350 --> 07:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
are licensed and a lot of it's kind of a
 
07:07:55.310 --> 07:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
neat program kind of a neat setup
 
07:07:58.468 --> 07:07:58.478 align:start position:0%
because a lot of that wine specifically
 
07:08:01.510 --> 07:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
wine wouldn't be available to Consumers
 
07:08:03.350 --> 07:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
because a lot of those small Niche
 
07:08:06.350 --> 07:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
Vineyards 1 2 3 acres that that wine
 
07:08:09.030 --> 07:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
never leaves the vineyard so that we
 
07:08:11.830 --> 07:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
allow direct ship into the state and
 
07:08:13.948 --> 07:08:13.958 align:start position:0%
that being that we're in a computer age
 
07:08:16.548 --> 07:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
our consumers can go to those websites
 
07:08:18.590 --> 07:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
buy that wine and have it shipped in so
 
07:08:21.910 --> 07:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
it is we're one of 13 states that allows
 
07:08:24.190 --> 07:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
that with wine and we're one of eight
 
07:08:26.310 --> 07:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
states that allows spirits to be shipped
 
07:08:30.070 --> 07:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
in so we're we're pretty far ahead of
 
07:08:31.948 --> 07:08:31.958 align:start position:0%
the game just where I was thinking about
 
07:08:35.590 --> 07:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
here was that we just had oplc in and
 
07:08:38.388 --> 07:08:38.398 align:start position:0%
and the question was came to my mind if
 
07:08:41.590 --> 07:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
any of your licensing would be more more
 
07:08:44.110 --> 07:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
appropriately or more easily done by
 
07:08:46.590 --> 07:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
oplc it doesn't sound like it because
 
07:08:48.468 --> 07:08:48.478 align:start position:0%
they don't license they only license
 
07:08:51.150 --> 07:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who are doing some you know
 
07:08:53.750 --> 07:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
plumbers or whatever but not yeah the
 
07:08:56.270 --> 07:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
the only place we cross pass is if we
 
07:08:58.230 --> 07:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know they license a barber shop and
 
07:09:00.548 --> 07:09:00.558 align:start position:0%
the barber shop wants a liquor license
 
07:09:02.628 --> 07:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
so that's where you know some things
 
07:09:05.388 --> 07:09:05.398 align:start position:0%
would cross paths but it's two separate
 
07:09:07.548 --> 07:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
licenses two separate things
 
07:09:12.430 --> 07:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:17.030 --> 07:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:19.548 --> 07:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
time all right representative Lehman did
 
07:09:21.788 --> 07:09:21.798 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
07:09:24.310 --> 07:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
question okay and do them on the side
 
07:09:27.468 --> 07:09:27.478 align:start position:0%
okay all right I guess we can stop early
 
07:09:28.948 --> 07:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit all right very good we'll
 
07:09:31.388 --> 07:09:31.398 align:start position:0%
see you all next Wednesday thank you Mr
 
07:09:33.350 --> 07:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
