00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 align:start position:0%

yourselves there we go thank you very
 
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
much so good morning uh I'm Stephanie
 
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
Simi I'm the executive director for New
 
00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game um literally just
 
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
under 90 days in this
 
00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
role uh so what we'll be presenting
 
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
today I did not necessarily have a part
 
00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
A Part in participating and developing
 
00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
our budget for our agency but uh I do
 
00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
have with me our business division Chief
 
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
Kathy Lebon and she worked very closely
 
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
with the former director and our senior
 
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
staff uh to develop the agency's budget
 
00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
request and although I'm getting caught
 
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
up I think she's probably the better
 
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
person to answer more detailed questions
 
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
um with that being said though if you
 
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
don't mind I'd like to uh before I turn
 
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
it over to her I'd like to go ahead and
 
00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
provide a brief introduction um our
 
00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 align:start position:0%
agency is mandated as the Guardians of
 
00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 align:start position:0%
the state Fish Wildlife and Marine
 
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
Resources um our mission is to conserve
 
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh manage the and protect the resources
 
00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
their habitats inform the public and
 
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
provide educational opportunities for
 
00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
the public as well as provide
 
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
recreational opportunities for the
 
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
public to appreciate the diverse
 
00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
resources of New Hampshire these natural
 
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
resources of course enrich our lives and
 
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
support New Hampshire's economy um our
 
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
well-being of our citizens is often
 
00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 align:start position:0%
directly connected to getting outdoors
 
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
and enjoying and experiencing
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
nature as I'm sure you're aware um our
 
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities are are becoming more and
 
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
more uh I guess uh requested and a
 
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
division uh people are trying to be uh
 
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
utilize more diverse re resources uh
 
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
these natural resources of course like I
 
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
said Ure enrich our lives and I'm sure
 
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
you're aware we are facing new
 
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
challenges as we're trying to meet the
 
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
demands and increasing pressure on our
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
Fish Wildlife and natural resources uh
 
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
we're facing issues Across the Nation
 
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
and particularly in the Northeast with
 
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
disease uh climate resilience declining
 
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
species and populations and habitat
 
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
changes um all of these of course when I
 
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
say habitat changes I mean land air and
 
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
water we are facing a variety of these
 
00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
factors and and as an agency mandated to
 
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
work on these species and work on these
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
habitats we must monitor we must study
 
00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
we must manage these uh to ensure the
 
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
sustainability of our Fish Wildlife
 
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
Marine Resources for not just their
 
00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
existence but the enjoyment of our
 
00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
residents and the enrichment of our
 
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
economy our core functions as an agency
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
are primarily funded through hunting and
 
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
fishing license sales we've built a
 
00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
strong relationship with partnering
 
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
agencies and stakeholders which some of
 
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
you are very familiar with this was
 
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
Illustrated in the final report of the
 
00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
committee of the committee to study fish
 
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
and game department funding and
 
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
Partnerships which was released November
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
1st thank you representative for
 
00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
that um through those Partnerships we've
 
00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 align:start position:0%
been able to leverage some of the
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
increasing demands but certainly not all
 
00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 align:start position:0%
uh we realize that we're working
 
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
diligently to look for other options but
 
00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
on average across the northeastern fish
 
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
and wildlife agencies 70% of the
 
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated Revenue um is generated
 
00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
through the licensed sales and through
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
federal grants uh the remaining 30% is
 
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
through other sources and this is of
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
course the northeastern region um
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated General funds permit fees
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
specialty stamps and Lottery there's a
 
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
plethora of other ideas that other
 
00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
states have been using um and we're
 
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
exploring some of those fortunately for
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
us in New Hampshire the public interest
 
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
and desire for fish and wildlife and
 
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
Marine Resources continues to grow uh
 
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately like I said earlier the
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
needs and responsibilities and the cost
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
of doing business also continue to grow
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
um as New Hampshire's population
 
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
increases the pressure on our natural
 
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
resources increase and I've walked into
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
an agency and I have discovered that we
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
have very very skilled and dedicated
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
staff in this agency I've worked in many
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
other agencies and I will say this
 
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
agency is filled with I think some of
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
the most dedicated people I've seen the
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
staff continue to work and think outside
 
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
of the box they're looking for ways to
 
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
improve our efficiencies build
 
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative relationships and utilize
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
other other funding sources just outside
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
of the standard federal grants and
 
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
matching we recognize efficiency is
 
00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
essential particularly in this time uh
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
so we also continue to maximize every
 
00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity and seek to generate uh use
 
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
of matching funds where available we're
 
00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
in the process of reviewing and
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
streamlining several of our processes
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
internal processes programs we're
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
intensifying our collaborative work with
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
other agencies I've been really
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
headstrong on ensuring that we're
 
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
coordinating with other agencies and uh
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
we're also reviewing our current
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
Staffing models and assessing our
 
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
long-standing self-funded approach and
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
seeking ways to enhance the agency's
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
ability to generate Revenue the ficient
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
game department is marking 160 years in
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
existence I can't say that I've been
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
here that whole time but I'm really
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
proud of the fact that it's reaching 160
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
years uh we manage over 140 boat ramps
 
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
over 64,000 Acres of Wildlife Management
 
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
areas conservation easements we host
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
hunting and engling and outdoor
 
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
education programs uh we survey and
 
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
manage Fish Wildlife and Marine
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
Resources for long-term viability as
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
well as the recreational opportunity we
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
work with private land owners to enhance
 
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
their Landscapes and provide
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities for recreation to the
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
public we have one of the finest if not
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
one if not the finest conservation law
 
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement programs in the nation it's
 
00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
recognized nationally
 
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
and as a new director I will continue to
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
support the need and examine alternative
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
approaches for Revenue sources although
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
I am going to be honest I'm realistic in
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
knowing that we aren't likely to uh fill
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
the entire Gap without your
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
support the uh agency itself we we're
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
operating on a fairly tight budget um as
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
I arrived here I realized there were
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
quite a few critical needs that I had
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
not anticipated um we have a critical
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
need for permanency of our uh much
 
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 align:start position:0%
needed environmental review staff which
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
were currently under they're currently
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
funded under arpa we have extensive
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and Technology
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
modernization needs um one of my primary
 
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
objectives this year is to try to
 
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:17.879 align:start position:0%
improve our it and our
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
technology we did meet the 4% decrease
 
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
requested however if there are further
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
Financial cuts to uh our funding and no
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
additional support through unrestricted
 
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 align:start position:0%
or general funds or even new innovative
 
00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
ways we are likely going to need to
 
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
review and cut some Services as a new
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
director this this hurts my heart I I
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to uh do this as an agency
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
mandated to serve the public and our
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
natural resources reducing Services is
 
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
very concerning and will result in
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
collateral and direct negative impacts
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
not just to our natural resources and
 
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
our economy but but to the public who
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
want to utilize and and value these
 
00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
Resources with that being said I I thank
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
you for your time and thank you for your
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
support and your assistance as we work
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
through this I will turn it over to
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
details with you thank you very much

thank
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you director good morning I am
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
Kathy leonti chief of the business
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
Division and this is my 11th budget
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
submission for the New Hampshire fishing
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
game department so I've been in this
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
role for a very long period of
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
time well I'm going to speak to
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
developing the budget in some specifics
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
of that while we were in the development
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
of the budget we were able to meet the
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
governor's general fund
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
targets however we will we were not able
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
to meet the governor's targets for the
 
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.519 align:start position:0%
use of fishing game funds to do so would
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
have meant considerable cuts to programs
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
and services the budget director allowed
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
us to utilize unrestricted fishing game
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
funds to create this banal budget and
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
doing that it we only have approximately
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the um um financial statement
 
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.750 align:start position:0%
looking at the um um financial statement
approximately

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
$100,000 remaining in the fishing game
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
fund at the end of this
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
bium uh um I'm
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
sorry so each year this budget uses
 
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
greater than $18 million in fishing game
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
funds to sustain our programs and our
 
00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.350 align:start position:0%
funds to sustain our programs and our
staff

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
however our unrestricted Revenue
 
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
expectation is only approximately $14
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
million leaving a deficit of over $4
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
million in each year hence that's why we
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
use a surplus to get through this budget
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
we currently have
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
193 full-time employees five of which
 
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
are unfunded and remain unfunded in the
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
2627 banial budget request we do have a
 
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
small small amount of General funds
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
within this budget it comprises
 
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.470 align:start position:0%
within this budget it comprises
approximately

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
3.5% of our entire overall
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
Appropriations each
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
year when we come before you after the
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
governor's budget is released I'm sure
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
that we will have more indepth
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
discussions and certainly if you have
 
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
any questions relative to our agency
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
budget submission I would be more than
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
questions that's representative Murray
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead and you just you can just go
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
ahead you don't need to you don't need
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
to keep asking me just go ahead and run
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
the run the list all right um let's see
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
easy one first what's the most impactful
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
disease that you're dealing with and
 
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
what does it take to
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
um deal with that disease well right now
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
there're two primary obviously we're
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent the um influx of uh oh
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
my gosh just chronic wasting thank you
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
chronic wasting
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
disease chronic wasting it's in ulates
 
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
particularly dear um and they just
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
actually had some new sightings in
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
Southeastern us which is unfortunate but
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
we've been successful in minimizing the
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
invasion of that I'll say Invasion
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
because it's a disease and we don't want
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
it coming in so we spend a lot of time
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
time and and effort ensuring that we're
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
protecting our our ulate herd and
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
testing for the disease to ensure that's
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's not here the other is hemorrhagic
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
disease which is common in in rabbits
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
and hairs and we also do testing uh for
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
well um about the the hike Safe program
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking in particular of it well it
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
seems to me you can correct me if I'm
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
wrong um there have been an I know this
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
is also going to spill over into safety
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
um some serious rescues and several
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
quite a few death it seems like more
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
deaths than usual um a lot of these
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
people are totally unprepared they're
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
not listening to what it takes to hike
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
in the in the whites um I have sort of
 
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
two questions one is um there was the
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
fellow who broke into the snow cat with
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
his dog and um was rescued and took off
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
this was someone who's totally
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
unprepared and there are all sorts of
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
things about save The Dog leave the kid
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
behind um how do you track this person
 
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
down cuz it sound like he kind of left
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
in a rush track him down because this is
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
certainly someone who should have paid
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
for his
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
rescue yeah I don't know how do you know
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
how Colonel manages that our Colonel um
 
00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan would be able to answer
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
that we could get you an answer how what
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
he does and what the procedure is for
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
that I don't know exactly what they do I
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
know they worked collaboratively with
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
the uh ntion the federal system up there
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
because they were actually contact
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
through them and then they worked with
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
the local enforcement but I don't know
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
the exact procedure we'll get back to
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
you on that one yeah the other one there
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
was a a well um an experienced hiker who
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
um you know called out for help and he
 
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
just could not make it but he was one
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
who was totally well prepared um can you
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
with regards to some of that can you
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
speak to the um what the hike Safe
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
program um is that still like a $35 is
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
that something that could go up because
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
um we have ours um and I'm wondering has
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
that program grown because it seems like
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
a really fabulous program the hike safe
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
program has gone well beyond anybody's
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
expectations when it was first um put
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
out there it's $25 for an individual $35
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
for a family we anticipated at the onset
 
00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:19.959 align:start position:0%
of that that we might get around
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 a year it has tripled we we we
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
now receive over $300,000 per year for
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
that voluntary hike Safe program it has
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
been extremely successful for the
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
Department are out ofate people
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
encouraged to get this how do they know
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
that they should do this we do a
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
significant amount of advertising for
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
the hike safe card and to hike
 
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.870 align:start position:0%
the hike safe card and to hike
responsive

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
responsive
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
responsibly to be upfront as well I just
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with Taylor Caswell
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
and we talked about how we could promote
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
this further and a couple of other
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
factors with our agency through his his
 
00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.910 align:start position:0%
factors with our agency through his his
agency

00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
um many of the people who end up in
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
distress honestly are from out of state
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
and just not familiar with the
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
ruggedness of the terrain and and the
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
conditions that change so quickly up
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
there of course they are
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
right of course of
 
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
course representative Pap thank you Mr
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
chairman hi um thank you for being here
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the willingness of my
 
00:15:26.829 --> 00:15:26.839 align:start position:0%
colleague to let me jump in in the
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
middle of her question it's just a
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
related topic where it would make sense
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
to talk about them at the same time one
 
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
of the things that we were talking in
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
the committee that you referred to
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
earlier was a similar program for
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
boating which obviously would present
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
different logistical challenges and I
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
was curious to hear any thoughts you may
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
have on that just because it ties
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
straight into what my colleague was
 
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.829 align:start position:0%
straight into what my colleague was
talking

00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
about I think you mentioned some of the
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
logistical challenges those are they're
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
pretty they're not just um surface
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
challenges they're they're rather deep
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
and complex and so working through that
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
process will take time I'm not sure that
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple of agencies that
 
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:08.839 align:start position:0%
would be involved obviously uh you
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
probably are familiar with that I'm sure
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
you guys had greater depth conversations
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
about that topic um it's certainly not
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
off the table I'm not saying that it's
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
off the table right now I'm I'm
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
considering all factions and all all
 
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
ideas um but other than that we have not
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
we have not I've only 90 days here we
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
have not sat down to say hey we're going
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
to go forward with this we do have a
 
00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
long list um my staff continue to bring
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
ideas and we'll be meeting as a senior
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
staff to start going through that list
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
and looking at ways we might generate
 
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.509 align:start position:0%
and looking at ways we might generate
more

00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
Revenue representative Murray sorry
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
continue please oh I should have turned
 
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
this up thank you um during Co you had a
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
boon in licenses seems like everybody
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
was out fishing and hunting and then it
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
dropped down after Co where are you on
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
kind of that curve uh with licenses have
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
that come back are you seeing an
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
increase in licenses we we had yeah I am
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
on we had a couple of years
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
um 20 and 21 calendar year 20 and 21
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
were very high looking at the scale it
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
went way up we have now leveled off to
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
the same dollars approximately where we
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
were prior to
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
covid and and if I may that's um fairly
 
00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:26.919 align:start position:0%
common Across the Nation with the fish
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
and wildlife agencies I've spoken with
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
some of my counterparts in other states
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
and they're seeing a similar Trend okay
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
did I understand you said you had five
 
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.870 align:start position:0%
did I understand you said you had five
unfunded

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
employees correct unfilled and unfunded
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
they're unfilled as well okay so that
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
was oh yeah they have to be unfilled
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
they're unfunded when you said that I
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
thought I must be mishearing something
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
here so thank you for that that was easy
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
um the moose population um how you
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
seeing that continue to decline I mean
 
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:56.919 align:start position:0%
we don't have moose in the southern part
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
of the State anymore and I wondered this
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
seems seems different from the problem
 
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
that the deer have with the ulet with
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
the Moose it's the tick the Moose is
 
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
it's a very different situation right
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
now we have an ongoing research project
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
that is looking at uh assessing the
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
population and and using different
 
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
methodologies to gain a population
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
estimate we should have more of that
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
soon thank you and I know that you're
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
new but you know the the elephant in the
 
00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:22.039 align:start position:0%
room be here all day um how will Trump's
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
halting of all grants impact you what
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
programs are impacted with that you
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
know you want to talk was quite a scare
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday we do that yesterday yes um
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
certainly you know our agency is is
 
00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
relying on federal funding grants
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
matches um we did a a cost estimate just
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
if we were to have to survive through
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
the next five months and Kathy can get
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
into the details on that if you want to
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
share how you assessed it the next five
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
months if we were to have to go without
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
any federal Grant reimbursement would
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
cost the department5 to5 A5 million doll
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
we fund a significant amount of our
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
funds and most of those federal funds
 
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
upwards of 70% of them are for salary
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
and benefits of the Personnel that work
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
in those
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
programs so those people would lose jobs
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
or would they would you would continue
 
00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:24.390 align:start position:0%
or would they would you would continue
them

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
and it depends we have the authority
 
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
right your appropriation your budget you
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
have your Authority what would happen if
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
we were unable to bring in those Federal
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursements it would hit the fishing
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
game fund so the fishing game fund would
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
have to make up that deficit and it
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
would be depleted before we even get to
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
next year's budget yeah it would be
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
depleted it would be gone thank you I'm
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
done I'm
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
set just one moment um at what rate do
 
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
those funds flow in are they just
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
flowing in on a regular if things are
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
normal are they coming on a monthly
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
basis weekly basis quarterly bi-weekly
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
we draw Down based upon the payroll
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
payroll thank you um yes representative
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
D thank you for coming today I have two
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
questions for you one I I know there's a
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
bill that's out about disease for bait
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
in my area a lot of our because we're on
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
a lake we have a lot of businesses that
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
sell bait can you please explain to me
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
what disease is coming in from other
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
states that we don't already have in our
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
water I'm confused by it yeah so the
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
bill I can get you more details from our
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries division Chief however
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
the bill is um not one that we are
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about or not necessarily
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
supportive of it because we don't see
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
the ne the need for it at this point um
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that we do quite a bit for
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring and ensuring that we have
 
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
healthy populations of both Fish and
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Resources okay thank you you're
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
very welcome second question I live on a
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
lake I see a lot of boats com in from
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
other Town other cities and states they
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to have a license they can
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
just come in and because they're
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
apparently their state doesn't have
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
licensing is that another way that we
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
can make Revenue by requiring that those
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
that are coming in because we have
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
people at the station to check for you
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
know plants
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
um to get some revenue from out of state
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
we do not oversee boat registrations
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's under the department of
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
safety and if they come in from another
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
state they should be registered in that
 
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
state that would be a surprise to me
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
that they are not registered in that
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
state there a lot of States like Montana
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
and others that don't have you don't
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
have to register your boat but it end
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
ends up being a problem but what I'm
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
thinking of more is our water and the
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
contaminants that are going in our water
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
from our tourists coming in and God I
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
love our tourists because they pay a lot
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
of wages here in the Hampshire right but
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
there must be a revenue stream there
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere that um that we can get to
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
help testing the waters and and
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
protecting um you know our environment
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
so just a thought so certainly just I
 
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:23.559 align:start position:0%
would this is just my thought that would
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
be for testing of the water and
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the water would be the
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services we
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
do not do anything like that and the
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
registrations are through the department
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
of safety we do not have a hand in that
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
however our department does receive $5
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
per registration of every registered vat
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire that
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
goes into the public boat access program
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
right and we have um our fishing game
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
right there in New Durham so I'm always
 
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
talking to those people about all of the
 
00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
things that they need so just trying to
 
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:57.799 align:start position:0%
think of another Revenue stream that
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
might we appreciate that we appreciate
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
much

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
continue um just one quick clarification
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
when representative Earth was asking
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
about the frequency of federal fund draw
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
Downs MH we were talking about the
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we received when you
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
said it was bi-weekly right not the way
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
you disperse money that you got from the
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
federal F correct okay so we get them at
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
the same frequency as we disburs them
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
more or less yes with a time lapse like
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
our our federal reimbursements are based
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
on actual payroll and any other expenses
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
that are incurred during that two-e
 
00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
period of time it's all rolled up
 
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
together so that reimbursement could
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
come in two three weeks after the
 
00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:51.559 align:start position:0%
expenses are incurred yes cool so a
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
couple of things that I did want to ask
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
about one that I noticed when I was
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
looking at your budgets we're talking
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
about revenues from licenses yes and I
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
noticed that in previous years the the
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
department tended to budget a larger
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
Revenue amount from those licenses than
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
one would have reasonably estimated from
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
the trends may I ask you know how do you
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
project those revenues when you budget
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
for them because sometimes I would see a
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
line that's straight we get exactly the
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
same amount and then the budget for the
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
revenue was a million
 
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0%
higher any thoughts on that for just
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
strictly Li es if I recall correctly yes
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
of course we don't have a presentation
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
and the numbers in front of us so I have
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
to count on my memory but that's my
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
recollection of it and if you don't
 
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the answer right now
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine but when we come back later
 
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
I would appreciate it if we could talk
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
about that I can absolutely tell you how
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
I budget for licenses I have the exact
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
dollar amount in every single
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue category that has
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
come in for the past 15 20 years
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
we have to take into account when there
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
is a license fee increase that that
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
would certainly skew those numbers and
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
being able to average
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
that I I would be surprised if the
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
revenue had had a million dooll
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
difference I I would like to see a
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
little more detail on that
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
representative if possible and then I
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
could provide you a better answer of
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
course we'll follow up when at the right
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
time yes I just wanted to give you a
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
heads up
 
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
you know as I told you last fall when
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
were in the committee I want to make
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
sure you have plenty of time to prepare
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
what the committee needs for the
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
budgeting so that there are no surprises
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we don't like asking for
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
stuff at the last moment so yeah please
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
so could you actually just answer the
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
question about projection let's say
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's no Revenue increase how do you
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
budget i a i average actually um and I
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
have that sheet we had to present Monday
 
00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:05.559 align:start position:0%
to house ways and means and I had this
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
in my bag that I carry and I actually
 
00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
have all of the pockets of unrestricted
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue including licenses going all the
 
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
way back just for this sheet 2013 but my
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet has it going certainly much
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
further back than that so um what I do
 
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
to budget those revenues is I look at
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
the trend
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
but I also look at as a perfect example
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
our interest on savings deposits used to
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
be way up here then it came way down
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
here and crashed so I had to budget
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
appropriately for that Trend that was
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
occurring we saw a huge increase in
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
interest earnings due to all of the
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
funds the arpa funds sitting in the uh
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
State's coffers so we receive a portion
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
of those the fish and game fund portion
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
of those interest earnings so I actually
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
came before house Ways and Means last uh
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
for the current budget we're in and
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
recommended that we increase that
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
because we were going to earn much more
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
than what had been originally budgeted
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
so you have to make your tweaks like
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
that and I assume you do that up and
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
down you're watching both ways
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
RBS on hack PHS thank you Mr chair and
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
just continue through great um I am
 
00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
thankful that you're here and willing to
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
answer questions today um I'm just
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could talk about a
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
little bit about um gifts that might
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
come to the fishing game department and
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
you know what is the process for
 
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
accepting those gifts um I'm just
 
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
looking for a little background any type
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
of gifts like a tangible item or a
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
financial component yeah give me give me
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
what you know okay want me take that
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay so we are always open to donations
 
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
at the department and we have a
 
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated account called the gifts and
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
donations account which is in the
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
budgetary area of the office of the
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
director and back in 2018 we actually
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
had a gentleman from the state of
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who passed away and left
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
us over $300,000 to be used for
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
Department operations the majority of
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
financial gifts coming into the
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
department have a direction that they go
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
into someone's putting it to search and
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
rescue someone's putting it to Aquatic
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
education or Hunter education if they
 
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
come in with just Department operations
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
then we can use that for broad
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
Department operations any gift coming
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
into the department has to be approved
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
by the fishing Game Commission and any
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
monetary or tangible gift with a value
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
of $2500 or over has to go to governor
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
and Council for approval with a tangible
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
gift that comes then couple years back
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
we received a million dooll boat for the
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement division to be used out
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
on the coast and that was a donated boat
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
to the department and we brought it in
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
through the governor and Council process
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's put on our
 
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
inventory so with tangible items we do
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
we receive a lot of tangible items you
 
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
might be surprised from snow machines
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
trailers that big giant
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
people like the fishing game department
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
they want to give in some way
 
00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
yeah you're
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
welcome you may represent Pap thank you
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so again something that
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
we've talked about last fall but this is
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
a new setting um I believe you recall
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
that I told you the story of my daughter
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
who in June was trying to get a
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
Trapper's license because she's
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
interested in wildlife and zoology and
 
00:29:56.509 --> 00:29:56.519 align:start position:0%
the next opportunity to get a license
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
was somewhere in September so she gave
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
up on that because by September she was
 
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
in Ohio studying zoology and Wildlife I
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
also believe you recall my uh
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
discussions with you about how every
 
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:11.799 align:start position:0%
time when I'd like to register to get a
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
hunter's license and I'm not even a
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
hunter I'm just trying to go through the
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
process and give you some money and have
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
my card all the classes were full and
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
while a class was added at some point it
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
promptly filled up too and then it
 
00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:30.039 align:start position:0%
remained full I also have and this is a
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
new fact since then since I mentioned
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
this to a couple of people there are
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
quite a few other people that came back
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
to me and expressed the same frustration
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
about being unable to get a license
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
because the classes are full and they
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
fill up and then they are full so given
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
that the department would get direct
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
revenue from the new licenses which then
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
presumably would be renewed most of them
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
and also Pitman Robertson funds are uh
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
distributed based on the number of
 
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.789 align:start position:0%
distributed based on the number of
licensed

00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hunters have you given thought to
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
finding a way to always have a class
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
open somewhere in the state so we don't
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue so yes I've given it thought to
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
offer more classes I I wouldn't say
 
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily it's to always have a class
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
open you know every day of the year
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's quite extensive how ever um I've
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
been working with our public affairs uh
 
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
division Chief and we've been talking
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
about different ways to foster more
 
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
Outreach and education efforts which
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
included extending or expanding our
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
opportunities for trapping and hunting
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
education courses uh we do have a
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
facility the owl Brook facility is a
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
great facility for Hunter education and
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
I just got a chance to finally visit
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
that facility and I was quite impressed
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
by it and I want to
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're actually utilizing
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
it to our maximum because it's it's
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
quite a lovely facility that we have
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's an honor to have it in our agency
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
if I make quickly followup if I owl
 
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
Brook owl Brook Hunter education center
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
if I may add that Hunter Ed Trapper Ed
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
and Aquatic Ed are run very heavily on
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
volunteers for the department and their
 
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
volunteer time is used to match those PR
 
00:32:23.639 --> 00:32:25.190 align:start position:0%
volunteer time is used to match those PR
funds

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
and when you when you run a program with
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
volunteers I mean we utilize them as
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
much as we possibly can we do not have
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
sufficient Staffing within the
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
department to be able to offer all of
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
those courses on our own so we rely
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
heavily upon volunteers to to assist us
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
with that yeah that's an excellent point
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
Kathy and you know to the point of the
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
volunteers we have equated about
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
$680,000 worth of volunteer time in the
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
last year which equates to $1.8 million
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
in match for us so it's quite an
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
extensive program it's a it's a
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
successful effort unfortunately we're
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
not meeting the demand as I said the
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
demands are rising right and the cost to
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
do business is also rising and so it's
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
trying to find that that middle ground
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
where we can meet the demand and still
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
be efficient and and effective in what
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing I appreciate your
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
perspective and just as a quick followup
 
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
right I want to clarify that I wasn't
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
asking obvious for classes to be running
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
every day it's okay if they run 3 weeks
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
from now I would feel that I I think
 
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
that it would be beneficial to the
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
department overall to always have some
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
availability in a class in a few weeks
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
because again for going Revenue it's not
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
just the money right we disappoint
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
people the people who are trying to
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
serve who get frustrated trust me my kid
 
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't very ecstatic about not being
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
able to trap legally and I told her you
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
got to do it by the book I'm not going
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
to have you go in the Backwoods and just
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
set a trap hoping nobody finds it right
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
we don't do that same thing for you know
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
families of five who all want a license
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
and there are two spots open and now
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
what you know and I know that is
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
difficult trust me we did have those
 
00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
discussions I appreciate the
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
difficulties I'm aware of that but at
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
the end of the
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
day expenses keep increasing and
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
revenues don't keep up and it seems that
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
we really need to focus a lot on every
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity possible possible to keep
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
increasing those revenues so I would
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
urge you to uh give it you know more
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
thought and attention because I think
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
it's an opportunity to ease some of that
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
you know budget Crunch and if I may uh
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm good represent
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you um my question is when
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
was the last time that your license fees
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
increase I believe it was 2008
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
but I I think it was I think it was
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
2018 it
 
00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:07.030 align:start position:0%
2018 it
was

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
$10 for the major licenses like a a
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
plain old hunting license and a fishing
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
license we did not do a license increase
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
across the
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
board the issue with raising our license
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
fees to meet our expenses ex just to
 
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying the
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
increase was $10 or the it was increased
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
to $10 no the increase was $10 for each
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
type so from what to what sort of thing
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
well for a fishing was went from 34 to
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
44 thank you sorry representative Kelly
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
continue I'm sorry um the the issue with
 
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
increasing license fees to keep up with
 
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures is we are already very high
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
in comparison to our surrounding states
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're either first or second in cost for
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
our license types and if someone from
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
Connecticut wants to go North to go
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
hunting and Maine has a cheaper price
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to go to Maine they're not
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
going to come to New
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if I may one additional
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
component to that is is not the license
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
fees but maybe like the habitat fee for
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
example the habitat fee was introduced
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
in 1999 at $250 it remains at
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
$2.50 for the last 25 years so it hasn't
 
00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:29.079 align:start position:0%
met the inflation and that's one area
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
where I think you know we could maybe
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
consider a different approach to that so
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
we have a couple of things like that
 
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
that we could consider without impacting
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
the license fees and still keeping our
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
Fishers and hunters in New
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just one moment so would you
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation not right now
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily but to to us regarding what
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
you would want to possibly do with a
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
habitat fee give us give us some ideas
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
there thank you representative Kelly I'm
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
sorry that was that was what I was going
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
to ask but if there are other things
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
similar to that can you provide a list
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely do you want to keep
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
going yeah go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
so one question that again probably we
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
won't get into a detailed answer now but
 
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
at least I'd like to get a head start on
 
00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.349 align:start position:0%
at least I'd like to get a head start on
it

00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
is your budget seems to have bumped a
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
bit in the recent years right
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
and I'm already aware of the whole 10%
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
rise for all state state employees part
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
right so that's a known issue and I'm
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
sure that since we discussed that uh two
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
years ago everybody on the committee is
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
familiar with the fact that you know
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
that was a raise needy to keep up with
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
inflation and you have a challenge with
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
the revenues not necessarily keeping up
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
got that but what else you know hit that
 
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
budget to um increase it because it
 
00:37:59.550 --> 00:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
seems to have uh grown significantly
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
recently you know the last year or two
 
00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.510 align:start position:0%
recently you know the last year or two
or

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
three salary and benefits certainly is
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
the major components and as well as
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
other agencies salary and benefits have
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
gone up so our transfer to
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
doit increases substantially to pay for
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
their salary and benefit increase our
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
transfer over to das increases
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
substantially to pay for their salary
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
and benefit increase so it's not just a
 
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
salary and benefit increase for our
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
employees it's for other state agency
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
employees as well thank you and for the
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
benefit of everybody else because I know
 
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
we talked more about it last fall but
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
the committee other committee members
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
haven't heard could you detail a bit
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
more the nature of the transfers to it
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
andd just so that everybody has the
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
background so you know what do you pay
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
them for and how much generally are they
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
paid and so on for future meetings or
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
for right now if you can give something
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
right now it can also wait until future
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
meetings whichever way you are more
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable I I don't want to you know
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
put you on the spot but if you have
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
something now that would be great if you
 
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
want to follow up later that's also
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine well fishing game just
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
like All State agencies are under the
 
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
umbrella of having all it be under the
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
department of Information Technology and
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
if you look at budget increases you can
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
look at the last 10 or 15 years and you
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
will see how that budget has gone up
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
support if I may on uh increases outside
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
of what is the greatest factor here
 
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
which we just discussed there are other
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
increases we are experiencing just
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
supplies that we need for doing our
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
business the economy obviously there's
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
been inflation in the economy and that's
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know we used to pay $2 a fence post
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
and now we're paying $12 a fence post
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things that also
 
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
escalates our buz budget as an example
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
shipping cost which we do a significant
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
amount of shipping we ship out to our
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
license agents we we have a lot of
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
40% and certainly supplies
 
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
utilities we have we have six fish
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
hatcheries four Regional Offices two
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
education C centers I cannot even begin
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
to describe the volume of electric bills
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
that we have oil bills that we have and
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
all of those items have gone up
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
substantially just like they have in our
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
lives just one moment so what is it
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're shipping you shipping you have so
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
much shipping we have a a lot of
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
shipping we ship our all of our
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
regulations and digest out to our
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
licensing agents I just paid a bill of
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
over $3,000 to FedEx for the new um
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
hunting digest or licensed digest yeah
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh I I would have a whole list so have
 
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.309 align:start position:0%
uh I I would have a whole list so have
you

00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
considered dropping the paper and
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
getting more electronic for your
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
training stuff and all that well you are
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
seeing my here sir I would love to do
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
that we to be honest with you our agency
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
is behind the times on our technology
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
and that's where we really need to have
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
some support and be able to work with
 
00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
doit and get us up to speed I I have
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
regions that are not connected to the
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
state server and that is not conducive
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
to doing business well no so that's one
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
of my priorities is working on
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
technology and innovation of how we run
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
our systems great so again when you come
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
before us please let talk about that and
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
tell us what's going on there and what
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
could how you think you could improve in
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
that area and what support you need to
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
do that absolutely thank you
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative Papi thank you and again
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
to rehash something that we spoke about
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the fall which uh I told you that
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
will you know come up during the budget
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
meetings um we spoke a lot when we
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
talked about the need for increased
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue about the um
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for fish and game that
 
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
were not original in your statute but
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
have been added over time and I believe
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
the statements from the agency at the
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
time were that we keep giving you new
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but we don't give you
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
the funding for it and we discussed
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
about the costs and if I recall
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
correctly the um estimate that I got in
 
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
the last memo I got from you was about
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
30% of your
 
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
costs I would really appreciate as I
 
00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
asked you then a more detailed break
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
breakdown and what those obligations are
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
that we have added to the agency but not
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
funded because we spoke a lot about the
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
need to um make sure that the money we
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
collect from the hunters and Fishers
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
from your clients go to serve those
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
people and how we really don't want to
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
have the hunters pay for search and
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
rescue for example one of the examples
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
that comes to mind is again we spoke
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
about the search and rescue report that
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
you provide to fiscal committee which
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
appears to indicate the program is
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
self-funded and works fine but in our
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
discussions it was mentioned that we are
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
only you you guys are only reporting the
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
direct costs not the indirect costs and
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
then how would we know you need more
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
funds if you know according to the
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
reports we have you don't have a need
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
there so things like that I would highly
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
encourage you to make sure you have
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
detailed data on because they would be
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
critical in determining you know our
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
ability to support those programs and to
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
maybe start working towards addressing
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
any wrongs the legislator May
 
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
legislature may have committed over time
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
but to address them we got to understand
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
them understand their impact in detail
 
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so I just for the benefit of the
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
committee for your own benefit I wanted
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
you to I want I wanted to remind you
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
what again we spoke about some months
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
ago about the need for those details and
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
lists and you know I would I believe it
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
was Colonel Jordan Who provided that 30%
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
figure indeed but as we spoke then I
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
appreciated the quick effort to give us
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
something but that is very very um much
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
not the kind of detail that we expect
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
right that was a back of the envelope
 
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
estimate we appreciated it because it's
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
the best the colonal could do at the
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
time but you guys should have much more
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
detailed on that type of information you
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
know in order for us to figure out the
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
right you know amount we can buy budget
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you we do thank you very
 
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
much I appreciate that
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
Insight I should be good for
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
now representative
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair can I follow
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
up on something because I got a little
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
confused um I got the impression from
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
the discussion that a class is required
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
for a hunting license I mean there are
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
lots of any what about there are
 
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
experienced Hunters um who have been
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
hunting all their lives they still have
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
to take a class every year or how long
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
does it's a one can you just tell me
 
00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559 align:start position:0%
it's a Once in a-lifetime class it's
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%
called a hunter education
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
class and you can take it in another
 
00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
state and as long as you show proof of
 
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
that Hunter education class you do not
 
00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
have to take it in the state of New
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but a hunter education class
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
is a requirement prior to receiving a
 
00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:49.990 align:start position:0%
is a requirement prior to receiving a
hunting

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
license but then you can renew your
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
license after that oh yes absolutely
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely yeah you don't
 
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
lifetime uh representative
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
dry can that not be done through Zoom or
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
do you have to physically have the
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
person there because you're handling
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
guns there's a physical component
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
there's a physical component most one
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
day physical uh component it's called a
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
field day field day field day yeah good
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
you represent M Kelly thank you to
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
follow up on that who runs the program
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
the hunting
 
00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
program the public affairs division has
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
a hunter education program with several
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
staff who work the hunter education
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
program so that is run through our
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
division represent Murray thank you
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
again um it seems like the funding from
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
that comes from the it's federal aid and
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
Wildlife restoration act would that is
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
that funds are those funds at risk uh
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
with this holding all federal funds so
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
would this facility necessarily or
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
possibly have to shut down if you don't
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
have that or you'd be able to keep it
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
open and is this also potential um
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source I'm always you know with
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
um representative I'm sorry I'm sorry
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um is this a possibility for
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
classrooms you and education for high
 
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:21.559 align:start position:0%
school students or something are there
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
classes that could come there and take
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
just a a wildlife class as part of their
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum which would potentially be a
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
small Revenue Stream So the last part of
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
your question about the wildlife
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum our public affairs unit and
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
their team is currently looking into
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
that and working with I mean they have
 
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
some already constructed curriculums
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
constructed for different programs and
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
well the uh the first part of your
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
question as far as yes this could be
 
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
impacted what does that mean for us I I
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not Doom day I I try to be positive
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
here and I try to look on ways that we
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
might be able to um you know get through
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
situations that we're dealing with the
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
the one interesting point about the
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
current federal funding pause is that
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
there are some clear things that have
 
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
been articulated and right now we do not
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
seem to fall under those so we may be
 
00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
okay uh I'm counting on that I'm I'm
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
putting all my energy and positive
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
thought in that direction uh if it were
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
to come through where it does affect us
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
we will certainly make some contingency
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
planning and we'll see what that that
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
welcome you mentioned you did a ways and
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
means presentation recently it sounded
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
like you actually had a slide
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
presentation for that no not a slide
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
just a handout a handout okay but a hand
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
out what you must have produced
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
electronically um you printed that from
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
a document yeah yeah could you send the
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
docu the electronic document to to
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
Mickey sure I I did provide it to cret
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
Mickey we we do have it posted online as
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
a ways and means document but I will
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
send it to the committee so you have
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
that just okay send me a link that'd be
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
Dy forgive me for asking this question
 
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm always thinking about silos
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
silos you provide a service to your
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
constituents here or our consti consents
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
in the state of Main and other
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
areas do we think in the process of each
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
one of these silos should be self funded
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
from the activity that we're doing like
 
00:49:41.069 --> 00:49:41.079 align:start position:0%
the hiking the fishing all of those
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
components all the expenses should be
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
offset by the revenue that you bring in
 
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:47.799 align:start position:0%
from th those particular activities do
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
we and and I sorry I worked in
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing so I never worked in your
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
line of work um do you think in those
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
terms we do have have many areas of
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
programs that are funded exactly the way
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
in which you're speaking of such as
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated accounts like ohrv funds come
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
into ohrv which is a very large
 
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
component of our budget funds in that in
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
that account are strictly used to fund
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
that program the wildlife habitat
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
program funds within that account are
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
strictly used to fund that program we
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
have 16 dedic ated accounts within the
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
department that are strictly funded that
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
way however if you take us by division
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
and you take the Fisheries the Inland
 
00:50:38.079 --> 00:50:39.470 align:start position:0%
and you take the Fisheries the Inland
Fisheries

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
Fisheries
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
division there's a great need there for
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
funding right now in our Hatchery
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we do not have enough
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
revenues coming in through all of our
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
programs to cover the needs that are in
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
the Fisheries division
 
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
Wildlife however uses a small amount of
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
unrestricted fishing game funds because
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
there is a large component of federal
 
00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
funds and dedicated funds within that
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
Division if you were to look in your
 
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
budget books so the wildlife division
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
more than pays for the Wildlife division
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
so it's very hard when you have
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
divisions into put them in those silos
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
search and rescue pays for search and
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
rescue although not all of the
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
cost um so we do a mixture yeah it's
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
it's a mixture okay thank you and and
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's not uncommon for a fish and
 
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
wildlife agency using a mixture like
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
that is is the way you can get more done
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
because it's very often some some units
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
will bring in a lot more money and then
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
you can and there's a cross-pollination
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
anyway and I'll be honest with you I'm
 
00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
trying to break down the siles within my
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
agency I want us all working together um
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
but there's cross-pollination you know
 
00:51:58.829 --> 00:51:58.839 align:start position:0%
protecting habitat well that habitat is
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
good for ulet it's good for game birds
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
it's good you know it's also good for uh
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
bird watchers right that kind of thing
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
so so the 16 dedicated funds you
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
referred to you raise fees as necessary
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
so to maintain the self-funding status
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
how does that part of it work it depends
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
upon the statute that created that
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund such as wildlife habitat
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
and Fisheries habitat that that's the $1
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
on the Fisheries on the fish license
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat is paid annually by
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
anybody who purchases any type of
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
hunting license that's $22.50 CS public
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
boat access program that's the $5 per
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
boat registration is um transferred to
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
us from the Department of Safety based
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
on the number of boats that are
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
registered the non-game program is
 
00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
funded mainly by donations although
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
there is a very large fed when I talk
 
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
about dedicated accounts some of them
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
have Federal funds within those
 
00:52:59.230 --> 00:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated accounts as well but there are
 
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely no fish and game funds within
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
those dedicated accounts fish uh
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
pheasant is a prime example the only
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
funds going into the Pheasant account is
 
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
from the sale of that Pheasant permit
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
and the only expense that comes out of
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
that Pheasant account is to purchase
 
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.309 align:start position:0%
that Pheasant account is to purchase
those

00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
birds okay so you mentioned that there
 
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
were 16 that it sounded like you said
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
were self-funding that correct okay so
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
those 16 in
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
particular how does it happen that they
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
all wind up being naturally self-funding
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
do you do you occasionally increase the
 
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
fees to make them such or somehow we
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
have we have increased the Pheasant fee
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
to make it um
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
self-funding just in the statute they
 
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.910 align:start position:0%
self-funding just in the statute they
are

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
self-funded um and again there can be a
 
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
mixture of Revenue like the wildlife
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
habitat account there's a significant
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
amount of federal funds in there when
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
we're making say a million doll land
 
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
purchase 75% of that could come from
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
$750,000 when you say that in the
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
statute that makes it self funding can
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
you clarify what you mean by that the
 
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
language in the statute is all the
 
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much all the same for self-funded
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh accounts they are continually
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated non-aps right they do not
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
lapse as of June 30th any balance in
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
that fund goes forward and after years
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
of being Frugal you can have a nice
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
balance in that account and it es and
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
flows with expenditures and projects
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
right okay and so can you provide us
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
with a list of all the funds current
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
balances and growth over time okay
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you did represent
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%

celebrate no apologies needed but thank
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
you very much fish game is also very
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
thankful that director simic is here to

lead us I am looking forward to U you
 
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
know a lot of success for the Department
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
with you know the leadership team so I
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that one of the
 
00:55:52.109 --> 00:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
discussions we had was along the lines
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
that chairman Earth was bringing up
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
about the fees that may need to be
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
updated and we spoke about the fact that
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
some you may have the statutory
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
authority to do so some you may not I
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
think one of the recommendations was
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
along the lines of uh you know maybe
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
legislation to give you a bit more
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
authority to raise the fees as needed
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
given that whether there is a bill or
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
not I'm sure we can find a way to um
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
help maybe in hb2 if
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
needed would you please include in your
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
presentation a list of fees that you
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
currently may not have the authority to
 
00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:30.039 align:start position:0%
increase by yourselves that you feel
 
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
that Authority would be helpful and also
 
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:35.039 align:start position:0%
if you do that maybe a projection of
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
what you would feel the appropriate fee
 
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
would be and how would that impact the
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
budget I understand that every little
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
fee may just be a little amount compared
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
to the overall budget but we do need to
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
have a very systemic look at every
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
little thing and make sure that
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
everything is in Balance right
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
that I I don't want to get overly long
 
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
on this but but do you see what I'm
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
asking for here is that something that
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
could be provided when we meet again yes
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
comments any
 
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
other I I would just like to add that
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
our dedicated account in the fishing
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
game Fund in itself is a dedicated
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
account they're mostly in pretty good
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
shape I mean some of them certainly
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
could benefit from a fee
 
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.230 align:start position:0%
could benefit from a fee
increase

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
our issue is the unrestricted fishing
 
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
game fund that is where we need
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
help we do not have enough funding in
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted fishing game fund to
 
00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:51.640 align:start position:0%
cover the
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures coming out of that fund and
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
the majority of those expenditures are
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
your support areas in the department
 
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
like the business office the director's
 
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.549 align:start position:0%
like the business office the director's
office

00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
HR that we don't have federal funds to
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
draw down on we don't have dedicated
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
accounts also explain the difference
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
between the dedicated accounts that you
 
00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:17.559 align:start position:0%
have and what you refer to as the
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
unrestricted fishing game fund so what
 
00:58:21.549 --> 00:58:21.559 align:start position:0%
distinguishes the unrestricted fishing
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
game fund unrestricted funds are
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
different than restricted funds FS
 
00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
restricted funds absolutely are
 
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds federal funds and
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
they're all earmarked for specific
 
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
projects and programs unrestricted
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
fishing game funds can be used for all
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
other department operations well I
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
understand the word unrestricted I guess
 
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
the really the question is so your
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
restricted ones you've explained to us
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
where the funding is coming from where's
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
the funding coming from in the UND
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
districted ones are there not fees
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
associated with that one as well or that
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely would be part of
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
the presentation that we did for house
 
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
ways and means we actually have 13
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
individual pots of money that that make
 
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
up the unrestricted fishing game fund
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
all licenses being the biggest part um
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
so all of these little interest earnings
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
on our savings indirect cost recoveries
 
00:59:23.069 --> 00:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
on federal grants so essentially what
 
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is the big one
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
there is licenses in terms of things
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
control and you don't really want to
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
raise those because of the cost of of
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
the licenses in surrounding states so so
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
that's the fundamental problem with that
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
one every time you raise license fees
 
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
you drop volume yeah well that makes
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
sense you know the the volume
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
drops and since we're already very high
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
compared to our surrounding states it
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
just does not make sense at this time to
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
fees why is it that
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
or maybe we should be changing
 
01:00:02.109 --> 01:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
things why is it that the the one
 
01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
license that funds that one is strictly
 
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
the hunting license why couldn't some of
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
the other license the other fees
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
also pay play into the unrestricted
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
Fund in other words the one the one
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
license that you don't want to change is
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
the the the price hunting or fishing and
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
there's there's a long list of we have
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
over a hundred different license types
 
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
in the unrestricted fund
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
yes many all of your Marine licenses
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
what about raising the some of those
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
other ones then or is it the same
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
problem you honestly I need to I've been
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
looking at our rates for all of our
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
license types compared to other states
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
um there may be a few that we can you
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
know raise and and as representative
 
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
said you know few dollars here a few
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
dollars there it adds up um but overall
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
I think most of our pricing is either
 
01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:02.039 align:start position:0%
above or right at the the average and we
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
would probably lose um numbers license
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
holders so I'm trying to go beyond that
 
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
yeah you it sounded like when you when
 
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
you rattled off what comes out of the
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
unrestricted fund it was more than just
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
supporting the fishermen or the hunters
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
or that sort of thing you talked about
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
overhead and so on and so forth right
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
and these other dedicated funds that you
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
have it sounds like that's not they're
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
not expected to support those overhead
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
expenses of the department why wouldn't
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
you consider raising some of those fees
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
as well and having them also contribute
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
to the overhead uh costs of the
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
department does that make sense what I'm
 
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
asking so those dedicated funds do yeah
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
support the overhead in the
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
department every year I process What's
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
called the internal administrative
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
charge on the majority of our dedicated
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
accounts those that you can take that
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
charge statutorily like the Pheasant
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
account cannot because it strictly says
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the statute it can only be used for
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
the purchase or propagation of
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
pheasants so I back charge those
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
accounts and those funds are deposited
 
01:02:14.829 --> 01:02:14.839 align:start position:0%
into the unrestricted fishing game fund
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
so they do pay for a portion of the
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
Department all right let me pushing this
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
a little harder
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
so how many accounts are there like the
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
Pheasant account that perhaps we should
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
be increasing pheasant fees and or at
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
least letting them go towards the
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
overhead as well and words it sounds
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
like there's those accounts some of
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
those have uh balances positive balances
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
they do and maybe we should be using
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
more of that funding to help support the
 
01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
One Fund that you apparently is the
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
biggest problem that that you refer to
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
again that's legislative changes there's
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
there's so that's what I want to get out
 
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
please tell me the legislative changes I
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
think what we need to do is we need to
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
look through them because there to be
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
honest with you it's a very convoluted
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
thing it's this one is legislative this
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
one is something else so we need to go
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
through them and we will bring you the
 
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
ones that are relevant for consideration
 
01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
here yes and then um I I understand
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
where you're going and I think you're
 
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
spot on and so we will bring that
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
forward to you it's again back to your
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
question it it's mixed the way we fund
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
the agency is mixed and it's convoluted
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
just not just in within the way we do
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
things but because of laws and
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
regulations that we have in in set but
 
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
this is the place that can change the
 
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
laws that's what we do here so so please
 
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
bring bring that sort of information
 
01:03:47.309 --> 01:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
forward so that we know um that's why we
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
have this thing called hb2 this this
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
Committee in particular uh can very
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
readily change the laws thank you very
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
much I you know I I'll just say thank
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
you for your grace I I know I'm coming
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
in a little naive to New Hampshire in
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
our process here so I appreciate your
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
patience with me oh yeah and this agency
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
I we're going to get them on the right
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
foot I'm G to learn I'm G to get you you
 
01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
won't see this again I'll come in here
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
next time much more prepared no just we
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
also I also don't want to get ahead of
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
the governor's office to be honest with
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
you and so I I was just like well we'll
 
01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
go there we'll see what their questions
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
are and right fair enough I I have no
 
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
problem with that I just wanted if
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's any more questions about what to
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
expect let me I I'm with you please let
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
us know because we want to do whatever
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
we can to help you now that doesn't mean
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to do everything
 
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
but we're certainly willing to work with
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
you just one moment um representative Dy
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips thank you
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't matter when I asked
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
the question um it might actually be for
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
Mickey um I'm just wondering you know
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
what is the Precedence for our you know
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
legislative body kind of like supporting
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted Revenue funds for
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
fishing game um have there been
 
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances in the past that um or
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
other parts of the department to to
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
support their operations you know what
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
is the kind of like backstory on um
 
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
their solvency I guess that's the
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
question so I can provide a history to
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
the committee of all the general fund
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
support that has been provided to
 
01:05:22.829 --> 01:05:22.839 align:start position:0%
fishing game it's going back several
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
budgets now from when the fund was
 
01:05:24.839 --> 01:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
budgets now from when the fund was
pretty

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh uh close to you know a zero balance
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's built up I think we're planning on
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
closing 24 with about a $13 million
 
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
balance so it's much healthier than it
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
used to be yes um but I can provide that
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
to the committee and just so you can see
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
the history of the general fund support
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
and how it's
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
grown and that's great but I want to go
 
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
beyond that and understand all these
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
other funds and what can be done there
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
as well in terms of increasing revenues
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
um outside of the general fund revenues
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so so the the state does publish a
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated f fund report so all these
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds are provided with some
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
narrative and some history like a 5-year
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
history going back so we can provide
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
that to the committee too with statutory
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
references and everything so that it's
 
01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
you look at a bigger picture than just
 
01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted fishing game fund right
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
thank you and and just just to note most
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
all of those with the exception of maybe
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
a couple are part of house bill one so
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
you do see all of those accounts in
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
house bill one with an agency income or
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
restricted fund or whatever uh source of
 
01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
fund rather than fishing game funds so
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
all of those will be part of the budget
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
package they were part of the agency
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
budget package too but they're just not
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
part of the unrestricted fishing game
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
fund where the department says they and
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
as you know I'm looking at a spreadsheet
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
which doesn't have those references so
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's the part of the problem if a
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
little broader inter relationship
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
between the spreadsheet and the actual
 
01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes stuff um
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
representative D thank you just to
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
follow up on the revenue streams that
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
you have I would not sell myself short
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
on try taking a look at what your
 
01:06:58.349 --> 01:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
um past experience has been in
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
increasing the licenses fees just go
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
through and do an analysis of it and see
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
if it really did go down if there
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
weren't any extenuating circumstances
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is loved and
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
people come here for a reason they don't
 
01:07:14.109 --> 01:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
go to Maine for a reason they come here
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
for a reason so I think you might
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
surprise yourself that you could bump it
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
up a buck people not going to you know
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
say anything about it they're just going
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I representative Murray I
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
think this is also probably for Mickey
 
01:07:35.269 --> 01:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
can we make a you know like to say the
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
Pheasant fund is going to have $100,000
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
more I know it won't be about $100,000
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
more than it would possibly have can we
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
make that statutory change in hb2 to say
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
excess can go or is that something that
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
really would have to go through fishing
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
game or are we um are we empowered to to
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
take that kind of a route that specific
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
a route
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
for all the dedicated funds that are set
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
up in statute that have Revenue going in
 
01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
it that's State that's from State uh
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
mandated I guess or or in law certainly
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
you could you could you could do sweeps
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
of dedicated funds or anything like that
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
you would just want to be careful for
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
the federal funds that maybe go through
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
any of these accounts and those would be
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
subject to different rules but the stuff
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
that is established in State Statute you
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
can unestablished if you wanted or
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
change represent papichi thank you Mr
 
01:08:24.759 --> 01:08:27.829 align:start position:0%
change represent papichi thank you Mr
chairman

01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
the agency has a long history of um
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
being self-funded and trying really hard
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
to uh you know match the revenues with
 
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
the um expenses and I know that times
 
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
are harder these days but I want to make
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
sure you understand that while we will
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
consider every possible solution to the
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
issues for myself I would very much like
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
to exhaust every possibility of
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
finding you helping you guys match the
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
revenues and expenses through user fees
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
and you know charging the people that
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
are using the services and the general
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
fund permanent general fund you know
 
01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:12.759 align:start position:0%
funding would be a l resort to be used
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
you know break that window in case of
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
emergency type situation
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
so we we really need you to look at
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
every possible way to you know help this
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
committee get there if at all possible
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
right I just wanted to emphasize that
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
because it's only fair that you know you
 
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
know where at least I am coming from and
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'm by myself here right
 
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
so we are looking at every possibility
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
we look in every nook and corner and
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
cranny to see what we can do and I want
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
you to be aware of it and you know help
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
us by giving us for example those uh
 
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
agency you know those uh dedicated funds
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
sure we can look at the spread but
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
you guys know the story behind it you
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
have the color that we need to make
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
those decisions you know I cannot just
 
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
look at a balance and say well this
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
seems to be available all that needs to
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
be discussed with you and understood and
 
01:10:09.149 --> 01:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
see whether that's a reasonable thing to
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
do when funding and so on so we will
 
01:10:14.189 --> 01:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
need a lot of background data to you
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
know guide us through those type of
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
decisions so again you know just making
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
sure that you know what will want to
 
01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
look at okay
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
cool representative Kelly thank you just
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
to see if I can make my question clear
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
so of the federal funds are there any
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
matching funds that are General funds or
 
01:10:37.239 --> 01:10:38.550 align:start position:0%
matching funds that are General funds or
state

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
funds that I want to be careful not to
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
cut any federal funds that might be
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
needing matching funds from the
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
state from the general
 
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
funds our general funds are specifically
 
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
focused within the law enforcement
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
division in accounting unit
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
7887 so we do not use any of the 1.3
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
million of General funds within that
 
01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
funds so other so we would not be losing
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
any federal funds okay any place else
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
that you have federal funds that okay so
 
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
that's the only place okay that's the
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh further questions comments if I may I
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
put together a report on our dedicated
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
accounts it's not something I've sent to
 
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
the LBA I actually put it together for
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
internal purposes and for our
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
commission and it goes back about 10
 
01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
years with the beginning balance
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
expenses revenues incumbrances ending
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
balance it also has a chart of that
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
fluctuation and also it starts with the
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
statute if that would be helpful for you
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
that would be awesome
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay have you seen that and and it's
 
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
electronic yes absolutely in color and
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
in color all right that would be awesome
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%

01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
time any any other questions or
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%

appreciate your support well thank you
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
for coming I hope it wasn't too
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
overwhelming I'm also new to this
 
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
position as well so I I don't in all
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
honesty I did not have a lot to do with
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
the last budget go around I kind of sat
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
in the back and director Mason and the
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
colonel were up here and um director
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
Simi wasn't sure what to expect and I
 
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't either because we've never been
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
asked to come before this committee
 
01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
prior to the governor's budget being
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
released released and so I was a little
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
nervous I thought it'll just probably be
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
a question answer thing but we will put
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
together a nice product for you well it
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
was question and answer yes it was and
 
01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
you guys did a great job for fantastic
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
hope it wasn't to overwhelming no not at
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%

papichi very just a very brief question
 
02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for

questions well testifying presenting my
 
02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
bad Force The Habit um I was looking at
 
02:38:46.429 --> 02:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
your 76 lcy audits could you just remind
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
us you know the nature of those audits
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
who are the licenses and what do you
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
generally what generally happens in an
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
audit and if that's covered later it can
 
02:38:57.070 --> 02:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
wait just fine but if it's not covered
 
02:38:59.070 --> 02:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
just a tiny bit of color on
 
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:16.389 --> 02:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
okay um the division of administration

is primarily funded through the highway
 
02:39:19.710 --> 02:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
and general funds however the
 
02:39:21.550 --> 02:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
significant portion of operations is
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
supported by the application of indirect
 
02:39:26.429 --> 02:39:26.439 align:start position:0%

Turnpike dollars also support this ad

fiscal year 14

state so this might be a good place to
 
02:43:39.550 --> 02:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
speak to the what appears to be a fairly
 
02:43:42.590 --> 02:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
large increase in general funds in this
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
department 46.6 in fy2 24 adjusted and
 
02:43:50.269 --> 02:43:50.279 align:start position:0%
then 54 if I'm not mistaken in fy20 six
 
02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:58.910 --> 02:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
right six on page four page 16 I was
 
02:44:01.230 --> 02:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the bottom the darkest blue I
 
02:44:02.630 --> 02:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
think that's General funds or is that
 
02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:04.070 align:start position:0%
think that's General funds or is that
federal

02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
funds it's General funds so looking at
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
FY 24 it's 46.6
 
02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
million actual to adjusted yes right and
 
02:44:17.150 --> 02:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
then I skip over to 27 54
 
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
million 26 is 26 what I meant to say I'm
 
02:44:24.030 --> 02:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
sorry yes director can explain the jump
 
02:44:25.550 --> 02:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
in the general funds that's what I was
 
02:44:27.309 --> 02:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
curious about yeah thank
 
02:44:29.790 --> 02:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
you are you you're looking at the actual
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
to adjusted correct yes the 24 actual
 
02:44:41.870 --> 02:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:46.750 --> 02:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted so the 26 so the actual 24 to
 
02:44:50.110 --> 02:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
26 budgeted the differ has to do with
 
02:44:51.630 --> 02:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
salary and
 
02:44:58.750 --> 02:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.309 --> 02:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
the I get there's a 10% salary increase
 
02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
is that a big part of it so it's the
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits but also um a
 
02:45:08.070 --> 02:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
reclassification of for state police as
 
02:45:10.030 --> 02:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
well on top of that can can you explain
 
02:45:11.670 --> 02:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
was and the last FIS so that would have
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
been in 24 happened in 25 did we start 2
 
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
25 so they had an internal reallocation
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
then the 12% 10 and two so that equates
 
02:45:27.830 --> 02:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
for the increase in the what was the
 
02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
internal reallocation from Trooper all
 
02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
the way up to Executive major they went
 
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
up a labor grade so there was a
 
02:45:39.030 --> 02:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
reallocation internally oh like step
 
02:45:41.590 --> 02:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
sort of correct step increases that
 
02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
correct okay so that's that's basically
 
02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
that whole P that all of that is pretty
 
02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
much step increases plus the Sal
 
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
benefits the increases yes sir okay
 
02:45:58.349 --> 02:45:58.359 align:start position:0%

this combination of federal grants and
 
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:53.160 align:start position:0%

the state additionally HSM receives

02:48:08.469 --> 02:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
response sorry to keep interrupt you so
 
02:48:10.030 --> 02:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
the grants are these the kind of thing
 
02:48:11.269 --> 02:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
the federal grants are these the kind of
 
02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
thing that you you you expect every year
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
like they're just
 
02:48:18.190 --> 02:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
broad-based grants to all the states or
 
02:48:20.550 --> 02:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
are they do you apply for them and yeah
 
02:48:22.389 --> 02:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
and some some of them are pass through
 
02:48:24.389 --> 02:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
we're like the fiduciary for them grants
 
02:48:26.269 --> 02:48:26.279 align:start position:0%
that go out to the public but yes a lot
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
of them we can we can plan for and uh
 
02:48:31.070 --> 02:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
have been in um for the past several
 
02:48:33.349 --> 02:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
bium okay and do you have details of
 
02:48:35.590 --> 02:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
those yeah everything I'm not right now
 
02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
but no we we have it all okay I am okay
 
02:48:39.030 --> 02:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
can you provide details I should have
 
02:48:41.830 --> 02:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
asked yeah and representative hen
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
phelips thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
um for answering my questions this is
 
02:48:49.630 --> 02:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
really easy one I think on 19 I'm just
 
02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
having a hard time deciphering between
 
02:48:54.990 --> 02:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
the two dark blue bar chart colors so if
 
02:48:57.870 --> 02:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
you could just clarify for me if the
 
02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
larger portion of each bar graph is
 
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
either General funding or federal
 
02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
funding so you can tell what the other
 
02:49:09.429 --> 02:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:12.349 --> 02:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
can then I think I think as director Nu
 
02:49:15.429 --> 02:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
said that the significant portion is um
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:21.229 --> 02:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
I apologize for that the dark blue you
 
02:49:23.790 --> 02:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
have your hand up okay represent Papi
 
02:49:26.550 --> 02:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
and just as a personal thing I do happen
 
02:49:28.590 --> 02:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
to be color blind so for me colors are a
 
02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
bit more of a challenge I can see the
 
02:49:33.389 --> 02:49:33.399 align:start position:0%
shad and at the end I'm a numbers guy
 
02:49:35.469 --> 02:49:35.479 align:start position:0%
but if we could contrast the colors a
 
02:49:37.190 --> 02:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
bit more that would make the job easier
 
02:49:39.630 --> 02:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
for I think not just me but definitely
 
02:49:42.790 --> 02:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
for me so no stress that's good advice
 
02:49:51.190 --> 02:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.429 --> 02:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
additionally HSM receives funding
 
02:49:56.309 --> 02:49:56.319 align:start position:0%

I don't think the rsa's actually
 
02:50:17.469 --> 02:50:17.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned here could you just repeat the

New Hampshire and question thank you
 
02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
what funds the 911
 
02:51:47.110 --> 02:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
fund the
 
02:51:51.309 --> 02:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
um the charge and I'm that shows up on
 
02:51:53.830 --> 02:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
our phone bills or what yep give me one
 
02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:55.030 align:start position:0%
our phone bills or what yep give me one
minute

02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
minute
 
02:51:56.790 --> 02:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay really it's going to take you a
 
02:52:02.990 --> 02:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:05.950 --> 02:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
there so new hampers enhanced 911 system
 
02:52:08.110 --> 02:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
is primarily funded through a dedicated
 
02:52:09.950 --> 02:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
sear charge applied to various
 
02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
communication systems the collected sear
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
charges are remitted to the state's
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
enhanced 911 system systems fund which
 
02:52:21.150 --> 02:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
is utiliz I exclusive exclusively for
 
02:52:22.750 --> 02:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
the development and operation of the
 
02:52:25.510 --> 02:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
enhanced 911 services and the Statewide
 
02:52:27.510 --> 02:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
emergency notification
 
02:52:29.950 --> 02:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
system on page so these appear on our
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
phone bills yes anywhere else you sort
 
02:52:36.030 --> 02:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
of sound like you rattle off more than
 
02:52:38.229 --> 02:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
just no that's it that's okay so we
 
02:52:39.309 --> 02:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
could actually see that on our own
 
02:52:41.550 --> 02:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
individual bills it's one separate item
 
02:52:44.389 --> 02:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
says 911 whatever okay great thank
 
02:52:47.070 --> 02:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
you yes ma'am uh
 
02:52:52.389 --> 02:52:52.399 align:start position:0%
representative Mary H you thank you um
 
02:52:56.630 --> 02:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
can you just uh iterate that I guess
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
what do other uh Communications
 
02:53:00.830 --> 02:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
organizations they don't contribute to
 
02:53:03.269 --> 02:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
the 911 except through their phone bill
 
02:53:04.750 --> 02:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
I mean is there any other charges that
 
02:53:06.269 --> 02:53:06.279 align:start position:0%
come through communication services in
 
02:53:08.469 --> 02:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
the state no I mean this like like
 
02:53:10.590 --> 02:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
director Nuri said this search charge is
 
02:53:12.429 --> 02:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
directly related to funding the
 
02:53:14.750 --> 02:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
operations of the division of emergency
 
02:53:17.389 --> 02:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
services and Communications the 911 we
 
02:53:19.229 --> 02:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
have two PS
 
02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
um one in conquered one in lonia and um
 
02:53:25.150 --> 02:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
and then we have the network the overall
 
02:53:27.630 --> 02:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
Network that rides on it so so that
 
02:53:30.429 --> 02:53:30.439 align:start position:0%
individual communities would not be
 
02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
funded through this so there would have
 
02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
to be their own funding source at that
 
02:53:37.550 --> 02:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
local Municipal level okay so I'm sorry
 
02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead no you same question yeah go
 
02:53:42.150 --> 02:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
ahead so when you say the indiv the
 
02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
individual communities fund
 
02:53:45.870 --> 02:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
themselves well I think I think the
 
02:53:48.510 --> 02:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
question was how would radio um systems
 
02:53:50.070 --> 02:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
be handled at the local level that would
 
02:53:54.030 --> 02:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
be separate not exactly um I don't know
 
02:53:55.389 --> 02:53:55.399 align:start position:0%
the names of companies but major
 
02:53:56.910 --> 02:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
communication companies that function in
 
02:54:00.349 --> 02:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
the state don't contribute to a 911 fund
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
like what's who does my
 
02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
telephone Verizon does Verizon
 
02:54:06.670 --> 02:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
contribute anything to this fund
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
themselves other than through you know a
 
02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
phone bill or any other Communication
 
02:54:11.790 --> 02:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
System it seems to me I what I'm trying
 
02:54:12.990 --> 02:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
to get at it seems to me that there are
 
02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
other entities that have an interest in
 
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
the 911 system that maybe should be
 
02:54:21.150 --> 02:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
contributing to that as well we can
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
provide an exact list to you as to who
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
was on that and who isn't just so we're
 
02:54:29.349 --> 02:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
we're certain we'll deal with you know
 
02:54:30.429 --> 02:54:30.439 align:start position:0%
that that'd be great yeah if you could
 
02:54:32.269 --> 02:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
get that to Mr Lander again that'd be
 
02:54:36.030 --> 02:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you you did that I'm good
 
02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:40.950 align:start position:0%

02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
naive question but what is the 988
 
02:55:43.389 --> 02:55:43.399 align:start position:0%
hotline it's for Behavior heal okay
 
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
right behavioral health behavioral

02:55:52.269 --> 02:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
was there another question on emergency
 
02:55:52.279 --> 02:55:59.110 align:start position:0%
was there another question on emergency

02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay page 24 moves to the division of
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
fire standards and training and EMS
 
02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:07.600 align:start position:0%

details the division's 11.2
 
02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
million budget request a question here
 
02:56:21.309 --> 02:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
of course this this is probably going to
 
02:56:23.150 --> 02:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
be a little off the
 
02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:25.389 align:start position:0%
be a little off the
charts

02:56:25.389 --> 02:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
charts
 
02:56:30.070 --> 02:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
um so we have a requirement as I
 
02:56:32.229 --> 02:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
understand it in in the fire standard
 
02:56:35.670 --> 02:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
side of things there two levels of fire
 
02:56:39.830 --> 02:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
certification fire one fire two yeah and
 
02:56:41.510 --> 02:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
the fire two is the
 
02:56:44.389 --> 02:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
more uh serious one right the harder one
 
02:56:45.950 --> 02:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
the next one they go in that order one
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
and then two yes okay so the Fire 2 the
 
02:56:50.469 --> 02:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
one we got to hike up the six steps six
 
02:56:51.990 --> 02:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
flights and all the stuff on your back
 
02:56:53.950 --> 02:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
and everything I would defer to director
 
02:56:55.469 --> 02:56:55.479 align:start position:0%
cutting because he's the I wasn't a
 
02:56:58.389 --> 02:56:58.399 align:start position:0%
firefighter but okay will he be coming

across the
 
03:00:12.269 --> 03:00:12.279 align:start position:0%
state fems and fmo are supported by
 
03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue primarily generated from fees
 
03:00:19.070 --> 03:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
associated with the provision of copies
 
03:00:21.750 --> 03:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicle records and
 
03:00:25.429 --> 03:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
certificates these records are
 
03:00:27.469 --> 03:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
requested so now you're speaking to what
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
funds the fire fund yes sir and it's
 
03:00:31.830 --> 03:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
only what you just said the say that
 
03:00:35.229 --> 03:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
again yep so it is primarily generated
 
03:00:37.389 --> 03:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
it's primarily generated revenue is
 
03:00:40.269 --> 03:00:40.279 align:start position:0%
primarily generated from fees associated
 
03:00:42.910 --> 03:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
with the provision of copies of Motor
 
03:00:45.710 --> 03:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
Vehicle records and
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
certificates records are requested by
 
03:00:51.070 --> 03:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and other authorized
 
03:00:54.550 --> 03:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
recck agents in accordance with
 
03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:56.910 align:start position:0%
recck agents in accordance with
RSA

03:00:56.910 --> 03:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
03:01:00.990 --> 03:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
14 the fees collected so so so yes so
 
03:01:08.710 --> 03:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
slow down there so um these are so when
 
03:01:10.510 --> 03:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
there's a fire I assume that's when
 
03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are trying to get
 
03:01:16.750 --> 03:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
records no no it actually um so it's
 
03:01:21.389 --> 03:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
when um and it's when companies are
 
03:01:21.399 --> 03:01:22.910 align:start position:0%
when um and it's when companies are
requesting

03:01:22.910 --> 03:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
03:01:22.920 --> 03:01:24.670 align:start position:0%
requesting
from

03:01:24.670 --> 03:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:01:29.870 --> 03:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
the dnv a record on um they they're
 
03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
trying to sell somebody um an insurance
 
03:01:34.590 --> 03:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
policy and they're looking for their
 
03:01:37.229 --> 03:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle history it could be
 
03:01:38.349 --> 03:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
something like
 
03:01:41.150 --> 03:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
that okay so these are records requests
 
03:01:44.990 --> 03:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
of DMV and only DMV or other DMV DMV
 
03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:46.229 align:start position:0%
of DMV and only DMV or other DMV DMV
only

03:01:46.229 --> 03:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:01:49.990 --> 03:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
DMV so you have or so corporate
 
03:01:51.910 --> 03:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
interests have the ability to make these
 
03:01:55.269 --> 03:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
requests with DMV through statute yeah
 
03:01:56.830 --> 03:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
through statute yeah yeah yeah no I just
 
03:01:58.670 --> 03:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
understand so here's a question for you
 
03:02:01.510 --> 03:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
related to DMV and Records
 
03:02:04.830 --> 03:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
requests the judicial branch do they
 
03:02:09.469 --> 03:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
records what type of Records like is it
 
03:02:15.710 --> 03:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
through a court case or uh say birth
 
03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:17.990 align:start position:0%
through a court case or uh say birth
dates

03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
dates
 
03:02:21.190 --> 03:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
in particular I mean give I'm I'm not
 
03:02:23.309 --> 03:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
quite sure I'm falling
 
03:02:28.030 --> 03:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
so so if there's a criminal case yep
 
03:02:29.790 --> 03:02:29.800 align:start position:0%
there'd be provided Discovery but when
 
03:02:32.590 --> 03:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
you say the judicial branch when you
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
speak to the court I'm not quite sure
 
03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay so um a a judge has issued a bench
 
03:02:41.150 --> 03:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
warrant for somebody's arrest and one of
 
03:02:42.469 --> 03:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
the things that's required for that
 
03:02:45.190 --> 03:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
bench warrant is for the sheriff to then
 
03:02:47.389 --> 03:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
actually go out and and and serve the
 
03:02:50.790 --> 03:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
the warrant is a birth date does the and
 
03:02:52.510 --> 03:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
all those go through yeah all goes
 
03:02:54.510 --> 03:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
through the criminal justice system so
 
03:02:56.190 --> 03:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
birth dates would be on warrants which
 
03:02:58.950 --> 03:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
are all approved and so it should be a
 
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
no-brainer for the judicial department
 
03:03:02.389 --> 03:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
or the sheriff's department to get that
 
03:03:03.870 --> 03:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
information and that's all because it's
 
03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
coming through law enforcement so that's
 
03:03:07.590 --> 03:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
all through law enforcement so if
 
03:03:10.429 --> 03:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
somebody is somebody is to get an arrest
 
03:03:12.190 --> 03:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
warrant or bench warrant there would
 
03:03:13.550 --> 03:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
have to been an investigation or
 
03:03:16.349 --> 03:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
violation of law which would ultimately
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
have worked up to that well this is a
 
03:03:21.469 --> 03:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
little bit the inverse um somebody goes
 
03:03:25.269 --> 03:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
to small claims court and files a claim
 
03:03:26.590 --> 03:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
um against a
 
03:03:30.190 --> 03:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
contractor and the contractors be
 
03:03:32.790 --> 03:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
obliged to come before the court doesn't
 
03:03:35.590 --> 03:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
come before the court and then has he's
 
03:03:36.870 --> 03:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
obliged to come before the court again
 
03:03:38.229 --> 03:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't come before the court and then
 
03:03:40.990 --> 03:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
the judge issues a bench warrant which
 
03:03:43.030 --> 03:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
goes to apparently a Sheriff from what I
 
03:03:45.269 --> 03:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
understand to process it and the sheriff
 
03:03:48.510 --> 03:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
comes back and says to the claimant
 
03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
you need to get the birth date of the
 
03:03:55.750 --> 03:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
contractor okay I would I I wouldn't
 
03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable answering that specific
 
03:03:59.870 --> 03:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
question but what I think I would do is
 
03:04:01.670 --> 03:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
we will provide the driver privacy
 
03:04:04.830 --> 03:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
section of the law through Mickey to
 
03:04:07.229 --> 03:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
understand to make sure that what a
 
03:04:09.349 --> 03:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
judge can do and what the public can do
 
03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
are different and what law enforcement
 
03:04:14.750 --> 03:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
can do so maybe if if you could give me
 
03:04:16.990 --> 03:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
in detail the exact question like the
 
03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:18.269 align:start position:0%
in detail the exact question like the
exact

03:04:18.269 --> 03:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
exact
 
03:04:21.389 --> 03:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
example and then we will look at that
 
03:04:24.070 --> 03:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative chair I as an attorney
 
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
who has dealt with some of these bench
 
03:04:27.309 --> 03:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
works in the past for folks who have
 
03:04:30.550 --> 03:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
defaulted and not shown for cause um
 
03:04:33.190 --> 03:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
hearings if you don't have the birth
 
03:04:35.070 --> 03:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
date to submit to law enforcement I
 
03:04:36.469 --> 03:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
don't I kind of think your that's where
 
03:04:38.469 --> 03:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
your case ends more or
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
less my understanding so that's what
 
03:04:42.550 --> 03:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's the question I want answered is
 
03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
why is it that a judge can issue a bench
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
warrant and the state
 
03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:49.510 align:start position:0%
warrant and the state
whatever

03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:04:53.110 --> 03:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
entity cannot process that without going
 
03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
claimant and my question is I don't know
 
03:04:59.469 --> 03:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
how a judge could would issue a bench
 
03:05:01.229 --> 03:05:01.239 align:start position:0%
warrant if they didn't have a date of
 
03:05:03.469 --> 03:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
birth right but I I that's we will we
 
03:05:04.870 --> 03:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
will I'm telling you what's happened and
 
03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
I spoke to the the head of the district
 
03:05:08.070 --> 03:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
court and she said that's exactly what
 
03:05:09.670 --> 03:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
happened that's exactly what's happening
 
03:05:11.950 --> 03:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
she's looking into why the sheriff can't
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
get the birth date so that's why I'm
 
03:05:14.830 --> 03:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
asking you the question because you guys
 
03:05:16.030 --> 03:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
are the guys that provide the
 
03:05:17.710 --> 03:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
information and I will work with the
 
03:05:19.349 --> 03:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
courts and we will get you an answer
 
03:05:20.510 --> 03:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
perfect thank
 
03:05:23.950 --> 03:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
you yes ma'am I'm sorry repres represent
 
03:05:27.070 --> 03:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
Murray along the same lines um you know
 
03:05:29.229 --> 03:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
you talked about the example of someone
 
03:05:31.910 --> 03:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
applying for an insurance policy and
 
03:05:33.309 --> 03:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
they're looking to see you know how many
 
03:05:35.429 --> 03:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
crashes you've had I'm assuming first of
 
03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
all that um if I'm the one applying for
 
03:05:38.990 --> 03:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
the policy I've given them permission to
 
03:05:41.309 --> 03:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
go look at my thing which it begs the
 
03:05:43.150 --> 03:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
question it says on my ride alance which
 
03:05:44.950 --> 03:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
I try to do at least one a year with the
 
03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
people I and I know the answer to this
 
03:05:48.990 --> 03:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
and I really respect that it's a hard
 
03:05:50.550 --> 03:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
not but I always like to ask would you
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
look me up and they can't they're very
 
03:05:55.870 --> 03:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
clear that no we absolutely cannot look
 
03:05:58.110 --> 03:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
up your says it's my file I'm giving you
 
03:05:59.349 --> 03:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
permission to do that and they're like
 
03:06:00.429 --> 03:06:00.439 align:start position:0%
nope you haven't done anything wrong
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're not going to look up your file and
 
03:06:03.950 --> 03:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
it just seems strange to me that I can't
 
03:06:06.389 --> 03:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
request my own information just I'm
 
03:06:08.190 --> 03:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
curious I really I I know there's
 
03:06:09.469 --> 03:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
nothing there I haven't had a ticket
 
03:06:11.429 --> 03:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
since I was probably 32 but you can
 
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
request your own you know driving along
 
03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the car you know and when I'm in the
 
03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
ride along I was he's you know you stop
 
03:06:18.190 --> 03:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
he stop someone look up and said would
 
03:06:19.870 --> 03:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
you look me up he's like no can't do
 
03:06:21.750 --> 03:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
that he's smart telling you that because
 
03:06:23.550 --> 03:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
he would have been violating the law
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
right exactly but my guess my point is
 
03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
that um I can give permission to a
 
03:06:29.950 --> 03:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
corporate entity which you know fine if
 
03:06:31.309 --> 03:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
I want the insurance that they can look
 
03:06:33.870 --> 03:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
it up but it's always amused me that it
 
03:06:35.830 --> 03:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
is such a hard no when I ask the police
 
03:06:37.389 --> 03:06:37.399 align:start position:0%
officer sitting next to me would you
 
03:06:39.070 --> 03:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
mind looking up my record and they're
 
03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
like they will not cross that line and I
 
03:06:42.830 --> 03:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
respect them for doing that but we will
 
03:06:44.830 --> 03:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
forward the driver privacy statute
 
03:06:48.150 --> 03:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
because it it is um is just curious to
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
me because it's my data but thank you
 
03:06:52.110 --> 03:06:52.120 align:start position:0%

03:06:53.790 --> 03:06:53.800 align:start position:0%

03:09:46.670 --> 03:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
you don't need to answer this right now
 
03:09:49.590 --> 03:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
but hope provide the information um is a
 
03:09:52.550 --> 03:09:52.560 align:start position:0%

03:10:05.150 --> 03:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you other people yes
 
03:10:07.790 --> 03:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
represent D Roy I know that the safety
 
03:10:10.190 --> 03:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
department has had a very difficult time
 
03:10:12.030 --> 03:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
Oh I thought you would tell me to some
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
um hiring people you slated a bunch of
 
03:10:17.790 --> 03:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
positions over the year right and you
 
03:10:20.630 --> 03:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
w't aable to fill those positions those
 
03:10:23.790 --> 03:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
funds are those non-aps funds and they
 
03:10:25.990 --> 03:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
move over into the next budget or do you
 
03:10:28.030 --> 03:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
just kind of that goes in there and then
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
we raise the budget again okay I'll let
 
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
Amy that's what you're talking about is
 
03:10:36.030 --> 03:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
mainly the class 10 funds which we have
 
03:10:38.510 --> 03:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
from the vacancies from the vacancies
 
03:10:40.670 --> 03:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you there vacancies is those funds
 
03:10:44.790 --> 03:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
do sweep in the bium they sweep okay
 
03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
thank you to clarify that that means it
 
03:10:49.510 --> 03:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
will lapse back to either the general
 
03:10:51.030 --> 03:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
fund or the highway Fund in the case of
 
03:10:53.389 --> 03:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
Highway funded positions back to those
 
03:10:55.469 --> 03:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
undesignated Surplus balances they don't
 
03:10:57.030 --> 03:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
stay with the Department they're not
 
03:10:57.040 --> 03:10:58.150 align:start position:0%
stay with the Department they're not
rolling

03:10:58.150 --> 03:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
rolling
 
03:11:00.670 --> 03:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
forward yes sir representative
 
03:11:03.309 --> 03:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
Bean thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is not related
 
03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
to the budget um it's to do with the uh
 
03:11:09.840 --> 03:11:11.030 align:start position:0%
to the budget um it's to do with the uh
background

03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
background
 
03:11:14.190 --> 03:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
checks I've got a problem with a
 
03:11:16.590 --> 03:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
department in bellnap county that uh
 
03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
they they're telling me that it takes
 
03:11:20.349 --> 03:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
eight weeks to get a background check I
 
03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
want to know how long it takes from the
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
time you receive the background check to
 
03:11:25.750 --> 03:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
the time you get it back to the
 
03:11:29.150 --> 03:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
department So currently the numbers and
 
03:11:31.750 --> 03:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
I checked today before I came over we
 
03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
are we are zero but it's important
 
03:11:37.349 --> 03:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
because we we fed a lot of phone calls
 
03:11:41.349 --> 03:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
on this but today we are zero to five
 
03:11:45.790 --> 03:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
days turnaround on your record check
 
03:11:50.269 --> 03:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
with zero backlog there is no backlog
 
03:11:53.070 --> 03:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
and that's been consistent for 18 months
 
03:11:57.150 --> 03:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
now I think sir I think and and and it's
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
easy to have some confusion because you
 
03:12:02.429 --> 03:12:02.439 align:start position:0%
use the term background so we at the
 
03:12:04.429 --> 03:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
department of safety do not do a
 
03:12:07.830 --> 03:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
background check we provide a record so
 
03:12:10.349 --> 03:12:10.359 align:start position:0%
we either provide the state record the
 
03:12:13.110 --> 03:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
state criminal history or we provide the
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
FBI fingerprint-based record if there is
 
03:12:20.429 --> 03:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
a record convictions so when an employer
 
03:12:24.389 --> 03:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
or an agency requests that the state
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
record can be done on our portal so it
 
03:12:29.349 --> 03:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
you can put in the submission you can
 
03:12:31.510 --> 03:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
pay and you can get that back
 
03:12:34.110 --> 03:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
electronically and that's you can get
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
that within a day fairly
 
03:12:41.870 --> 03:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
quickly follow up just just go on so are
 
03:12:43.750 --> 03:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
there any other records that are needed
 
03:12:45.550 --> 03:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
this is for the nursing home so I what I
 
03:12:46.710 --> 03:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
would say is this what I would Point
 
03:12:49.710 --> 03:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
them to is first of all have them call
 
03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
the criminal records Bureau today but
 
03:12:54.990 --> 03:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
they may have been provided their record
 
03:12:57.389 --> 03:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
and then I can't speak to any further
 
03:12:58.950 --> 03:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
checks that need to be done on the
 
03:13:02.030 --> 03:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
employer side but when they need the
 
03:13:04.830 --> 03:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
record from us we can turn that around
 
03:13:07.710 --> 03:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
very quickly and we have but again it's
 
03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
complicated So when you say background
 
03:13:12.389 --> 03:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
maybe they have a record and they still
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
need to do more work or there's more
 
03:13:16.269 --> 03:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
checks or you know there's unique um
 
03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
layers add additional layers before the
 
03:13:20.870 --> 03:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
person's hired what we've done in the
 
03:13:23.710 --> 03:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
past what we've experienced is sometimes
 
03:13:26.510 --> 03:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
agencies go to a third party vendor to
 
03:13:29.110 --> 03:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
get the background check and and and
 
03:13:30.710 --> 03:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes and they have gone to like
 
03:13:32.590 --> 03:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
various courts to see if there are
 
03:13:34.830 --> 03:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
records which takes time but the state
 
03:13:36.990 --> 03:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
criminal record if there are convictions
 
03:13:40.590 --> 03:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
is done is instantly and our um
 
03:13:42.150 --> 03:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
Christine Shay who runs the criminal
 
03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
records Bureau has done a very good job
 
03:13:46.830 --> 03:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
staying on top of this being responsive
 
03:13:49.469 --> 03:13:49.479 align:start position:0%
but those numbers are accurate so if you
 
03:13:51.990 --> 03:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
have a constituent that's waiting what I
 
03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
would do is we will speak to them but I
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
would Point them back to the employer
 
03:13:59.590 --> 03:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
and say do you have my record and if you
 
03:14:02.670 --> 03:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
have my record what's what's holding
 
03:14:05.750 --> 03:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
this up my hiring well this is the
 
03:14:08.429 --> 03:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
department the the nursing department in
 
03:14:11.229 --> 03:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
belau County they told us the part of
 
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
the reason that they can't get lnas is
 
03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
because it takes eight weeks to do a
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
background check on a potential employee
 
03:14:20.349 --> 03:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
well it may take 8 weeks for someone to
 
03:14:23.229 --> 03:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
do a background check but you're getting
 
03:14:27.229 --> 03:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
that state record within I would say
 
03:14:30.229 --> 03:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
close to a day and the FBI record once
 
03:14:32.710 --> 03:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
we get the prints that's coming back in
 
03:14:36.030 --> 03:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
five days so zero to five days and you
 
03:14:38.190 --> 03:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
can get in today to get an appointment
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
so if you need to get in to get an
 
03:14:42.190 --> 03:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
appointment on one of our live scan
 
03:14:44.229 --> 03:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
machines the apist machines you can get
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
in so I checked today before testifying
 
03:14:50.469 --> 03:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
0 to 5 days turnaround no backlog and
 
03:14:53.229 --> 03:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
it's been like that for 18 months thank
 
03:14:54.269 --> 03:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
you very much I think there's some
 
03:14:56.950 --> 03:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
confusion Sir with it and and we will we
 
03:14:59.710 --> 03:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
will work with them so have them call us
 
03:15:01.590 --> 03:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
and we can we can get that done by the
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
end of the day there may or may not be
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
any confusion okay but that's that's
 
03:15:08.750 --> 03:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
accurate coming from them and they do a
 
03:15:11.190 --> 03:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
good job and and just to highlight too
 
03:15:13.710 --> 03:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
I'm also involved in a in a a task force
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's worked on this multi-agency task
 
03:15:19.070 --> 03:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
force through statute but in the group
 
03:15:20.309 --> 03:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
we have the Commissioner of Health and
 
03:15:22.510 --> 03:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh Department of
 
03:15:24.830 --> 03:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
Education Department of Revenue Office
 
03:15:27.670 --> 03:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
of professional lure Lottery Commission
 
03:15:29.469 --> 03:15:29.479 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with some external
 
03:15:32.550 --> 03:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders uh School administrators uh
 
03:15:35.349 --> 03:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
the association of counties the banking
 
03:15:40.030 --> 03:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
department and one
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
more the municipal Association to look
 
03:15:45.710 --> 03:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
we've met once already is there anything
 
03:15:48.070 --> 03:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
we can do internally is there anything
 
03:15:49.750 --> 03:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
that can be done to speed this process
 
03:15:53.070 --> 03:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
up but I think we are we are as tight as
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
we can be if you come on one of our
 
03:15:57.150 --> 03:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
portals one of our portals that connects
 
03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the state system so it sounds like
 
03:16:02.189 --> 03:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
he's heard this problem
 
03:16:05.110 --> 03:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
before but they're blaming it on you
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
obviously but honestly sir a customer
 
03:16:08.429 --> 03:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
service have them call them we'll talk
 
03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
to them we'll we'll we'll figure it out
 
03:16:12.670 --> 03:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
and we'll help yeah perfect thank you
 
03:16:15.309 --> 03:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
very much representative hacken Phillips
 
03:16:17.189 --> 03:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I just thank you Mr chair I just
 
03:16:19.550 --> 03:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
wonder if it's possibly like a some sort
 
03:16:22.469 --> 03:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
of DHHS CMS
 
03:16:26.349 --> 03:16:26.359 align:start position:0%
type Health Care protocol that's not
 
03:16:28.469 --> 03:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
part of that equation but may also be
 
03:16:30.630 --> 03:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
included in this check for folks who are
 
03:16:33.469 --> 03:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
trying to work in the nursing home so um
 
03:16:36.550 --> 03:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:38.870 --> 03:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
guess represent
 
03:16:43.269 --> 03:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
D in terms of Revenue um for the police
 
03:16:45.469 --> 03:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
department or for the Troopers we
 
03:16:47.070 --> 03:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
haven't had a lot so we haven't seen a
 
03:16:49.389 --> 03:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
lot on the highways a lot of speeding is
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
happening and you know that so my my
 
03:16:53.309 --> 03:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
assumption is that we're not getting the
 
03:16:55.429 --> 03:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
revenue that we need because people
 
03:16:57.469 --> 03:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
aren't being stopped or being fined for
 
03:17:00.110 --> 03:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
going 80 or 90 miles an hour down the
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
turnpike and Spalding being one of them
 
03:17:04.830 --> 03:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
I would love to
 
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
see a
 
03:17:09.670 --> 03:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
chart for the last say three or four
 
03:17:13.309 --> 03:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
years on what revenue is being generated
 
03:17:17.550 --> 03:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
by the Troopers for uh people who are
 
03:17:19.429 --> 03:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
you know violating the
 
03:17:22.070 --> 03:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
law sure no we can provide that it would
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
be interesting to see this is what
 
03:17:24.950 --> 03:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
happens because people are talking about
 
03:17:26.550 --> 03:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
this now people are very concerned about
 
03:17:28.590 --> 03:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's nobody on the
 
03:17:30.990 --> 03:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
turnpike stopping people from going fast
 
03:17:34.189 --> 03:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
but that revenue is a deterrent right I
 
03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
mean nobody wants to get a $500 fine but
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
if we're not doing if we're not
 
03:17:39.630 --> 03:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
performing that service we're not
 
03:17:41.550 --> 03:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
getting the revenue to you know actually
 
03:17:43.269 --> 03:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
support other departments here that we
 
03:17:45.670 --> 03:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
need um so there's kind of it's like a
 
03:17:48.229 --> 03:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
two so no thank you for bringing that up
 
03:17:50.429 --> 03:17:50.439 align:start position:0%
and and and director nuber can get the
 
03:17:52.710 --> 03:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
stats on you know the history but I I
 
03:17:54.309 --> 03:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
will say this and I I think it's
 
03:17:57.070 --> 03:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
important well we acknowledge that there
 
03:17:58.830 --> 03:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
are vacancies within the division of
 
03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
State Police I want to be clear that we
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
have seen tremendous interest the
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
recruitment unit is doing a great job we
 
03:18:10.030 --> 03:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
are seeing good candidates the colonel
 
03:18:11.710 --> 03:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
of the State Police the recruitment of
 
03:18:14.309 --> 03:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
training the leadership is working well
 
03:18:17.389 --> 03:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
consist consistently through this um
 
03:18:19.990 --> 03:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
I would say um you know lull and hiring
 
03:18:23.710 --> 03:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
but we are on the the uptick um it looks
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
very good promising when it comes to
 
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
activity they recognize as well as
 
03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
anyone the excessive speeds we've seen
 
03:18:34.950 --> 03:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
some terrible crashes but I can tell you
 
03:18:38.429 --> 03:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
that their activity is is extremely high
 
03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
they are working very hard out there so
 
03:18:42.429 --> 03:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
I've been working closely and I'm very
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
proud of what they're doing so it may
 
03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
seem like we're you're not seeing as
 
03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
many but they have a strategy so they're
 
03:18:51.510 --> 03:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
out there with the special enforcement
 
03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
unit they're working with the aircraft
 
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
so they're seeing what you're seeing and
 
03:18:57.429 --> 03:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
um and I believe they're doing a very
 
03:18:59.550 --> 03:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
good job and as we continue to add to
 
03:19:01.469 --> 03:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
the ranks of the State Police which we
 
03:19:04.030 --> 03:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
will we will you will continue to see
 
03:19:05.830 --> 03:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
more and will drive this number down but
 
03:19:07.870 --> 03:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
there's there's been no quitting them
 
03:19:10.309 --> 03:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
and they're working harder today than
 
03:19:11.469 --> 03:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
they ever
 
03:19:14.910 --> 03:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
work so repres
 
03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
Papi thank you and uh seriously thank
 
03:19:19.309 --> 03:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
you for providing some background on
 
03:19:21.189 --> 03:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to add that as far as
 
03:19:21.199 --> 03:19:22.389 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to add that as far as
I'm

03:19:22.389 --> 03:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:19:24.750 --> 03:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
concerned your enforcement is about
 
03:19:27.710 --> 03:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
safety I don't necessarily look at the
 
03:19:29.469 --> 03:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
Troopers as a source of Revenue the
 
03:19:31.750 --> 03:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
revenue they get is incidental I'm
 
03:19:33.670 --> 03:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
generally very concerned about pushing
 
03:19:35.189 --> 03:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
you guys for more Revenue because it
 
03:19:37.189 --> 03:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
tends to lead to more aggressive
 
03:19:38.750 --> 03:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
ticketing that may not be in the best
 
03:19:40.229 --> 03:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
interest of Public Safety if done
 
03:19:42.870 --> 03:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
incorrectly for the sake of Revenue so I
 
03:19:44.429 --> 03:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that I recognize you
 
03:19:46.189 --> 03:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
have a very complex job and I think you
 
03:19:48.110 --> 03:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
guys are doing a great job of balancing
 
03:19:50.189 --> 03:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
all these different priorities and I
 
03:19:52.189 --> 03:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
would urge you to have a very strong
 
03:19:54.150 --> 03:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
focus on the public safety which based
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
on what you are saying you guys are
 
03:19:57.269 --> 03:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
already doing and I appreciate it and I
 
03:19:59.469 --> 03:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
would like to continue doing that I
 
03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and their mission is
 
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
safety and they're not focused on the
 
03:20:05.790 --> 03:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
revenue representative Murray uh thank
 
03:20:07.630 --> 03:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I have three little
 
03:20:09.950 --> 03:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
questions which you can probably weave
 
03:20:12.750 --> 03:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
into one narrative um you know on page
 
03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
four you can see the drop in federal
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
funds um which you put to use can you
 
03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
speak to what those funds were used for
 
03:20:21.550 --> 03:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
and what the loss of that Federal
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
funding will mean going forward um and
 
03:20:28.510 --> 03:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
in the same instance um what the uh
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
freeze or the pause on you know the
 
03:20:33.189 --> 03:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
Trump's grant funding pause how that
 
03:20:34.269 --> 03:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
will affect you going forward because
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of impact with federal
 
03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
funds and the third thing is how would
 
03:20:42.229 --> 03:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
you have addressed the 4% um decrease in
 
03:20:43.670 --> 03:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
revenues that was requested by the
 
03:20:45.590 --> 03:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
governor's so does that make sense sort
 
03:20:47.189 --> 03:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
of what did you use that you know the
 
03:20:50.150 --> 03:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
the federal money for back in 2024
 
03:20:51.630 --> 03:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
what's going to be missing because that
 
03:20:55.429 --> 03:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
goes away um the pause in grant funding
 
03:20:56.910 --> 03:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
which we we have no idea where that's
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
going to go and the 4% so I'm going to
 
03:21:00.870 --> 03:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
let Amy take this but I think just so
 
03:21:05.229 --> 03:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
it's the reduction that's shown it's the
 
03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
freeze and then the additional reduction
 
03:21:10.590 --> 03:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
what's the overall impact so the overall
 
03:21:12.750 --> 03:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
impact on federal
 
03:21:16.670 --> 03:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
funds we have this bro
 
03:21:21.790 --> 03:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
so um so to start the um the reduction
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
the significant reduction is the
 
03:21:31.710 --> 03:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
co9 um so the um the next question you
 
03:21:33.469 --> 03:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
had was know within that what can you
 
03:21:35.070 --> 03:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
give a few examples of what you use that
 
03:21:36.429 --> 03:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
covid money for and what it means going
 
03:21:38.189 --> 03:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
forward not getting it um I assume some
 
03:21:39.910 --> 03:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
of this if you can speak to
 
03:21:42.429 --> 03:21:42.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um or whatever programs
 
03:21:43.990 --> 03:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
you use that for and what it means when
 
03:21:47.150 --> 03:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's gone I mean we can provide that I
 
03:21:48.670 --> 03:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
mean that's a comprehensive list but
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
that all went through you know Homeland
 
03:21:52.229 --> 03:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
Security and Emergency Management but if
 
03:21:54.870 --> 03:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
you want to look at you know what was
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
requested what was reimbursed at the
 
03:21:59.150 --> 03:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
local level the state level yeah I think
 
03:22:00.910 --> 03:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
that that would be best answered by the
 
03:22:03.229 --> 03:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
director of Homeland Security to kind of
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
give an overview of all of the
 
03:22:07.389 --> 03:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
initiatives under covid-19 and the
 
03:22:09.070 --> 03:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
funding that went out to the locals I
 
03:22:10.990 --> 03:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
think he would be best to answer that I
 
03:22:12.510 --> 03:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
can certainly get that for you but
 
03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's the significant jump there um
 
03:22:18.070 --> 03:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
reduction mhm we we'll get it that's not
 
03:22:18.080 --> 03:22:20.910 align:start position:0%
reduction mhm we we'll get it that's not
sure

03:22:20.910 --> 03:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:23.110 --> 03:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
certainly and then you asked about the
 
03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
freeze at this point we have reached out
 
03:22:27.870 --> 03:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
to all of our federal partners and are
 
03:22:30.830 --> 03:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
just at this point waiting for um
 
03:22:37.030 --> 03:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
forward and um can you did if you've had
 
03:22:41.950 --> 03:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
a chance to already um address the
 
03:22:44.110 --> 03:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
request for a 4% decrease in the budget
 
03:22:45.870 --> 03:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
where how has that affected you or have
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
you have you looked at that yet or do we
 
03:22:49.349 --> 03:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
wait for Valentine's
 
03:22:52.110 --> 03:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
Day We are continuing to work with the
 
03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
governor and her team to address that
 
03:22:54.800 --> 03:22:56.269 align:start position:0%
governor and her team to address that
thank

03:22:56.269 --> 03:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:22:59.790 --> 03:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
you just related to that I got you but
 
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
on the same point um so were you able to
 
03:23:03.790 --> 03:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
affect that in your agency budget
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
request the 4% reduction we are we have
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
and will continue to work with Governor
 
03:23:11.590 --> 03:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
a and her team and I believe that they
 
03:23:12.950 --> 03:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
understand the unique mission of the
 
03:23:15.150 --> 03:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
department and how it impacts both
 
03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and customer service no I
 
03:23:19.030 --> 03:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
I totally get that but you actually have
 
03:23:20.710 --> 03:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
already published a your agency request
 
03:23:22.870 --> 03:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious where did you get to at
 
03:23:24.590 --> 03:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
that at that point in the process
 
03:23:26.910 --> 03:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
Targets in the agency phase that's okay
 
03:23:31.070 --> 03:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:33.630 --> 03:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
um I just had a clarification on the
 
03:23:35.389 --> 03:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
arpa if I may thank you Mr chairman so
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the arpa funds I think that speaking
 
03:23:39.670 --> 03:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
for myself when I want to use the look
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the arpa funds I want to make sure
 
03:23:43.189 --> 03:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
that they were used as they were
 
03:23:45.229 --> 03:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
intended as onetime use and there is
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
nothing that leads to to us having to
 
03:23:50.309 --> 03:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
now add permanent funding to something
 
03:23:52.030 --> 03:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
that we started with ARA I cannot speak
 
03:23:54.189 --> 03:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
for my colleagues but for me that would
 
03:23:55.870 --> 03:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
be my perspective when I look at those
 
03:23:57.269 --> 03:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
numbers I want to ensure that they were
 
03:23:58.950 --> 03:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
used for one-time projects as they were
 
03:24:00.150 --> 03:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
meant to
 
03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
be just clarifying I feel confident that
 
03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
our division understands what those
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
funds were and they're one-time funds
 
03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:17.710 --> 03:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
good we good so far
 
03:24:20.950 --> 03:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
oh yeah well no no go ahead I'm right
 
03:24:23.630 --> 03:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
these are more fun or maybe
 
03:24:26.670 --> 03:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
not can you uh speak to the impact of
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
cost of rescues on you because this has
 
03:24:31.070 --> 03:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
been a um a big year you you're involved
 
03:24:32.790 --> 03:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
with rescues in the White Mountains
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's mainly fishing game that's okay I
 
03:24:36.150 --> 03:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
checked with them I thought you had some
 
03:24:37.830 --> 03:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
impact with that as well uh the other
 
03:24:39.590 --> 03:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
thing where uh I know Rockingham County
 
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
you six hour guns the sheriff's
 
03:24:43.189 --> 03:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
department did uh they had a real
 
03:24:45.550 --> 03:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
problem because they jammed and 6our did
 
03:24:49.030 --> 03:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
not respond positively to that um do you
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
know where any of that stands in terms
 
03:24:53.550 --> 03:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
of your ability to get your Firearms I
 
03:24:55.990 --> 03:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
don't know who who makes a decision
 
03:24:57.950 --> 03:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
about who buys what guns from where but
 
03:24:59.349 --> 03:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
I know that Rockingham County is now
 
03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
going out of state because six hour was
 
03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
not responsive do you have any
 
03:25:04.590 --> 03:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
information I can't speak I can't speak
 
03:25:06.670 --> 03:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
to siga but the division of State Police
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
which is overseen by the colonel colonel
 
03:25:12.750 --> 03:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
Mark Hall he has a team and if we are
 
03:25:14.590 --> 03:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
going to look at new Firearms as a
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
process they have a comprehensive team
 
03:25:19.269 --> 03:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
team of experts firearms experts and
 
03:25:21.469 --> 03:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
instructors that will test and then they
 
03:25:23.189 --> 03:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
will look and they will make evaluations
 
03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
and it will go up through the chain and
 
03:25:27.750 --> 03:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
um so they'll put a lot of work into it
 
03:25:30.910 --> 03:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
but that's and just one last thing can
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
you address the big um you know concerns
 
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
I guess you know rightful concerns will
 
03:25:38.750 --> 03:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
big to do around um Interstate 95 and
 
03:25:40.590 --> 03:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
the increase the Interstate 95 and the
 
03:25:42.710 --> 03:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
inre in accidents there and I know this
 
03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
dovet tales with Transportation no thank
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question and I think
 
03:25:49.469 --> 03:25:49.479 align:start position:0%
I mean um I mean it was terrible the
 
03:25:51.110 --> 03:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
rash of crashes we had there and the
 
03:25:53.309 --> 03:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
median crossover ones in a short period
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
of time and um quite honestly when
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
people ask why you have to wait till the
 
03:26:01.590 --> 03:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
reports are in before you make any um
 
03:26:04.110 --> 03:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
comments like what caused that you know
 
03:26:06.110 --> 03:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
it could have been speed it could have
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
been it could have been a medical issue
 
03:26:11.710 --> 03:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
so but irregardless what we have done is
 
03:26:13.670 --> 03:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
we've got a process and a team in place
 
03:26:15.790 --> 03:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
and the colonel immediately worked with
 
03:26:17.870 --> 03:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
the troop commander and a special
 
03:26:19.630 --> 03:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement unit so we put really a
 
03:26:21.510 --> 03:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
concentration there on 95 in that
 
03:26:23.950 --> 03:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
Northern Area and um but it's not really
 
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
that it's all highways it's all roads so
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're looking across but um you know
 
03:26:32.590 --> 03:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
and and you know the median um the
 
03:26:35.469 --> 03:26:35.479 align:start position:0%
cables that's really do but we work
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
closely with DOT the office of Highway
 
03:26:39.389 --> 03:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
Safety so it's either an Enforcement
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
issue it's an education issue or maybe
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's an engineering issue it's Road
 
03:26:46.229 --> 03:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
design so you have to work together but
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
to really get the root cause of these
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
you have to wait till the unfortunately
 
03:26:51.670 --> 03:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
if it's a fatal till the fatal accident
 
03:26:53.870 --> 03:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
report is done then we find out so I'm
 
03:26:56.030 --> 03:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
very sensitive to comment on an
 
03:26:58.910 --> 03:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
individual crash when the reports aren't
 
03:27:01.309 --> 03:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
done but we're working hard so stepped
 
03:27:03.670 --> 03:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
up enforcement more messaging more
 
03:27:07.830 --> 03:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
education and um and hopefully we can
 
03:27:10.750 --> 03:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
see a reduction not only there but on
 
03:27:11.830 --> 03:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
all of our
 
03:27:15.630 --> 03:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
highways you yes thank you R Papi thank
 
03:27:17.950 --> 03:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr here just to come back a little
 
03:27:19.429 --> 03:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
bit to the search and rescue I know it's
 
03:27:21.429 --> 03:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
a minor concern of yours because it is
 
03:27:23.550 --> 03:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
handled mostly by fishion game but in
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
speaking with them this fall they were
 
03:27:26.670 --> 03:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
telling me that sometimes they have to
 
03:27:28.670 --> 03:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
pull resources from other agencies some
 
03:27:30.189 --> 03:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
somebody might have a chopper somebody
 
03:27:32.550 --> 03:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
may have sure whenever you cooperate
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
with them you know was there any time
 
03:27:37.710 --> 03:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
when you know it was imbalanced when you
 
03:27:40.189 --> 03:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
know you may have felt that uh they
 
03:27:41.710 --> 03:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
should compensate you for some of the
 
03:27:43.429 --> 03:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
resources or is it stuff that inter
 
03:27:45.830 --> 03:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
agencies you know gets exchange all the
 
03:27:47.870 --> 03:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
time cooperation and we are all good on
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
that one it's seamless and fishing game
 
03:27:52.389 --> 03:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
are really the experts in that and going
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
out and doing a rescue they're doing and
 
03:27:56.910 --> 03:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
if they need our CT team if they need
 
03:27:59.830 --> 03:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
additional help we help and um but
 
03:28:01.070 --> 03:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
there's never been an issue where we've
 
03:28:03.349 --> 03:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
had to bill so we you know we use
 
03:28:06.510 --> 03:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
additional resources but um you know I
 
03:28:07.870 --> 03:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I just wanted to
 
03:28:09.229 --> 03:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
understand if you guys had any concerns
 
03:28:10.830 --> 03:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
didn't really expect anybody it's better
 
03:28:13.070 --> 03:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
to ask than to assume so no I have the
 
03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
utmost respect for them what they do in
 
03:28:16.590 --> 03:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
those weather conditions they great uh
 
03:28:20.590 --> 03:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:23.990 --> 03:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
you okay back to my way early question
 
03:28:26.110 --> 03:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
about other in all these
 
03:28:28.990 --> 03:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
cases you don't need to answer this now
 
03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
but if you could tie other together in
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
each of the different accounts and I'm
 
03:28:35.469 --> 03:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
assuming these are mostly dedicated
 
03:28:38.269 --> 03:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
funds or something else Amy did a lot of
 
03:28:40.070 --> 03:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
work on this so she can briefly and then
 
03:28:41.910 --> 03:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
we could provide this but Amy knew that
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
this question might come so go Amy
 
03:28:50.189 --> 03:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
I mean I I could it's probably best that
 
03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
I provide this for you but there is a
 
03:28:55.950 --> 03:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
breakdown of all of the other categories
 
03:28:59.349 --> 03:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
and what exactly falls into all of those
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
other kind of buckets and the fees that
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
go into each of those but um and
 
03:29:09.630 --> 03:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
different agency income but um like in
 
03:29:12.110 --> 03:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
Communications um there is you know
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:27.309 --> 03:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
like let me see like that we talked
 
03:29:29.110 --> 03:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
about the telephone search charge
 
03:29:31.309 --> 03:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lift operator fee there's a
 
03:29:34.349 --> 03:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
decal Carnival equipment fee um agency
 
03:29:36.429 --> 03:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
income administration fee a crial record
 
03:29:38.990 --> 03:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
free goes in there so like it's Pro and
 
03:29:40.910 --> 03:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
then there's um the total for each
 
03:29:43.630 --> 03:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
budget year so rather than going through
 
03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
every single line and every number it's
 
03:29:47.790 --> 03:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
probably probably easi for me to just
 
03:29:50.510 --> 03:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
provide this for you great so each of
 
03:29:52.349 --> 03:29:52.359 align:start position:0%
these others May relate to different
 
03:29:55.830 --> 03:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
groups of funds yes okay and always
 
03:29:57.229 --> 03:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds or this is there
 
03:30:00.269 --> 03:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
something else that's in there
 
03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
that these dedicated they're all
 
03:30:03.910 --> 03:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated by division she's got it broke
 
03:30:06.269 --> 03:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
it it's all by division okay yep and are
 
03:30:09.030 --> 03:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
the funding sources you'll provide those
 
03:30:09.040 --> 03:30:10.150 align:start position:0%
the funding sources you'll provide those
as

03:30:10.150 --> 03:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:30:13.389 --> 03:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
well do they are they designed to cover
 
03:30:17.910 --> 03:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
the costs for which the funds are used
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
so if you they are outlined in your
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
presentation so in the um you on one of
 
03:30:43.070 --> 03:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:50.110 --> 03:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:52.630 --> 03:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's not as I'm sorry it's
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
not as clear on here as I was hoping I
 
03:30:57.630 --> 03:30:57.640 align:start position:0%
was going to be but um in in the chart
 
03:31:02.030 --> 03:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
it'll show you um exactly what division
 
03:31:04.110 --> 03:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
what it covers what it's used for and
 
03:31:06.189 --> 03:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
what it brings in in each fiscal year so
 
03:31:08.750 --> 03:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
it'll get to your questions about um
 
03:31:10.590 --> 03:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
exactly the revenue and then what what
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
it what it's used for right okay but I'm
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
also trying to understand um that's
 
03:31:16.910 --> 03:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
great I definitely want all that but
 
03:31:21.349 --> 03:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
understanding so it's is it intended to
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
address a particular
 
03:31:27.429 --> 03:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
need and if so is it funded
 
03:31:28.990 --> 03:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately by whatever sources of
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
revenue are coming into it to address
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
that need or we do we need to look at
 
03:31:36.269 --> 03:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
that for each of the different consider
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
each of the different I believe it is I
 
03:31:39.910 --> 03:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
believe there's a direct correlation to
 
03:31:39.920 --> 03:31:41.070 align:start position:0%
believe there's a direct correlation to
it

03:31:41.070 --> 03:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:31:43.229 --> 03:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
but great great but so you think in
 
03:31:45.309 --> 03:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
every case your funding is adequate in
 
03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
those every one of those dedicated
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
funds you to give the answer right now
 
03:31:51.950 --> 03:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
but well I think there's two two
 
03:31:53.469 --> 03:31:53.479 align:start position:0%
questions adequate is one thing like
 
03:31:55.510 --> 03:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
does it fully fund the operation or is
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
it like right so we could provide that
 
03:31:59.830 --> 03:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
but if it's like something going to
 
03:32:02.349 --> 03:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rider safety is it directly
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
related to the to the fee for that yes
 
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
so what okay yeah great I think when you
 
03:32:10.510 --> 03:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
look at I think when you look at this
 
03:32:12.590 --> 03:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
you'll it'll make
 
03:32:15.910 --> 03:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
sense go ahead Mr LeRon I think one
 
03:32:17.790 --> 03:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
thing the department could discuss is
 
03:32:19.469 --> 03:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
the I think the largest other funds in
 
03:32:21.150 --> 03:32:21.160 align:start position:0%
the department is the highway fund cost
 
03:32:23.389 --> 03:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
of collections if maybe the department
 
03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
could just explain how that works and
 
03:32:27.910 --> 03:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
refresher for our returning members and
 
03:32:30.110 --> 03:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
explanation for the new
 
03:32:56.550 --> 03:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:59.429 --> 03:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
DM Administration
 
03:33:03.910 --> 03:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
Road cost collections to uh DMV so all a
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
DMV and Road tool essentially
 
03:33:09.070 --> 03:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
yeah you give us one second Amy's going
 
03:33:10.630 --> 03:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
to get to the right page we're going to
 
03:33:13.590 --> 03:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
be talking about the road toll what they
 
03:33:17.070 --> 03:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
collect and how the fees we collect at
 
03:33:19.349 --> 03:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
the DMV are termed cost of collection
 
03:33:22.349 --> 03:33:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:25.189 --> 03:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
goes and they can share an update it
 
03:33:28.110 --> 03:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
sounds like the OMB did resend the uh
 
03:33:30.229 --> 03:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
memo relative to the federal fund freeze
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
so that conversation may be on not
 
03:33:35.150 --> 03:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
relevant any longer perhaps so I think
 
03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
he's just saying how much has cost a
 
03:33:38.990 --> 03:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
collection and where does it
 
03:33:42.070 --> 03:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
go my presentation is just not done yet
 
03:33:51.030 --> 03:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:54.830 --> 03:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
So within both our road toll Bureau as
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
well as at the division of motor
 
03:34:01.750 --> 03:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles um all revenue that comes into
 
03:34:05.469 --> 03:34:05.479 align:start position:0%
both um both within the Bureau of Road
 
03:34:07.990 --> 03:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
tool and which is in the division of
 
03:34:10.670 --> 03:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
administration and at the Department of
 
03:34:13.349 --> 03:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles all of that Revenue that
 
03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
comes in um is
 
03:34:22.870 --> 03:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
into the highway funds and then um the
 
03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
expenses within that um Bureau and
 
03:34:31.229 --> 03:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
division are then um taken out of all of
 
03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue that comes in and that is
 
03:34:34.670 --> 03:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
termed as Costa collections I went
 
03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
through that kind of within the um uh
 
03:34:40.950 --> 03:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
DNB um kind of part of my presentation
 
03:34:42.229 --> 03:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
and that's what's known as Costa
 
03:34:45.070 --> 03:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
collections it's what's taken off of the
 
03:34:46.990 --> 03:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
Top If if you
 
03:34:49.070 --> 03:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
will and what are the expenses that come
 
03:34:52.229 --> 03:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
out of the highway fund that would be
 
03:34:52.239 --> 03:34:53.670 align:start position:0%
out of the highway fund that would be
everything

03:34:53.670 --> 03:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
from um kind of all of the
 
03:35:01.389 --> 03:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
um expenses all of the expenses for to
 
03:35:03.950 --> 03:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
run the
 
03:35:07.469 --> 03:35:07.479 align:start position:0%
operation okay so when you're looking at
 
03:35:08.790 --> 03:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
trying to go further and cut the budget
 
03:35:11.469 --> 03:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
8% and and I'm not ask to speak to this
 
03:35:11.479 --> 03:35:13.710 align:start position:0%
8% and and I'm not ask to speak to this
but

03:35:13.710 --> 03:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:35:17.229 --> 03:35:17.239 align:start position:0%
um what I'm curious about is for these
 
03:35:18.790 --> 03:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
this highway Fund in particular I guess
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
but even all all the other ones as well
 
03:35:24.070 --> 03:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
do some of those Revenue sources perhaps
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
need to be increased rather than you're
 
03:35:30.110 --> 03:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
looking to say General funds where to
 
03:35:32.990 --> 03:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
cut your expenses you see kind of where
 
03:35:35.309 --> 03:35:35.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going with this like basically gas
 
03:35:37.229 --> 03:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
tax what we're talking about right right
 
03:35:39.790 --> 03:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think we're prepared to
 
03:35:42.269 --> 03:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
to give a recommendation on
 
03:35:43.950 --> 03:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
that that's you know give a
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation the question is are your
 
03:35:48.269 --> 03:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
costs being covered I'm not asking for
 
03:35:49.510 --> 03:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
the recommendation on what to do about
 
03:35:51.229 --> 03:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
it but are the costs being covered well
 
03:35:53.870 --> 03:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
I think the highway fund has been pretty
 
03:35:57.670 --> 03:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
um flat and the expenses are going up so
 
03:35:59.269 --> 03:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
the answer is
 
03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
no again I think my my presentation to
 
03:36:05.510 --> 03:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means is next week and you'll
 
03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
see the revenue flat the expenses going
 
03:36:11.150 --> 03:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
up in general funds has continue to um
 
03:36:14.110 --> 03:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
be put into the highway fund to uh
 
03:36:16.189 --> 03:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
supplement that okay could you forward
 
03:36:18.670 --> 03:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
us that presentation after you give it
 
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
that be great represent
 
03:36:23.950 --> 03:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
Papi thank you Mr chairman as it happens
 
03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
that was one of the uh questions you
 
03:36:27.550 --> 03:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
know I wanted to understand your
 
03:36:29.269 --> 03:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
perspective on which is that as you
 
03:36:30.950 --> 03:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned right now you appear to have a
 
03:36:33.550 --> 03:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
structural deficit in the highway fund
 
03:36:35.710 --> 03:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
which of course we can assign it to one
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
reason or another and uh I don't want to
 
03:36:39.790 --> 03:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
start that because of course you better
 
03:36:41.950 --> 03:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
understand it right now
 
03:36:45.710 --> 03:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
but you know short of General funds
 
03:36:47.950 --> 03:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
which are a very very tough ask in this
 
03:36:50.670 --> 03:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
budget cycle how do you see that being
 
03:36:52.990 --> 03:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
addressed from a policy perspective if
 
03:36:56.349 --> 03:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
the department was able to uh suggest
 
03:36:58.710 --> 03:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
how to address this and I know you got
 
03:36:59.950 --> 03:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
to be careful about telling the
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
legislature what they I that's not what
 
03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'm asking for but what are the overall
 
03:37:06.670 --> 03:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
approaches we should look at to try to
 
03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
address the structural deficit there
 
03:37:11.870 --> 03:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
without just reaching into the general
 
03:37:14.189 --> 03:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
fund and uh filling it
 
03:37:17.790 --> 03:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
up I mean this this budget that we're
 
03:37:20.990 --> 03:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
putting forward our agency budget is
 
03:37:23.870 --> 03:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't even look at that so if we
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
continue toing
 
03:37:28.870 --> 03:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
at we've met our targets where DMV we
 
03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
have it up and running it's operating um
 
03:37:33.429 --> 03:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
as Amy said cost to collections funds
 
03:37:35.309 --> 03:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
the buildings funds the employees funds
 
03:37:36.990 --> 03:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
the equipment funds of salary funds of
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
benefits same thing with road toll so
 
03:37:42.189 --> 03:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
this this has us operating and
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
continuing to operate your question is
 
03:37:46.990 --> 03:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
what could be done in the future and I
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's our position to
 
03:37:52.990 --> 03:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
answer that today thank you so you say
 
03:37:55.030 --> 03:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
today is it
 
03:37:58.670 --> 03:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
ever I mean I mean we can we we Pro we
 
03:38:01.469 --> 03:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
provide we provide the data what does it
 
03:38:03.670 --> 03:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
cost to run the Department of Motor
 
03:38:05.110 --> 03:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
Vehicles Division of Motor Vehicles what
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
does it cost to run the road toll
 
03:38:08.590 --> 03:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
there's Revenue that's brought
 
03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
in we draw down on that revenue and I
 
03:38:13.429 --> 03:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
think as Amy said what's left goes into
 
03:38:17.229 --> 03:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
the highway fund okay go ahead I
 
03:38:19.229 --> 03:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and look sometimes we ask
 
03:38:21.189 --> 03:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
questions and it's perfectly okay to say
 
03:38:24.670 --> 03:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
hey not my daily week that particular uh
 
03:38:28.070 --> 03:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
approach right um any thoughts you have
 
03:38:30.389 --> 03:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
on the uh significant amount of money
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
that you are asking for the fire fund
 
03:38:35.830 --> 03:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
top of again it's $4 million of General
 
03:38:38.070 --> 03:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
funds is a lot of money and obviously we
 
03:38:40.510 --> 03:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
want to keep the place running but you
 
03:38:43.710 --> 03:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
know what could we possibly do any
 
03:38:45.790 --> 03:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how we can avoid the need
 
03:38:49.550 --> 03:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
for such large general fund inflows yeah
 
03:38:51.030 --> 03:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
we will continue to work with the
 
03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
governor's office and her team on the
 
03:38:56.510 --> 03:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
fire fund the
 
03:38:59.710 --> 03:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
current state of it this budget and then
 
03:38:59.720 --> 03:39:00.550 align:start position:0%
current state of it this budget and then
the

03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
future thank you I'm looking forward to
 
03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
seeing what comes out of that and then
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
we'll work on the same thing thank
 
03:39:09.830 --> 03:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
you any
 
03:39:09.840 --> 03:39:11.349 align:start position:0%
you any
other

03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
questions so I want and this is a Kudos
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
if I can get to the right place are you
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
all familiar with the intersection of 89
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
and Clinton Street I am okay are you
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with a proposal that at least
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
within the last couple years was for a
 
03:39:28.189 --> 03:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
very large
 
03:39:30.429 --> 03:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
roundabout uh situation going to change
 
03:39:31.750 --> 03:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
the whole thing the whole put a big
 
03:39:33.189 --> 03:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
interchange up there are you familiar
 
03:39:35.309 --> 03:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
with that high level but not the
 
03:39:37.710 --> 03:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
specific high level high level yeah okay
 
03:39:40.030 --> 03:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
and are you familiar what's there
 
03:39:42.670 --> 03:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
now I'm thinking the last time I get off
 
03:39:45.110 --> 03:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
that exit it's a stoplight I would like
 
03:39:47.830 --> 03:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
to know what brilliant person in your
 
03:39:49.590 --> 03:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
organization finally came to the
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
realization that geez a stoplight would
 
03:39:56.110 --> 03:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
work because it's brilliant is about 5%
 
03:39:58.670 --> 03:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
of the cost if not even less and it
 
03:40:00.990 --> 03:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
works fantastically so whoever came up
 
03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
whoever finally got there I hope you're
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
given them a big award it was it wasn't
 
03:40:05.399 --> 03:40:06.349 align:start position:0%
given them a big award it was it wasn't
me

03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:40:09.550 --> 03:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
so but um but that that goes to I will I
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
will share this with you so we have a
 
03:40:13.150 --> 03:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
really good team there the state police
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
highway safety work and I know they've
 
03:40:16.510 --> 03:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
looked at a lot of of these areas but
 
03:40:19.030 --> 03:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to focus not only on
 
03:40:22.349 --> 03:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
95 from Massachusetts to Maine but
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
looking at all areas all stretches the
 
03:40:27.309 --> 03:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
roadways where is there guardrail now
 
03:40:29.950 --> 03:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
where could there be cable where and
 
03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the data we're trying
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
to build and look and determine and then
 
03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
really really where do we invest the
 
03:40:38.469 --> 03:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
money and why and we're trying to
 
03:40:40.510 --> 03:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
concentrate on Ed on the education piece
 
03:40:42.510 --> 03:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
too we've done a big push on highway
 
03:40:45.429 --> 03:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
safety we've got a new um uh vendor that
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with on messaging and um
 
03:40:49.550 --> 03:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
so we're really really looking hard on
 
03:40:51.550 --> 03:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
this for you know the safety of all of
 
03:40:53.389 --> 03:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
you everywhere so it isn't just on one
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
road but um I will send that message
 
03:40:58.429 --> 03:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
back right and it's not just looking at
 
03:41:00.910 --> 03:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
at making it improving the safety but as
 
03:41:03.750 --> 03:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
efficiently in sure the minimal cost and
 
03:41:06.349 --> 03:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
that was what I was really right like
 
03:41:10.990 --> 03:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:13.830 --> 03:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
done yes ma'am uh uh representative D
 
03:41:15.870 --> 03:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
Roy on these Road Ries that they're
 
03:41:17.309 --> 03:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
putting in and I don't know if it's more
 
03:41:20.429 --> 03:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
local if at state level but it IT
 
03:41:22.149 --> 03:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
addresses what he's talking about that
 
03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
when they're putting these rotaries in
 
03:41:24.990 --> 03:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's costing a lot of money because they
 
03:41:26.990 --> 03:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
have to buy land and they do all that
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
stuff when four lights might happen you
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
know instead of all of those rotaries
 
03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
what analysis was done to determine what
 
03:41:37.590 --> 03:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
what procedure to put in in order to do
 
03:41:39.710 --> 03:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
that I would direct that to commissioner
 
03:41:41.710 --> 03:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
Cass and his team of Engineers so
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that would do those
 
03:41:45.389 --> 03:41:45.399 align:start position:0%
studies the engineering studies we share
 
03:41:47.630 --> 03:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
whatever information we have on crashes
 
03:41:50.429 --> 03:41:50.439 align:start position:0%
but design engineering as it relates to
 
03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
safety that's uh the department of
 
03:41:54.309 --> 03:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
transportations is it okay all right
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you wheelhouse R papichi thank you
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman while while we are into the
 
03:42:02.630 --> 03:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know grab bag portion of this where
 
03:42:05.070 --> 03:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
we come up with a small questions that
 
03:42:06.750 --> 03:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
were not worth of interrupting the
 
03:42:09.070 --> 03:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
presentation until now would you be so
 
03:42:11.229 --> 03:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
kind and give director John marasco a
 
03:42:13.429 --> 03:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
heads up that we had a conversation a
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago over a
 
03:42:19.790 --> 03:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
concern I had over an inspection by done
 
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
by a government inspection station and
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
whether they are subject to the same
 
03:42:26.550 --> 03:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
safety standards and expectations as
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
private inspection stations could you
 
03:42:30.429 --> 03:42:30.439 align:start position:0%
just remind him that we did have that
 
03:42:32.070 --> 03:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
conversation and it would be great if he
 
03:42:34.269 --> 03:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
could give us an update when uh he comes
 
03:42:36.830 --> 03:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
up it's not directly a budget matter but
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
it does have to do with the operation of
 
03:42:41.429 --> 03:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
the DMV and uh you know having the same
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
standards for private and public
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
inspection stations yeah so I just
 
03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
wanted it's not a question as much as a
 
03:42:50.670 --> 03:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
no I understand but it's a so you're
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
saying there's a government inspection
 
03:42:54.110 --> 03:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
station I'm saying that there was a
 
03:42:56.030 --> 03:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
government inspection station if you
 
03:42:58.790 --> 03:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
want a bit more detail that um put a
 
03:43:01.710 --> 03:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
certificate of inspection sticker or a
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle where the uh frame the floor of
 
03:43:07.149 --> 03:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
the thing was rusted through and I
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
raised the concern with the director and
 
03:43:12.269 --> 03:43:12.279 align:start position:0%
they had an investigation and I told him
 
03:43:13.710 --> 03:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
that you know once that is over I'm not
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
going to follow up with him immediately
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
I'll just follow up and we see each
 
03:43:19.070 --> 03:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
other again to save him the time of uh
 
03:43:21.149 --> 03:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
you know I know he's got a busy schedule
 
03:43:23.229 --> 03:43:23.239 align:start position:0%
and everything and my concern again is
 
03:43:24.990 --> 03:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
that I want to make sure that the
 
03:43:27.750 --> 03:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
inspection station that issued that
 
03:43:30.030 --> 03:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
sticker in my opinion but I'm not the
 
03:43:32.349 --> 03:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
expert and I trust the DMV
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
experts was a bit um easier uh you know
 
03:43:39.510 --> 03:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
on in the inspection I'm I just want to
 
03:43:40.830 --> 03:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
make sure they're subject to the same
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
standards as Just In fairness for the
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
for the members of the um Committee just
 
03:43:48.870 --> 03:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
to um share a little is not only for
 
03:43:50.349 --> 03:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
this inspection station but any
 
03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
inspection station when we do get a
 
03:43:54.149 --> 03:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
complaint whether it's from a a motor
 
03:43:57.309 --> 03:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle stop or or an accident in a
 
03:43:59.670 --> 03:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
trooper we have automotive equipment
 
03:44:02.269 --> 03:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
inspectors that work through the state
 
03:44:05.149 --> 03:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
police we have our Troop G uh Troopers
 
03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
that are highly trained in this they do
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
investigations they will look at the
 
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle determine what um where it
 
03:44:14.110 --> 03:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
failed to meet inspection whether it was
 
03:44:18.269 --> 03:44:18.279 align:start position:0%
rust or Tire issue or emissions and then
 
03:44:21.229 --> 03:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
if they are found um that they did
 
03:44:22.950 --> 03:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
violate it there's a process where
 
03:44:24.670 --> 03:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
there's actually a hearing that can be
 
03:44:26.469 --> 03:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
conducted at the department of safety
 
03:44:28.990 --> 03:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
and then it would come up to my office
 
03:44:30.830 --> 03:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
on whether there should be a sanction
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
whether it would be uh a suspension or
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
enhanced training but we they pay very
 
03:44:38.110 --> 03:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
close attention to this so I'll make
 
03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
sure not speaking to the individual ones
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
but um but the oversight is not just on
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
one it's on it's on on all of the um
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
inspections and the mechanics that are
 
03:44:51.429 --> 03:44:51.439 align:start position:0%

03:45:01.870 --> 03:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
improvements of the DMV I mean there

used to be blog backlogs you've gotten a
 
03:45:05.149 --> 03:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
lot more infrastructure and Technology
 
03:45:07.110 --> 03:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
around that um would you like to just
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
share your improvements with that and um
 
03:45:11.550 --> 03:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
how that people are generally pretty
 
03:45:13.229 --> 03:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
happy now going to the DMV for the most
 
03:45:15.550 --> 03:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
part sure I will and I and I
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um I give uh
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
the credit not only to uh director
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
morasco assistant commissioner Lavo has
 
03:45:23.630 --> 03:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
been working closely with him but he's
 
03:45:25.510 --> 03:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
got a great team there great team on his
 
03:45:28.389 --> 03:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
licensing his registration his title but
 
03:45:30.750 --> 03:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
it's a big operation but everything's
 
03:45:33.269 --> 03:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
geared to customer service the phone
 
03:45:35.710 --> 03:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
bank the phone cues and getting whatever
 
03:45:38.030 --> 03:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
transactions can be done electronically
 
03:45:40.670 --> 03:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
done electronically while balancing
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security so it's a big
 
03:45:45.710 --> 03:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
operation and if if we gear it to
 
03:45:48.429 --> 03:45:48.439 align:start position:0%
customer service and you're you're you
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
know you are our customers and John um
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
his motto is we work for you at the DMV
 
03:45:56.510 --> 03:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
we work for you um I think that there's
 
03:45:58.990 --> 03:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
more to do we're continuing to look at
 
03:46:01.030 --> 03:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
we have projects right now electronic
 
03:46:03.790 --> 03:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
title electronic lean he works with his
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
stakeholders mainly the public but we
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
work closely with the auto dealers on
 
03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
transactions and titles and cues and
 
03:46:13.790 --> 03:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
waiting because all that equates to to
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
the economy and business and and growth
 
03:46:18.590 --> 03:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
we work closely with the uh the New
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Motor Transport trucks um are
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
they getting their registrations are
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
they getting their stamps but it's it's
 
03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
time is money and of anywhere there can
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
be an efficiency but we don't we listen
 
03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
so he brings in the stakeholders and
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
they're part of it so if we're going to
 
03:46:36.910 --> 03:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
take State dollars and build something
 
03:46:39.870 --> 03:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
build a system before we roll it out we
 
03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they're part of
 
03:46:42.269 --> 03:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
the team and they're looking and they're
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
working on it so um it's a continuous
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
process proc though to look at the
 
03:46:49.070 --> 03:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
weight times monitor it um the phones if
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
we've got I think director Nu spoke to
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
300 plus thousand minutes on the phone
 
03:46:57.429 --> 03:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
now we want to look at why so is it one
 
03:46:58.990 --> 03:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
process that's calling you know that's
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
recording is it a title issue is it how
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
do we so it's a continuous looking at
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
their um driver licensing and testing
 
03:47:07.990 --> 03:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
nothing more important than the process
 
03:47:10.510 --> 03:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
to get somebody license in their first
 
03:47:12.630 --> 03:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh driver and and director morasco sends
 
03:47:15.269 --> 03:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
a nice letter they created that I got my
 
03:47:18.309 --> 03:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
license so it's a it's a lot he has a
 
03:47:20.429 --> 03:47:20.439 align:start position:0%
lot of external stakeholders that he has
 
03:47:23.189 --> 03:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
to deal with and um so we're not making
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
you know decisions in a vacuum over
 
03:47:26.750 --> 03:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
there but he's got a good team but thank
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I'll pass
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
that along and give my best to director
 
03:47:33.950 --> 03:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative duray just have one
 
03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
last question and I know it's
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
probably uh maybe not appropriate but I
 
03:47:43.229 --> 03:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
think it's important to you are you
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
going to be taxed on extra work when now
 
03:47:50.149 --> 03:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
that they're doing um deportation of the
 
03:47:52.110 --> 03:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
immigrants here in the state is that
 
03:47:54.110 --> 03:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to put a lot of pressure on your
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
team there's been no decisions made and
 
03:47:58.990 --> 03:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
any of those decisions would go through
 
03:48:01.349 --> 03:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know the governor's office and so as
 
03:48:04.510 --> 03:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
of this point no we are working um very
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
hard at the northern border um I was
 
03:48:10.590 --> 03:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
just up there last week I can tell you
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
that uh um we've got over 150 officers
 
03:48:15.389 --> 03:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
that help
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
and they're working within those 25 air
 
03:48:19.870 --> 03:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
miles of the Border but there's a lot of
 
03:48:21.550 --> 03:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
activity in Pittsburgh there's a lot of
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
people going up there tourism
 
03:48:25.030 --> 03:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles there a lot that happens on
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
those Trails so the local Chief uh the
 
03:48:31.269 --> 03:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
county sheriff fishing game the dncr
 
03:48:32.670 --> 03:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
they're all working together we've got a
 
03:48:34.990 --> 03:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
good team up there and um and it
 
03:48:37.149 --> 03:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
enhances Public Safety I mean we really
 
03:48:39.070 --> 03:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
I've said it we have law enforcement
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
where there was little law enforcement
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
so we're continuing to do that but we
 
03:48:46.469 --> 03:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
will um we will continue to wait and see
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
um what changes take place but as of
 
03:48:51.149 --> 03:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
right now there's no there's been no it
 
03:48:52.950 --> 03:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
could be from a monetary perspective as
 
03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
well you know Manpower and monetary that
 
03:48:57.870 --> 03:48:57.880 align:start position:0%

04:01:47.070 --> 04:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
assistant the the name of the woman
 
04:01:49.710 --> 04:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
sitting beside you spell it spell the
 
04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
name last name CH h a n d o n n e t yeah
 
04:01:58.630 --> 04:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:02.429 --> 04:02:02.439 align:start position:0%
that did you did you spell it like the
 
04:02:05.349 --> 04:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
wine I I it kind of sounded that way so
 
04:02:07.670 --> 04:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
I was close yes pretty
 
04:02:11.229 --> 04:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
close uh thank you proceed so um we were
 
04:02:12.990 --> 04:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
asked uh this isn't our budget
 
04:02:14.149 --> 04:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
presentation we were asked to come and
 
04:02:15.309 --> 04:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
give kind of an overview of the
 
04:02:16.630 --> 04:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
department an introduction to the
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
department and kind of outline the
 
04:02:21.309 --> 04:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
sources of funding so that's kind of an
 
04:02:23.229 --> 04:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
introduction and that's the presentation
 
04:02:25.309 --> 04:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
that we have through here I'm going to
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
step through it oh go ahead perfect oh
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'm going to step through
 
04:02:31.790 --> 04:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
it pretty quickly it's meant as a
 
04:02:33.429 --> 04:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
resource is a probably a lot more
 
04:02:36.510 --> 04:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
information so don't go too quickly so
 
04:02:38.950 --> 04:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
we can keep up with you all right I I I
 
04:02:40.870 --> 04:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
was going to say I Pro my my goal would
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
be to just kind of touch on elements
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's more information there to take
 
04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
back and reference uh but certainly as
 
04:02:49.790 --> 04:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
we go uh please interrupt please stop
 
04:02:53.790 --> 04:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
and ask questions uh as we go so um and
 
04:02:56.229 --> 04:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
I do I I tend to go fast because I want
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
to be uh respectful of the committee's
 
04:03:02.149 --> 04:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
time but um yeah so please just
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
interrupt if there are any questions or
 
04:03:07.510 --> 04:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
flag me if I'm dragging on too long so
 
04:03:09.070 --> 04:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
you won't go too long that's that's not
 
04:03:13.870 --> 04:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
a concern um so on page one is just
 
04:03:15.550 --> 04:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
overview of the Department's Mission and
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
purpose so at nhdot we work hard every
 
04:03:21.030 --> 04:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
day to provide transportation excellence
 
04:03:22.590 --> 04:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
and enhance the quality of life for
 
04:03:24.870 --> 04:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire and our purpose
 
04:03:26.469 --> 04:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a wordy statement you
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
can read but I I look at that uh really
 
04:03:30.910 --> 04:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
we're here to provide quality
 
04:03:34.030 --> 04:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
transportation services and projects in
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
a safe efficient and timely manner so
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's our primary
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
purpose slide two is a is a kind of an
 
04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
organizational structure just to give
 
04:03:47.670 --> 04:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
you a sense of how the dot is organized
 
04:03:49.870 --> 04:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
and our budget is also reflected around
 
04:03:52.070 --> 04:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
this organization so I'm the
 
04:03:54.750 --> 04:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner underneath me there are uh
 
04:03:57.429 --> 04:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
two uh two other Commissioners assistant
 
04:03:58.990 --> 04:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner and chief engineer Dave
 
04:04:01.750 --> 04:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
rodrig who's here today and uh the
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner under the
 
04:04:04.910 --> 04:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the commissioner's
 
04:04:07.030 --> 04:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
office we have five divisions each
 
04:04:09.870 --> 04:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
division is headed by a uh
 
04:04:12.750 --> 04:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
director and uh the director and those
 
04:04:15.070 --> 04:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
five divisions are are are highlighted
 
04:04:18.910 --> 04:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
there we also have put a lot of focus
 
04:04:23.309 --> 04:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
and emphasis on on safety so we have had
 
04:04:26.149 --> 04:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
a safety office that um that we've
 
04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
elevated to be a direct report to the
 
04:04:31.750 --> 04:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office um because I feel
 
04:04:34.030 --> 04:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
safety is really a cross-cutting issue
 
04:04:35.910 --> 04:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fit under one division it
 
04:04:37.870 --> 04:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
should be cross cross divisional and
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
cross cutting and we also have an asset
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
management performance strategies um
 
04:04:46.750 --> 04:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
office that is again a direct report to
 
04:04:48.269 --> 04:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
office um the various bureaus underneath
 
04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
the divisions are are are listed there
 
04:04:55.590 --> 04:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
and then a little bit more in depth in
 
04:04:59.110 --> 04:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
the uh presentation I'll um highlight
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
some of those some of those
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
divisions so on the next slide is uh a
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
general overview of of the budgeted
 
04:05:11.070 --> 04:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
positions the positions and trends for
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
the department so the top graph show
 
04:05:14.910 --> 04:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
those are
 
04:05:17.750 --> 04:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
historical budgeted full-time positions
 
04:05:21.149 --> 04:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
going back about 20 years um and the red
 
04:05:24.269 --> 04:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
line is vehicle miles traveled it's an
 
04:05:28.389 --> 04:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
indication it's a metric of the use of
 
04:05:32.469 --> 04:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
of the system and um you can see that
 
04:05:34.149 --> 04:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
you know over time particularly in
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
around the
 
04:05:40.149 --> 04:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
2013 to 2014 budget cycle um we have had
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce reductions we have um reduced
 
04:05:47.070 --> 04:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
Personnel um it's been generally level
 
04:05:48.790 --> 04:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
since around
 
04:05:52.229 --> 04:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
2014 but we have continued to see uh
 
04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
increasing vehicle miles traveled
 
04:05:58.229 --> 04:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
y I apologize for interrupting but I I
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it if you'd remind me
 
04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
CU I'm sure you told me this two years
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
ago how do you guys measure the vehicle
 
04:06:06.309 --> 04:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
miles traveled what's the source of
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
information that you use to get to those
 
04:06:11.110 --> 04:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
numbers yep the source of uh information
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
is uh we do um we do traffic counts all
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
over the state um um there's a regular
 
04:06:22.189 --> 04:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
systematic program of of uh measuring
 
04:06:24.510 --> 04:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
traffic volumes and that's aggregated
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
and uh it's a it's a metric that we
 
04:06:28.590 --> 04:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
report to Federal Highway all 50 states
 
04:06:30.590 --> 04:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
reported the Federal Highway so it's
 
04:06:31.750 --> 04:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
based on
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
that um so the bottom line of that and
 
04:06:38.070 --> 04:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
and well well let me take a step back
 
04:06:41.469 --> 04:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
the bottom chart represents uh a a more
 
04:06:44.110 --> 04:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
near term in the last 10 years of so of
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
budgeted versus filled positions and the
 
04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
green line shows our vacancy rate um and
 
04:06:53.550 --> 04:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
we have since postco at the agency um
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
have been experiencing uh you know
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages and a um vacancy
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
rate of around 20 to
 
04:07:06.189 --> 04:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
25% um despite our best efforts we have
 
04:07:08.670 --> 04:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
continued to um have difficulties
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
filling positions and stuff my point in
 
04:07:14.550 --> 04:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
this slide is is to is as I think that
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
it indicates that we as an agency
 
04:07:20.189 --> 04:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
continue to do more with less in my mind
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's a illustration of the
 
04:07:25.389 --> 04:07:25.399 align:start position:0%
efficiency that that we uh have and that
 
04:07:27.429 --> 04:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
we Embrace we continue to get things
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
done maybe not as much as we would like
 
04:07:32.790 --> 04:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
to but even with fewer positions even
 
04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the vacancy rates we still tend to
 
04:07:37.830 --> 04:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
get our core Mission done so we continue
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
to more do more with less representative
 
04:07:42.790 --> 04:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you sorry for interrupting
 
04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
but um since we right here can you give
 
04:07:47.790 --> 04:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
a description of the workforce shortages
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
which which um positions are not being
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
filled um it's this is an aggregate for
 
04:07:56.910 --> 04:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
the for the Department as a whole we
 
04:08:00.149 --> 04:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
found primarily in in some of the
 
04:08:03.710 --> 04:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
professional development Fields so um
 
04:08:06.269 --> 04:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
two main areas that that we have chronic
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
shortages are in our engineering series
 
04:08:11.910 --> 04:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
um which more falls on the division of
 
04:08:14.590 --> 04:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
project development and our Highway
 
04:08:17.070 --> 04:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
maintainer series those are kind of some
 
04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
of the lower paid um um positions and
 
04:08:24.590 --> 04:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's exacerbated by most of those
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
positions require um um commercial
 
04:08:30.469 --> 04:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and there's a a
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
nationwide kind of shortage of CDL
 
04:08:34.990 --> 04:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
Drivers as well too so that that all
 
04:08:37.469 --> 04:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
exacerbates but in those two areas are
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
where we find the most chronic
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
shortages yeah you're welcome
 
04:08:46.109 --> 04:08:46.119 align:start position:0%
just just continuing that thought so the
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
problem persisted and got worse
 
04:08:51.269 --> 04:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
postco do is there anything you
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
attribute that to is that a national
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
problem or um we I I put it that we
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
never really recovered and never came
 
04:09:02.269 --> 04:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
back from from covid so we had a
 
04:09:06.349 --> 04:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
year plus long um hiring free at the
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
state during during Co so that was uh
 
04:09:13.710 --> 04:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
probably a precipitating uh cost but
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
then coming out of Co Workforce Dynamics
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
had changed um certainly the uh number
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
of remote uh you know people working
 
04:09:26.189 --> 04:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
remotely that that we have um that we're
 
04:09:29.349 --> 04:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
not quite as flexible with and um I
 
04:09:32.590 --> 04:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
think the competitive W wages as well
 
04:09:36.189 --> 04:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
particularly at those lower um um wage
 
04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
rates we saw a lot of inflation and
 
04:09:39.950 --> 04:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
stuff coming out of covid and coming
 
04:09:43.950 --> 04:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
back back in the State uh we did have a
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
10% um pay raise
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
in uh two years ago 2 and a half years
 
04:09:54.189 --> 04:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
ago um a lot of that was you know really
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
kind of made up for um or or not quite
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
made up for the inflation that was being
 
04:10:01.149 --> 04:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
seen at the time I don't know Danielle
 
04:10:02.790 --> 04:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
do you have something else to add I do
 
04:10:04.349 --> 04:10:04.359 align:start position:0%
in addition to those things there's high
 
04:10:06.670 --> 04:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
demand for those positions elsewhere so
 
04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
on the on the highway maintainer side
 
04:10:11.349 --> 04:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities are are also looking for
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
the same kind of position so there are
 
04:10:16.349 --> 04:10:16.359 align:start position:0%
options for employees on the engineering
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
side what we're finding is there are
 
04:10:20.309 --> 04:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
fewer graduates of of in civil
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
engineering and a great demand for it so
 
04:10:25.109 --> 04:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
there there are great there are
 
04:10:27.670 --> 04:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
Consultants uh consultant agencies so
 
04:10:29.309 --> 04:10:29.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different options for
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
employees aside from the state
 
04:10:33.950 --> 04:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative piji thank you Mr
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for answering
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
questions just to clarify what you just
 
04:10:40.590 --> 04:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
said uh I'm assuming you have some wage
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
studies wage comparisons on how we Faire
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
you know in paying for the same type of
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
job versus municipalities or other
 
04:10:48.910 --> 04:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
states we may be competing with
 
04:10:51.189 --> 04:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
something to shed just a little bit of
 
04:10:52.830 --> 04:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
light we don't want to Del overly de
 
04:10:54.510 --> 04:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
deeply but just to get an understanding
 
04:10:56.590 --> 04:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
overall if you could share that at a
 
04:10:58.510 --> 04:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
later point that would be great
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
certainly yeah thank you I
 
04:11:03.070 --> 04:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
do no thank you very much for the for
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
the for the interesting questions um
 
04:11:08.429 --> 04:11:08.439 align:start position:0%
moving ahead the the next slide just
 
04:11:10.510 --> 04:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
gives some facts and figures about the
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
dot so you just get a general sense of
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
the side of the um size of the agency
 
04:11:19.710 --> 04:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
and the uh breadth of our coverage so we
 
04:11:21.309 --> 04:11:21.319 align:start position:0%
have about
 
04:11:24.910 --> 04:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
1,650 uh full-time permanent positions
 
04:11:27.389 --> 04:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
um budgeted as I said they're not all
 
04:11:28.990 --> 04:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
they're not all fold we're we're dealing
 
04:11:32.149 --> 04:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
with a approximately a 23 to 25% vacancy
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
rate we maintain uh
 
04:11:37.710 --> 04:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
2159 State Bridges we inspect every
 
04:11:39.469 --> 04:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
bridge in the state that includes the
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
other 1,700 or so Municipal Bridges um
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
can you provide lists those two lists
 
04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
the state red list and the municipal red
 
04:11:51.030 --> 04:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
list to Mr Lander again yes certainly Y
 
04:11:55.469 --> 04:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
and I believe um yes we as
 
04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets yes yes no we do I LW I I'm
 
04:12:02.109 --> 04:12:02.119 align:start position:0%
just thinking the law had changed uh
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
several years ago we do a annual report
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
it goes to the governor's office I
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
believe it goes to like the speaker of
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
the house and the and the and the and
 
04:12:12.030 --> 04:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
the um president of the Senate but we
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
can certainly get it to the uh
 
04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
commission I know we provide it to our
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
policy committee house Public Works and
 
04:12:19.870 --> 04:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
stuff so um that's available and we'll
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
get it to them to you
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
yep um the next page again I don't want
 
04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
to belabor it uh there's just um you
 
04:12:31.109 --> 04:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
know a uh some of those key facts we do
 
04:12:34.389 --> 04:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
have a a a lot of miles of roadway and
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
pavement and and other ancillary um uh
 
04:12:41.149 --> 04:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
traffic hardware and impertinences that
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
we are uh that it's that it's our
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
mission and that we're responsible for
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining uh we also uh maintain about
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
194 miles of active state-owned railroad
 
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
lines and uh we administer and
 
04:12:58.149 --> 04:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
distribute funding that supports 25
 
04:13:00.670 --> 04:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible airports and 11
 
04:13:04.030 --> 04:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
local public transit systems so in One
 
04:13:06.309 --> 04:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
Way Or Another We're um involved in
 
04:13:07.750 --> 04:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
Touching with all modes of
 
04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
transportation in the
 
04:13:12.910 --> 04:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
state the um the next slide about dot
 
04:13:14.830 --> 04:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
fun funding sources um I don't want to
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
read it but I'm going to spend a little
 
04:13:17.309 --> 04:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
bit of time here because this really
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
does kind of explain the um the basis of
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
the Department's
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
funding um so our budget has
 
04:13:28.429 --> 04:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for uh four from four
 
04:13:32.109 --> 04:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
fund from four sources of funding
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
um these are going to be a general
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
overview and as I get into some of the
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
further presentation division by
 
04:13:40.429 --> 04:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
division I'll um fill in a little bit
 
04:13:42.389 --> 04:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
more about where and how it fits in and
 
04:13:45.149 --> 04:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
how it's implement mented but um as a
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
general overview um federal funds we
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
receive federal funds and federal
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
revenue from several different agencies
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
primarily focused on what mode of
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
transportation they they support um so
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
we get funding from fhwa which supports
 
04:14:04.750 --> 04:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
the surface Transportation program FTA
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
which supports uh transit systems FAA
 
04:14:12.469 --> 04:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
which supports the aeronautic um the uh
 
04:14:14.429 --> 04:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
the airport and those aeronautic
 
04:14:18.910 --> 04:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
Services um FTA and FAA we don't have a
 
04:14:21.710 --> 04:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
lot of Hands-On
 
04:14:25.469 --> 04:14:25.479 align:start position:0%
um uh implementation of those funds we
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
are generally a pass through but our
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
agency is the uh State administer of
 
04:14:33.149 --> 04:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
those funds so those funds flow through
 
04:14:35.109 --> 04:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
us to other agencies they flow through
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
us through our budget and you'll see
 
04:14:40.750 --> 04:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
those um on the um and and one thing to
 
04:14:42.189 --> 04:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
point out that all of these federal
 
04:14:45.189 --> 04:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
funds are are typically restricted to
 
04:14:50.189 --> 04:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
certain uses in certain modes um so um
 
04:14:52.109 --> 04:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
it is a little Nuance as we talk about
 
04:14:53.910 --> 04:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
our our budget and and and things
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
because even though they're general fund
 
04:15:00.389 --> 04:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
federal funds um we cannot Flex Federal
 
04:15:02.990 --> 04:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
Transit funds to use for highways and
 
04:15:05.590 --> 04:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
bridges and so forth and most of the
 
04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
federal funds particularly the F fhwa
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway funds they are
 
04:15:13.149 --> 04:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
restricted to capital projects only we
 
04:15:16.030 --> 04:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
cannot use federal funds for operations
 
04:15:18.990 --> 04:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
and and maintenance activities and all
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
of these federal funds require some sort
 
04:15:25.750 --> 04:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
of State match and how that match is um
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
met um varies um varies by uh a number
 
04:15:32.109 --> 04:15:32.119 align:start position:0%
of the modes and and how they're
 
04:15:33.550 --> 04:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
administered and I'll get into that in a
 
04:15:35.349 --> 04:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
later the next source of funds we
 
04:15:40.830 --> 04:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
receive and we utilize are Highway funds
 
04:15:42.429 --> 04:15:42.439 align:start position:0%
and the highway funds are the primary
 
04:15:44.950 --> 04:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
source of revenue for our operations and
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance as I pointed out earlier we
 
04:15:50.189 --> 04:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
can't use federal funds for maintenance
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
so uh that falls to the state highway
 
04:15:57.269 --> 04:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
fund um that also is uh a source of
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
funds through that we um distribute
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
block grant Aid to
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and and it goes
 
04:16:07.630 --> 04:16:07.640 align:start position:0%
towards the debt service on our capital
 
04:16:09.870 --> 04:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
projects and the revenue that's
 
04:16:11.790 --> 04:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
generated from the highway fund comes
 
04:16:14.189 --> 04:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
primarily through the road toll uh the
 
04:16:16.830 --> 04:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
gas tax and vehicle registration
 
04:16:20.109 --> 04:16:20.119 align:start position:0%
fees and the use of um Highway funds is
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
restricted by the state constitution to
 
04:16:25.550 --> 04:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
specifically surface
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation the um third set of funds
 
04:16:30.269 --> 04:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
that we use as the turnpike funds
 
04:16:34.590 --> 04:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds uh come from the um not
 
04:16:36.990 --> 04:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
the road toll but the toll plazas and
 
04:16:41.109 --> 04:16:41.119 align:start position:0%
the toll booths on the turnpike system
 
04:16:43.389 --> 04:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
um that's the primary source of funding
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
for capital projects operations and
 
04:16:48.189 --> 04:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance on a small subset of our
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
freeways that are that comprise the uh
 
04:16:54.109 --> 04:16:54.119 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system and the Turnpike system
 
04:16:56.510 --> 04:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
is an enterprise system which means that
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
it is supported by the toll Revenue that
 
04:17:01.870 --> 04:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
comes in for it and that toll Revenue
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
can only be used on the turnpike system
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
it can't be used for other Highway and
 
04:17:10.469 --> 04:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
Bridge needs around the state um and
 
04:17:11.870 --> 04:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'll get into that in a little bit more
 
04:17:14.429 --> 04:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
detail and finally I'm sure you've heard
 
04:17:16.149 --> 04:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
a lot more from other agencies about
 
04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
General funds we have a very small
 
04:17:21.389 --> 04:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
portion of our operating budget um
 
04:17:24.590 --> 04:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's uh supported by the general funds
 
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
um it's primarily goes toward the
 
04:17:29.870 --> 04:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
nonsurface transportation areas uh
 
04:17:33.030 --> 04:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
including Personnel cost and Aeronautics
 
04:17:34.349 --> 04:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
uh Rail and
 
04:17:34.359 --> 04:17:36.149 align:start position:0%
uh Rail and
Transit

04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
Transit
 
04:17:39.149 --> 04:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
um and general funds in the past and
 
04:17:42.269 --> 04:17:42.279 align:start position:0%
past budgets have been used to support
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
and to to sort of bail out the highway
 
04:17:46.830 --> 04:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
fund there have been infusions of
 
04:17:50.349 --> 04:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
General funds into the highway fund to
 
04:17:54.429 --> 04:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
um um to meet uh to meet budget
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
needs and finally uh even though it's
 
04:17:59.070 --> 04:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily part of our operating
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
budget under hb25 is the capital budget
 
04:18:05.229 --> 04:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
um we look at the primary the the
 
04:18:08.469 --> 04:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
primary use for um we and I bring that
 
04:18:10.870 --> 04:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
up here because the capital funds the
 
04:18:13.630 --> 04:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
hb25 it is a source of some of the match
 
04:18:16.349 --> 04:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
for some of those
 
04:18:20.349 --> 04:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
um uh Transit and Aeronautics uh
 
04:18:23.910 --> 04:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
projects so the state match for uh some
 
04:18:26.830 --> 04:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
of the transit and uh Aeronautics uses
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
comes from the um capital
 
04:18:32.309 --> 04:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
budget any questions on the general
 
04:18:35.550 --> 04:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
things uh before I move ahead just one
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
who actually controls the highway fund
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
is it your department or the one we just
 
04:18:44.309 --> 04:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
saw uh I a long answer to that would
 
04:18:46.630 --> 04:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
probably be the legislature so it
 
04:18:49.510 --> 04:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
controls it yeah okay uh I we do say and
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
I have something down here father the
 
04:18:54.429 --> 04:18:54.439 align:start position:0%
dot despite the despite the highway and
 
04:18:56.910 --> 04:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
and the name we're not the highway fund
 
04:18:59.109 --> 04:18:59.119 align:start position:0%
and uh and the highway fund is not the
 
04:19:04.030 --> 04:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
do so the highway fund is um is is where
 
04:19:09.429 --> 04:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
revenue from um gas tax and um uh motor
 
04:19:12.189 --> 04:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration fees flow into and
 
04:19:15.030 --> 04:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's approp op at out by uh by the
 
04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
legislature to various State agencies
 
04:19:20.229 --> 04:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
the dot is uh one of the bigger
 
04:19:22.469 --> 04:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
recipients of IT department of safety is
 
04:19:26.510 --> 04:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
the uh Second and um and then also to
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities and I have a little bit
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
more detail in that but Department of
 
04:19:33.469 --> 04:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
Safety collects the revenue
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh they necessar appropriated by
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.750 --> 04:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
so I I highlighted the uh four sets of
 
04:19:48.389 --> 04:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
funds just in uh the next Slide the
 
04:19:50.149 --> 04:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
funding summary the types of funds it
 
04:19:52.990 --> 04:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
gives you just uh a highlevel breakout
 
04:19:55.950 --> 04:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
of of how much of of each of those funds
 
04:19:59.950 --> 04:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
are in our in our in our budget so um
 
04:20:02.630 --> 04:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
primarily the overall budget is uh the
 
04:20:04.590 --> 04:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
biggest percentage is the federal funds
 
04:20:07.469 --> 04:20:07.479 align:start position:0%
on the bottom there in blue the second
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
um biggest share of funding is the is
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
the highway Fund in in the middle and I
 
04:20:14.590 --> 04:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
would just point to the little green
 
04:20:18.670 --> 04:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
line in the middle there about 2 or. 3%
 
04:20:22.349 --> 04:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
that that constitutes the um M you know
 
04:20:24.030 --> 04:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
minor amount of General funds that
 
04:20:27.389 --> 04:20:27.399 align:start position:0%
support those non-surface Transportation
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
bureaus on the following Slide the pie
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
charts it gives a little bit more of a
 
04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
breakdown um and it helps us to explain
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
and and and sort out this bigger budget
 
04:20:43.830 --> 04:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
in a in a way so we tend to look at our
 
04:20:47.990 --> 04:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
budget in two major parts um the bigger
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
slice on the on the left we call
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal Aid and construction a lot of
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
that is the federal funds that flow
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
through our budget and go to the
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
construction programs that go to the aid
 
04:21:01.630 --> 04:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
to the city of towns that go to the um
 
04:21:04.590 --> 04:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
Transit agencies that go to the to the
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
um to the airport type of project so
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
that um is all we can I consider it more
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
more pass through and it's primarily F
 
04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
Federal Federal um federal funds on on
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
that slice of the pie on the rightand
 
04:21:24.750 --> 04:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
side is the operating budget and um
 
04:21:28.429 --> 04:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
that's about 46 48% of our overall state
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
budget um and that is the operating cost
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
of our staff of our Personnel of the
 
04:21:37.149 --> 04:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
equipment of the resources needed to
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
maintain and um operate the
 
04:21:44.109 --> 04:21:44.119 align:start position:0%
transportation system so on the where
 
04:21:46.349 --> 04:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
where the municipal Aid and construction
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
primarily constitutes the federal funds
 
04:21:51.269 --> 04:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
that we receive the operating budget is
 
04:21:54.149 --> 04:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
primarily funded by the by the highway
 
04:21:58.590 --> 04:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
fund um one other point I would make uh
 
04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
that a lot of our budget discussion even
 
04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
though all of these funds are part of
 
04:22:04.990 --> 04:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
our budget most of the budget
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
discussions at this time of year are
 
04:22:10.229 --> 04:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
focused around the operating budget um
 
04:22:13.349 --> 04:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
and where we have uh more discretion to
 
04:22:16.590 --> 04:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
make make uh make changes and and um
 
04:22:19.950 --> 04:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
where the driving um budgetary needs are
 
04:22:23.710 --> 04:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
met the municipal Aid in construction um
 
04:22:26.550 --> 04:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of the choices of where funds are
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
investment invested in types of projects
 
04:22:32.349 --> 04:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
and specific projects um even though the
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
dollars flow through our budget a lot of
 
04:22:36.309 --> 04:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
that is decided in the off budget year
 
04:22:39.189 --> 04:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
when we uh take up the uh banal update
 
04:22:41.550 --> 04:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
of the state's 10-year Transportation
 
04:22:43.149 --> 04:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
program so
 
04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully that adds a little context and
 
04:22:46.990 --> 04:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the overall budget and the
 
04:22:49.109 --> 04:22:49.119 align:start position:0%
percentages of the budget are shown
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
there as well
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
too so the from from here I was going to
 
04:22:56.030 --> 04:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
kind of break it down I had noted that
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
we have five divisions uh and I I kind
 
04:23:01.389 --> 04:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
of take it division by division uh
 
04:23:03.109 --> 04:23:03.119 align:start position:0%
because each division has you know their
 
04:23:05.229 --> 04:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
own kind of funding source and and
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
things like that so that's that's where
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
we're at now and I'll give you from an
 
04:23:10.670 --> 04:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
introduction just a general overview of
 
04:23:14.990 --> 04:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
each division As It Go so the um so the
 
04:23:18.670 --> 04:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
next two slides uh the top one gives a
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
brief summary of the division of
 
04:23:22.830 --> 04:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics Rail and Transit um it's
 
04:23:24.910 --> 04:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
made up of three bureaus Aeronautics
 
04:23:28.229 --> 04:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
which um help support the funding and
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
and administers the funding and the FAA
 
04:23:33.269 --> 04:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
grants to the 12 federally funded
 
04:23:34.790 --> 04:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
airports and there's some facts and
 
04:23:36.349 --> 04:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
figures there about the Aeronautics
 
04:23:42.149 --> 04:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
bureo uh the rail Bureau um that um uh
 
04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
ad administers and and oversees the six
 
04:23:48.429 --> 04:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
Active uh operating agreements and the
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
194 miles of active state-owned Rail and
 
04:23:55.469 --> 04:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
finally the public transit um Bureau
 
04:23:57.870 --> 04:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
which oversees and administers the FTA
 
04:24:01.830 --> 04:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
funds uh to the 11 local public transit
 
04:24:06.910 --> 04:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
agencies and systems there is one um one
 
04:24:09.510 --> 04:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh bus service that that the state
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
administers fairly directly and that is
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
is the Boston Boston express route the
 
04:24:17.710 --> 04:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
commuta service that we run on the i93
 
04:24:20.510 --> 04:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
quarter uh between Manchester and
 
04:24:25.630 --> 04:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:30.030 --> 04:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:33.109 --> 04:24:33.119 align:start position:0%
airports the um I can get you a list of
 
04:24:35.109 --> 04:24:35.119 align:start position:0%
them but the uh well what what what does
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
it mean that they're block rain airport
 
04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire is a little bit unique
 
04:24:41.429 --> 04:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
in in the state that that we have black
 
04:24:45.109 --> 04:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
Grant so we essentially serve as FAA in
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
administering those those funds so funds
 
04:24:50.429 --> 04:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
from FAA come to New Hampshire and in
 
04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
blocks and we administer them to the um
 
04:24:57.030 --> 04:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
federal aid eligible airports other
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
states other states uh most of those
 
04:25:02.750 --> 04:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
airports are dealing directly with with
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
FAA on the administration of those funds
 
04:25:08.070 --> 04:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
so this basically private airports no
 
04:25:09.550 --> 04:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
these are these are mun these are
 
04:25:11.910 --> 04:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
typically Municipal public owned Public
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
Access airports oh okay and the three
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
that do have direct um um interactions
 
04:25:21.389 --> 04:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
with with FAA are the three commercial
 
04:25:24.790 --> 04:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
airports which are Lebanon uh peas and
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester Boston Regional Airport the
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
other um I don't have a full list of the
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
10 block 10 block grant airports but the
 
04:25:34.750 --> 04:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
other um like con public airports like
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
conquered yeah conquered lonia um
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
Keen I'd have to see Sky Haven is a
 
04:25:43.950 --> 04:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
little bit different because that's
 
04:25:49.149 --> 04:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
under the PDA but um Baki see pardon me
 
04:25:50.109 --> 04:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
the ice
 
04:25:52.830 --> 04:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
airport the ice P airport is not a
 
04:25:55.630 --> 04:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
federal aid eligible airport but uh It
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
Is overseen by uh by our Aeronautics
 
04:26:01.510 --> 04:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau you're right yeah yeah thank you
 
04:26:01.520 --> 04:26:02.990 align:start position:0%
Bureau you're right yeah yeah thank you
you're

04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
welcome um and there are like say on on
 
04:26:08.109 --> 04:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
that there are 12 airports that do not
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
receive federal aid those would be like
 
04:26:13.070 --> 04:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
the ice airport um I up in my area of
 
04:26:15.389 --> 04:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
the woods Plymouth is much more of a of
 
04:26:17.189 --> 04:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
a of a landing strip there are a number
 
04:26:19.710 --> 04:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
of those smaller airports that don't
 
04:26:24.109 --> 04:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:24.119 --> 04:26:26.550 align:start position:0%
 
requirements

04:26:26.550 --> 04:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
sure and uh on the final slide is just
 
04:26:30.750 --> 04:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
some facts and figures there a little
 
04:26:32.990 --> 04:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
bit more of a breakdown of the uh costs
 
04:26:35.550 --> 04:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
under the Aeronautics Rail and Transit
 
04:26:38.550 --> 04:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
um and you can see that that 2% of the
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
general fund this is this is where it
 
04:26:43.710 --> 04:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
kind of goes about 1.8 million that that
 
04:26:46.670 --> 04:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
that goes to the Personnel costs um in
 
04:26:49.469 --> 04:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
this this Bureau um as I said a lot of
 
04:26:51.389 --> 04:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
this is passed through Federal funding
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
as a primary
 
04:26:57.109 --> 04:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
um um source of revenue for Aeronautics
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh and Transit programs uh these those
 
04:27:02.590 --> 04:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
bureaus administer those
 
04:27:06.750 --> 04:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
um and um I would point out that all of
 
04:27:09.750 --> 04:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
these uh Federal funding do require a
 
04:27:12.189 --> 04:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
match and as I said the FAA funds are
 
04:27:14.550 --> 04:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
are matched with capital funds Transit
 
04:27:17.309 --> 04:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
State match is budgeted uh with General
 
04:27:20.030 --> 04:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
funds um that is contained in in our
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
budget um most of the transit match um
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
falls on the local operating systems and
 
04:27:30.630 --> 04:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
the um cities and towns that operate
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
those those operating those transit
 
04:27:36.309 --> 04:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
systems representative Pap V thank you
 
04:27:38.030 --> 04:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just a quick question you
 
04:27:40.309 --> 04:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that Boston Express is
 
04:27:43.109 --> 04:27:43.119 align:start position:0%
mostly operated by us mhm I probably
 
04:27:44.510 --> 04:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
should have remembered that from two
 
04:27:46.510 --> 04:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
years ago but could you please just give
 
04:27:49.870 --> 04:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
me a quick explanation as to why we're
 
04:27:51.469 --> 04:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
doing that I'm presuming that we have an
 
04:27:53.710 --> 04:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
interest in ensuring easy transportation
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
to Boston and back but why are we you
 
04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
know involved with Boston Express yeah
 
04:28:02.309 --> 04:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
part of it was the the the big the big
 
04:28:03.750 --> 04:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
gist of it came from when we were
 
04:28:07.349 --> 04:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
building um Interstate 93 when that i93
 
04:28:09.910 --> 04:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
widening project came along it was a
 
04:28:13.309 --> 04:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
commitment to um during the construction
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
phase to um support um alternative modes
 
04:28:20.429 --> 04:28:20.439 align:start position:0%
of transportation and and support um
 
04:28:22.750 --> 04:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
commuta bus service to help alleviate
 
04:28:25.309 --> 04:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
some of the traffic impacts during
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
Construction Construction for i93 went
 
04:28:30.630 --> 04:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
on for eight eight or nine years and it
 
04:28:35.389 --> 04:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
really became a um um dependent upon
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
service when when i93 was completed the
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
construction was completed um through
 
04:28:44.309 --> 04:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
the a plan process it was decided that
 
04:28:46.510 --> 04:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh there was value to the continued
 
04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
commuter um bus service in that Corridor
 
04:28:53.469 --> 04:28:53.479 align:start position:0%
um so it so it has continued as a state
 
04:28:55.950 --> 04:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
um supported
 
04:29:00.550 --> 04:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
um uh service you're
 
04:29:03.189 --> 04:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
welcome private service in the quarter
 
04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
primarily serves um Logan Airport our
 
04:29:10.389 --> 04:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
focus is is on commuter bus service
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
supporting commuters from uh from New
 
04:29:17.189 --> 04:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to the Boston Regional area
 
04:29:20.189 --> 04:29:20.199 align:start position:0%
so sure by all means uh one of the
 
04:29:23.109 --> 04:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
things that I wanted to add here is um
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
we are seeing some additional pressures
 
04:29:27.870 --> 04:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
for additional general fund revenue for
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
this this small group tied to um
 
04:29:33.630 --> 04:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
additional expense burdens that are
 
04:29:35.710 --> 04:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
related to benefits and overhead and
 
04:29:37.510 --> 04:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
indirect charges that are caused that
 
04:29:40.109 --> 04:29:40.119 align:start position:0%
are charged to that area and not a lot
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
of place to find those that funding and
 
04:29:46.990 --> 04:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
so we are not able to get that funding
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
um we would maximize any federal funding
 
04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
if it was available to use for those
 
04:29:54.389 --> 04:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
things but they're not and so the only
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
other source of funding that we would
 
04:29:57.149 --> 04:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
have would be General funds and we've
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
seen increases pretty significant
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
increases in benefits and indirect costs
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
um that we're having uh a little bit of
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
a difficult time funding and would
 
04:30:08.910 --> 04:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
require some additional General funds
 
04:30:10.429 --> 04:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
and could you detail this not right now
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:23.349 --> 04:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
make um moving moving on um a little bit
 
04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
more detail on the next slot next two
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
slides about uh project development
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
Bureau and the revenue overview so
 
04:30:33.429 --> 04:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
project development is the um division
 
04:30:35.670 --> 04:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
that uh really administers the Federal
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
Highway funds and really um um
 
04:30:41.229 --> 04:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
administers our um construction program
 
04:30:42.870 --> 04:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
for roads and bridges so all the
 
04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
planning design permitting property
 
04:30:49.030 --> 04:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions construction oversight um
 
04:30:51.950 --> 04:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
falls under uh project development
 
04:30:55.590 --> 04:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
Bureau um and the federal funds along
 
04:30:57.670 --> 04:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
with the restricted Highway funds are
 
04:31:00.670 --> 04:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
the primary revenue sources for uh for
 
04:31:02.670 --> 04:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
that Division and for that uh for those
 
04:31:05.189 --> 04:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
projects and as I said earlier a lot of
 
04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
those decisions around um levels of
 
04:31:10.469 --> 04:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
investment and Paving and bridges and
 
04:31:13.990 --> 04:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
which which which uh projects um get
 
04:31:16.870 --> 04:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
funded uh is contained in the 10-year
 
04:31:20.109 --> 04:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
Transportation plan uh that gets updated
 
04:31:22.229 --> 04:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
every every two years and that will be
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
starting this this summer uh and and
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
come to the legislature next next
 
04:31:32.830 --> 04:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
session but in in general um orders of
 
04:31:36.189 --> 04:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
magnitude we receive about 225 million
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
doll a year in Federal Highway funds
 
04:31:40.590 --> 04:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
that support that that
 
04:31:42.910 --> 04:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
program um and it goes towards the
 
04:31:44.710 --> 04:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
development and oversight of Highway and
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
Bridge designs the Environmental
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
Compliance right of way
 
04:31:51.630 --> 04:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
acquisition uh some of those funds are
 
04:31:55.070 --> 04:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh passed through to uh some Municipal
 
04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh Aid projects uh dealing with cities
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
and towns and uh we oversee all of the
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
um all of the state construction as as
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
well too so that $225 million a year
 
04:32:09.630 --> 04:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
that's what we call our formula funds
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's the apportionment from from
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway way um there are
 
04:32:15.870 --> 04:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
additional funds that can come that can
 
04:32:18.870 --> 04:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
flow into that depending on you know how
 
04:32:21.469 --> 04:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
the federal program is going any one one
 
04:32:24.550 --> 04:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
year um in the last few days with some
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
of the um um executive orders and stuff
 
04:32:31.389 --> 04:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
you may have heard about a discretionary
 
04:32:33.550 --> 04:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
grants and things put putting on hold
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
but that is that is uh you know
 
04:32:39.389 --> 04:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue if we uh compete for
 
04:32:41.309 --> 04:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
uh certain discretionary grants and
 
04:32:43.510 --> 04:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
things like that that's another uh area
 
04:32:46.990 --> 04:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
that gets funded um and every year
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
there's also a um a redistribution of
 
04:32:53.389 --> 04:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
federal funds that happens every year um
 
04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
other states that aren't able to use all
 
04:32:58.269 --> 04:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
of their Federal allotment um it gets
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
turned in and redistributed to other
 
04:33:03.870 --> 04:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
states we have uh in the last several
 
04:33:07.949 --> 04:33:07.959 align:start position:0%
years been um fortunate enough to be
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
poised and ready with projects that
 
04:33:12.551 --> 04:33:12.561 align:start position:0%
we've been able to utilize you know in
 
04:33:15.150 --> 04:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
the order of 30 to $33 million
 
04:33:18.310 --> 04:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
additional um federal funds through re
 
04:33:22.109 --> 04:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
redistribution every year so um that's a
 
04:33:24.750 --> 04:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
broad uh overview in in the general
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
amount of of of funding and I mentioned
 
04:33:29.709 --> 04:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
that about some of the additional um
 
04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
funds because the total revenue on the
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
on the following slide flowing through
 
04:33:38.349 --> 04:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
uh project development is about $373
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
million um the biggest part of that is
 
04:33:42.510 --> 04:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
the federal funds but there are also
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
restricted State funds as well as
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
Turnpike Capital funds that go into that
 
04:33:52.189 --> 04:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
construction program as well too um
 
04:33:56.830 --> 04:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh one thing i' I'd point out I I
 
04:33:58.470 --> 04:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
I reiterate again that these federal
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
funds can't be used for uh maintenance
 
04:34:02.990 --> 04:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
or operation so it's very much dedicated
 
04:34:04.470 --> 04:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
to the construction
 
04:34:08.230 --> 04:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
program but um even in light of that we
 
04:34:12.269 --> 04:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
do try out of necessity and and and and
 
04:34:14.590 --> 04:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
um just one second sure can you make
 
04:34:16.189 --> 04:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
sure it's not locked so that people can
 
04:34:16.199 --> 04:34:18.269 align:start position:0%
sure it's not locked so that people can
get

04:34:18.269 --> 04:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:25.990 --> 04:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
yeah good perfect I'm sorry I didn't
 
04:34:27.789 --> 04:34:27.799 align:start position:0%
didn't notice thank you and thank you
 
04:34:30.029 --> 04:34:30.039 align:start position:0%
for the interuption
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah um I was about the the third bullet
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
down on that on that slide talking about
 
04:34:37.390 --> 04:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
direct and indirect federal revenue
 
04:34:40.510 --> 04:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursements but um we try to leverage
 
04:34:42.750 --> 04:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
the fund the the federal funds as as
 
04:34:45.949 --> 04:34:45.959 align:start position:0%
much as we can to um to support our
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
operating needs and lessen the burden
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
and lessen the impact on the on the
 
04:34:53.189 --> 04:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
highway fund um primarily out of out of
 
04:34:56.629 --> 04:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
out of necessity so um you know some of
 
04:34:58.869 --> 04:34:58.879 align:start position:0%
the direct and indirect Federal uh
 
04:35:02.590 --> 04:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
funding um we other states don't but we
 
04:35:05.189 --> 04:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
do a an indirect cost assessment uh
 
04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:07.039 align:start position:0%
looking at all our administrative costs
 
04:35:08.670 --> 04:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
and everything that support the federal
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
program and um we um
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
we uh I'm gonna say it colloquially
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
Danielle could probably say it better
 
04:35:21.830 --> 04:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
but we we put a we put a 10% charge we
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
we take uh 10% for toward our um
 
04:35:28.150 --> 04:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
indirect cost of of every Federal dollar
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
that we that we Bild um is that the
 
04:35:33.510 --> 04:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
right way to put it yeah it is so every
 
04:35:36.029 --> 04:35:36.039 align:start position:0%
year we are required to provide an
 
04:35:38.709 --> 04:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
indirect cost um analysis to the federal
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
government and it it depend you know
 
04:35:43.949 --> 04:35:43.959 align:start position:0%
there's a formula and it depends on the
 
04:35:47.551 --> 04:35:47.561 align:start position:0%
the um charges that we've had in certain
 
04:35:51.629 --> 04:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
areas and we have typically um been
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
approved for a 10% indirect cost rate
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
that indirect cost rate pays for
 
04:35:59.230 --> 04:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
salaries it pays for salaries for
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
support staff people who are doing
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
billing HR any kind of any kind of
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
position that would be in the support of
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
a federal program those positions are
 
04:36:11.189 --> 04:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
generally multif funded and by that I
 
04:36:13.029 --> 04:36:13.039 align:start position:0%
mean they would be funded by indirect
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
fed costs they would be funded by
 
04:36:17.470 --> 04:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
Turnpike um Turnpike dollars and they
 
04:36:19.109 --> 04:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
would be funded by Highway fund dollars
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
as well that's what I mean by by multif
 
04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
funded right so it get it does get a
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
little complicated but we do try to
 
04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
leverage those those federal funds we
 
04:36:32.510 --> 04:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
also have direct budgeted uh um federal
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
funds in various operating bureaus uh
 
04:36:38.590 --> 04:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
that support um primarily project
 
04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
development if they are um working on on
 
04:36:43.029 --> 04:36:43.039 align:start position:0%
a federal aid project and they're
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
billing directly to to to that uh
 
04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
project for the engineering or the
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
construction oversight we do um we do
 
04:36:54.109 --> 04:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
direct budget those federal funds to
 
04:36:56.470 --> 04:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
support those costs so what is the
 
04:36:58.629 --> 04:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
lesses available for funding additional
 
04:37:02.750 --> 04:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
projects mean comparatively other states
 
04:37:02.760 --> 04:37:03.551 align:start position:0%
projects mean comparatively other states
uh

04:37:03.551 --> 04:37:03.561 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:06.269 --> 04:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
will will utilize all of their
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
construction fund all of their federal
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
funds strictly for construction and and
 
04:37:14.230 --> 04:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
they will um they will fund the match
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
they will fund uh those indirect costs
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
they will fund um those um Personnel
 
04:37:23.789 --> 04:37:23.799 align:start position:0%
positions that are doing that work with
 
04:37:27.269 --> 04:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
with State funds um we we've had a lot
 
04:37:29.789 --> 04:37:29.799 align:start position:0%
of projects with with Vermont Interstate
 
04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
projects with Vermont in in Maine and
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
and it's created some interesting
 
04:37:36.590 --> 04:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
discussions because we we we talk to
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
them and we we we go to build them that
 
04:37:43.230 --> 04:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
that 10% indirect rate and and they uh
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
they really don't know what we're
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
talking about because they because again
 
04:37:48.230 --> 04:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
they don't administer their federal
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
funds the same way
 
04:37:53.789 --> 04:37:53.799 align:start position:0%
so Murray yeah thank you since we're on
 
04:37:55.869 --> 04:37:55.879 align:start position:0%
that I think we're it's in sort of the
 
04:37:59.949 --> 04:37:59.959 align:start position:0%
same vein we use tax credits to collect
 
04:38:02.709 --> 04:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
to to match for federal funds whereas a
 
04:38:05.310 --> 04:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
lot of the other states um the money
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
comes directly from the government
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
they're not using tax credits they're
 
04:38:10.310 --> 04:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
using State funds for that and so
 
04:38:12.750 --> 04:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
basically we don't get the value of 100%
 
04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the federal dollars because it we
 
04:38:17.629 --> 04:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
have to use the tax credits for that so
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
can you speak since we're on that topic
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
can you just speak a little bit and I
 
04:38:22.189 --> 04:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
forget what that thing is called it's
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
the very next bullet I was just getting
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
to that so you it's actually called uh
 
04:38:29.470 --> 04:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
Turnpike toll credits um so again yeah
 
04:38:32.189 --> 04:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
most every uh Federal dollar comes with
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
a matching requirement most of the
 
04:38:36.189 --> 04:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway fund dollars are match
 
04:38:40.349 --> 04:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
20% um so it's 80% Federal 20% State
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
match um um we have leveraged the
 
04:38:48.029 --> 04:38:48.039 align:start position:0%
investment of State funds Turnpike funds
 
04:38:50.349 --> 04:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
uh that go into the turnpike system and
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
we are able to um utilize those funds
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
and claim a credit Federal Highway
 
04:38:59.230 --> 04:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
recognizes that credit and allows us to
 
04:39:01.750 --> 04:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
use that credit as a as a match to the
 
04:39:05.750 --> 04:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
federal program so it's not funding but
 
04:39:08.551 --> 04:39:08.561 align:start position:0%
it is a credit so it allows us to use
 
04:39:12.750 --> 04:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
those federal funds at um at a at a 100%
 
04:39:17.230 --> 04:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
rate versus an 80% rate with a 20% match
 
04:39:20.109 --> 04:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
um it limits I think what you were
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
getting at representative it does our
 
04:39:24.510 --> 04:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
our federal funds don't go as far
 
04:39:27.789 --> 04:39:27.799 align:start position:0%
because we are spending them at 100%
 
04:39:32.109 --> 04:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
versus at 80% with a 20% match but so in
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
the upshot of of this is you know we put
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
very little State funds into our our
 
04:39:40.750 --> 04:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
federal program um it's good for the
 
04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
state budget it's it's good for meeting
 
04:39:46.910 --> 04:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
the highway fund needs um it does have
 
04:39:48.910 --> 04:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
some limitations on on the amount of
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:55.910 --> 04:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
particularly um vulnerable or
 
04:39:58.750 --> 04:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
susceptible to uh changes in federal
 
04:40:02.110 --> 04:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
funding so um particularly some of the
 
04:40:03.830 --> 04:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
discussions that have been going on this
 
04:40:07.230 --> 04:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
week about um you know potential halts
 
04:40:09.550 --> 04:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
to you know Federal Federal
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
dispersements and stuff like that
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
we are very much at the mercy of that
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
because we have no State funds to back
 
04:40:19.270 --> 04:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
that up so that that's some of the
 
04:40:19.280 --> 04:40:22.070 align:start position:0%
that up so that that's some of the
nuances

04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:24.788 --> 04:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
there um there aren't any further
 
04:40:26.350 --> 04:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
questions going on there are some
 
04:40:28.110 --> 04:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
restricted Highway funds that go into to
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
support our Capital program um and those
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
are listed there at the bottom 2. Cent
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
2.6 cents of the of the gas tax goes to
 
04:40:39.830 --> 04:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
the um betterment program which is used
 
04:40:42.270 --> 04:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
primarily for theay saving program and
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
we utilize that for um nonfederal Aid uh
 
04:40:50.430 --> 04:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
State highways so about a third of our
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
state highway mileage because their
 
04:40:55.868 --> 04:40:55.878 align:start position:0%
lower tier roads or unnumbered state
 
04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
roads are uh not eligible for federal
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
aid so we depend on the betterment funds
 
04:41:03.670 --> 04:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
for the paving and upkeep and
 
04:41:05.910 --> 04:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance of those roads so I'm
 
04:41:09.070 --> 04:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
guessing that's RSA specified these the
 
04:41:11.708 --> 04:41:11.718 align:start position:0%
better stuff no it's actually a uh
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
Federal uh requirement based on the
 
04:41:16.830 --> 04:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
classification of of the of the of the
 
04:41:20.830 --> 04:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
road Federal F Federal classification
 
04:41:25.150 --> 04:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
yeah um there's also uh block rant Aid
 
04:41:28.868 --> 04:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
that's uh about 12% of the of the um of
 
04:41:32.628 --> 04:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
the road toll um that that by Statute uh
 
04:41:34.590 --> 04:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
is distributed to cities and towns it's
 
04:41:37.150 --> 04:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
approximately $35 million a year that
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
flows through our our budget and we
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
disperse that to the cities and towns
 
04:41:45.868 --> 04:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
and uh there is also um a restricted
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
portion of the gas tax
 
04:41:53.830 --> 04:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
um that that got passed under SB 367 in
 
04:41:57.788 --> 04:41:57.798 align:start position:0%
2014 that was uh intended to pay for the
 
04:42:02.230 --> 04:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
i93 widening project we had um borrowed
 
04:42:04.830 --> 04:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
some money from a Federal Loan program
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
to complete the construction of i93 with
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
the pledge of this 4.2 Cent gas tax
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
increase to pay back those those loans
 
04:42:19.470 --> 04:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
um so um that is a restricted area of
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
that and and one of the reasons I bring
 
04:42:24.510 --> 04:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
that up and the the waterfall is shown
 
04:42:27.628 --> 04:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
on the on the next slide
 
04:42:31.550 --> 04:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
um you said intended did did did you was
 
04:42:32.550 --> 04:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
there an implication there that it
 
04:42:34.948 --> 04:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
wasn't used for that
 
04:42:37.390 --> 04:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
purpose that was the intent of of
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
passing the bill and the bill was passed
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
yes so that's what it um yeah sorry if I
 
04:42:44.350 --> 04:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
misspoke but that's what it is used for
 
04:42:48.788 --> 04:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
now um so for the last 10 years or so we
 
04:42:50.708 --> 04:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
have only the way the the way the loan
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the uh waterfall was structured
 
04:42:57.310 --> 04:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
we've only been paying um interest on
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
the on the debt service on on the bonds
 
04:43:03.070 --> 04:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
and the remaining uh money from that has
 
04:43:07.550 --> 04:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
gone to um rural Paving and and and and
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
bridges um so for the last 10 years
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
we've had about $20 million of of State
 
04:43:15.350 --> 04:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
funds from that 4.2 Cent gas tax
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
increase that has gone to uh Paving and
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
and Bridge repair um I bring this up now
 
04:43:23.788 --> 04:43:23.798 align:start position:0%
because in this fiscal year in this
 
04:43:29.070 --> 04:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
budget um we have to begin paying the um
 
04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
the full Debt Service for the i93
 
04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
project for the next um 10 years or so
 
04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
and the um the 10 years of uh about $20
 
04:43:41.350 --> 04:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
million a year that we have
 
04:43:44.310 --> 04:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
had the flexibility to invest in um
 
04:43:47.070 --> 04:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges um that money is now
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
going to Debt Service uh and that's
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
reflected in our budget and and stuff
 
04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
and it is something we will be
 
04:43:54.990 --> 04:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
discussing through the 10-year plan
 
04:43:59.788 --> 04:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
process how to make up that um
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
um what I perceive what well that
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
shortfall with other federal funds and
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
stuff but it is a little bit of a Nuance
 
04:44:08.350 --> 04:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
but it is reflected in our budget this
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
year that change in how the s sp36 funds
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
are used I'm sure there was a a reason
 
04:44:16.948 --> 04:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
for that going back was there when this
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
began was there something else that was
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
going on that we were paying the 20
 
04:44:22.510 --> 04:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
million towards in this words why did we
 
04:44:25.070 --> 04:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
wait until now to do this was it an
 
04:44:26.788 --> 04:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number we chose number of
 
04:44:26.798 --> 04:44:27.708 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number we chose number of
years

04:44:27.708 --> 04:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
or I was it was a structuring it it was
 
04:44:33.310 --> 04:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
the most advantageous to the state to um
 
04:44:35.948 --> 04:44:35.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to only pay debt service and
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
it was a very low interest uh loan that
 
04:44:41.628 --> 04:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
that we received so um I think the
 
04:44:43.788 --> 04:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
structure of it it was uh in the state's
 
04:44:45.190 --> 04:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
best interest to be able to Avail
 
04:44:48.350 --> 04:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves of of of the use of that
 
04:44:50.708 --> 04:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
revenue for the intervening years and
 
04:44:52.030 --> 04:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
and was low interest for only that
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
limited period of time whatever it's
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
been 20 years or something right it's
 
04:44:57.990 --> 04:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
1.09% for the loan and so it was
 
04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
structured deliberately to be able to
 
04:45:03.628 --> 04:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
provide that service um for for uh
 
04:45:06.190 --> 04:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
Paving and Bridge repair to the rural SE
 
04:45:11.070 --> 04:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
um sections that was a deliberate act um
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
and it allowed those those things to
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
happen Federal Loan I assume say again a
 
04:45:18.390 --> 04:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
Federal Loan the it is a Federal Loan
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative papich thank you Mr
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
chairman just to clarify what I hear you
 
04:45:25.708 --> 04:45:25.718 align:start position:0%
say is that the interest rate was fixed
 
04:45:27.390 --> 04:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
on the loan at
 
04:45:30.270 --> 04:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
1.09% we just made a decision because it
 
04:45:32.788 --> 04:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
was almost free money in terms of
 
04:45:35.470 --> 04:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
interest to just stretch the repayment
 
04:45:37.628 --> 04:45:37.638 align:start position:0%
as much as we can to get to basically
 
04:45:39.830 --> 04:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
decrease the present value money of what
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:50.670 --> 04:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so moving on the next uh the next
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
slide and this is very limited and
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully I can explain it uh talks
 
04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
about the turnpike fund revenue and uh
 
04:45:59.670 --> 04:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's probably easiest to explain what
 
04:46:02.750 --> 04:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system is and and and isn't
 
04:46:07.070 --> 04:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
so the turnpike system comprises three
 
04:46:11.190 --> 04:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
segments of freeway um freeway uh
 
04:46:15.030 --> 04:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
highways so I95 over in the Sea Coast
 
04:46:17.390 --> 04:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
that runs from Seabrook to uh
 
04:46:19.350 --> 04:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth um even though it's
 
04:46:21.788 --> 04:46:21.798 align:start position:0%
Interstate 95 it is a Turnpike supported
 
04:46:24.030 --> 04:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
by the toll plaza in Hampton the
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
Spalding Turnpike that runs from
 
04:46:28.430 --> 04:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth up to up to Milton is uh
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
likewise uh part of the turnpike system
 
04:46:33.830 --> 04:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
is supported by the um the toll plazas
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
in um in uh Dover and Rochester and the
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
central Turnpike even though it is I 93
 
04:46:43.750 --> 04:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
for most of the part of it uh the
 
04:46:45.430 --> 04:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
central New Hampshire Turnpike and then
 
04:46:46.990 --> 04:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
the Fe Everett Turnpike going down
 
04:46:49.390 --> 04:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
through NASA uh is a central New
 
04:46:51.670 --> 04:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Turnpike again supported by
 
04:46:54.750 --> 04:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
the toll plazas in Bedford and in and in
 
04:46:58.548 --> 04:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
hookit so um the overall Turnpike system
 
04:47:02.230 --> 04:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
is about 89 miles long comprises 172
 
04:47:04.510 --> 04:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
Bridges seven toll plazas and we have
 
04:47:08.070 --> 04:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
about 180 positions in the turnpike uh
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau that uh uh support the operation
 
04:47:13.430 --> 04:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
and maintenance um and it's an
 
04:47:16.628 --> 04:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
Enterprise fund so that by RSA all the
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
toll Revenue that comes to support those
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
systems can only be used on those on
 
04:47:24.030 --> 04:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
those Road roadways um it can't be used
 
04:47:27.070 --> 04:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
for other highways in the state um and
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
does it cover all the expenses of the
 
04:47:30.430 --> 04:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
turnpike system it does cover all the
 
04:47:32.350 --> 04:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
expenses of the turnpike system and when
 
04:47:33.390 --> 04:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
was the last time the tolls were
 
04:47:34.868 --> 04:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
increased the last time the tolls were
 
04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
increased were were in
 
04:47:41.070 --> 04:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
2009 so and what is the current toll it
 
04:47:44.230 --> 04:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
by Plaza yeah I know but so give me some
 
04:47:47.390 --> 04:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
samples it's generally a dollar yeah 75
 
04:47:50.190 --> 04:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
cents I think on the Spalding Turnpike
 
04:47:52.750 --> 04:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh Hampton is
 
04:47:55.708 --> 04:47:55.718 align:start position:0%
250 yeah I have to look might be yeah
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
today represent papichi I'm
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman I'm gonna
 
04:48:05.590 --> 04:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
piggy back on this fun toll discussion
 
04:48:07.990 --> 04:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
for a slightly different question which
 
04:48:10.548 --> 04:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
is not quite budget but uh it's closing
 
04:48:10.558 --> 04:48:11.590 align:start position:0%
is not quite budget but uh it's closing
out

04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
there have been bills last term
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
introduced to get rid of the front
 
04:48:16.750 --> 04:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
license plates and the major opposition
 
04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
was that we would lose toll Revenue
 
04:48:21.190 --> 04:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
because our license readers that the
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
tolls are for the front plate now the
 
04:48:25.390 --> 04:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
tolls are
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
self-funded could you guys as part of
 
04:48:29.948 --> 04:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
the budget process provide an estimate
 
04:48:32.548 --> 04:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
of how much of a toll increase how many
 
04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
cents would we need to increase the
 
04:48:36.510 --> 04:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
tolls if we wanted to pay for whatever
 
04:48:40.470 --> 04:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
it costs to avoid the need to have front
 
04:48:42.430 --> 04:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
l plate readers read them from the back
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
or use whatever other mechanism the
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
state has or maybe just an analysis of
 
04:48:49.390 --> 04:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
the revenue that we would lose to people
 
04:48:51.390 --> 04:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
who don't have front place because we
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
already have cars from out of state that
 
04:48:54.788 --> 04:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
pass through that sure now I don't want
 
04:48:56.190 --> 04:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
to make this into a big policy
 
04:48:58.830 --> 04:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
discussion but I would really appreciate
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
some insight as part of the budget
 
04:49:03.830 --> 04:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
process of how can we we remove that
 
04:49:05.750 --> 04:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
very bluntly to a lot of people an
 
04:49:07.510 --> 04:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
knowing requirement of having a front
 
04:49:09.150 --> 04:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
license plate that does not seem to be
 
04:49:11.470 --> 04:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
really needed for safety but for this
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue MH I mean even on my car I had
 
04:49:18.230 --> 04:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
to have you know it's a poor Mazda 3 and
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
the front bumper did not have a place of
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
to put a license plate so you drill
 
04:49:24.548 --> 04:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
holes through a tiny plastic bumper it's
 
04:49:26.110 --> 04:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a ridiculous thing we're
 
04:49:28.270 --> 04:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
doing and I do want to be differential
 
04:49:31.230 --> 04:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
to the needs of the turnpike system and
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't put an undue
 
04:49:36.070 --> 04:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
burden on them but it's not the big
 
04:49:39.708 --> 04:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
priority in any way sure but I'm I'm
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
done I just wanted to share that thought
 
04:49:43.310 --> 04:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
and say that I would appreciate any
 
04:49:45.070 --> 04:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
feedback you could give on us if it's at
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
all possible because it's a tiny little
 
04:49:51.788 --> 04:49:51.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
you let me let him respond and then it's
 
04:49:58.110 --> 04:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
in line
 
04:49:58.120 --> 04:49:59.750 align:start position:0%
in line
ex

04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
ex
 
04:50:02.788 --> 04:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
okay um many of my constituents have
 
04:50:04.670 --> 04:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
foreign cars and a lot of the cars that
 
04:50:07.070 --> 04:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
are being made now don't have a place
 
04:50:09.868 --> 04:50:09.878 align:start position:0%
for this plate and so as he's talking
 
04:50:11.830 --> 04:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
about they have to drill holes in which
 
04:50:13.788 --> 04:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
they don't want to drill in $100,000
 
04:50:15.628 --> 04:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
cars so I just thought share that with
 
04:50:15.638 --> 04:50:17.510 align:start position:0%
cars so I just thought share that with
you

04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:50:21.070 --> 04:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah um I know we testified against
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
it we had raised the concern I don't
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
think it was defeated or wasn't
 
04:50:27.910 --> 04:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
supported primarily because of that I
 
04:50:30.990 --> 04:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
think law enforcement had other other um
 
04:50:35.788 --> 04:50:35.798 align:start position:0%
uh concerns as well too uh it is not a I
 
04:50:37.830 --> 04:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
I believe and I'm sure we did a fiscal
 
04:50:40.270 --> 04:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
note I'm sure we did a fiscal impact I I
 
04:50:42.788 --> 04:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
I don't I think it was a substantial
 
04:50:44.670 --> 04:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
amount of of Revenue I think the point
 
04:50:48.590 --> 04:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
we made is we use not just the front
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
plate we we
 
04:50:53.548 --> 04:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
take we we take pictures of of of of of
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
both and sometimes the back is obscured
 
04:50:57.788 --> 04:50:57.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes the front in is obscured
 
04:50:59.390 --> 04:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes a vehicle is pulling a trailer
 
04:51:01.190 --> 04:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
and you can't see the back backl so we
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
use it it does it does help us with that
 
04:51:06.788 --> 04:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a very a relatively uh
 
04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
small um part but we can get you that
 
04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
information as far as I'm I'm going to
 
04:51:13.390 --> 04:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
lead this into another question as far
 
04:51:15.470 --> 04:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
as what you said about can we look at
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
rates and stuff like that one of the
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
things getting back to Chairman or if
 
04:51:22.548 --> 04:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
your your question is it is the
 
04:51:25.708 --> 04:51:25.718 align:start position:0%
turnpike uh paying for itself so the
 
04:51:28.948 --> 04:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
middle of that um slide there um talks
 
04:51:32.350 --> 04:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
about the T Pike toll Revenue pays for
 
04:51:35.110 --> 04:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
and um and it's kind of set up in that
 
04:51:37.830 --> 04:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
in that um order of priority so we first
 
04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
and for we we first have to use the uh
 
04:51:42.628 --> 04:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
the turnpike toll Revenue to pay the
 
04:51:44.788 --> 04:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
debt service pay the do Bond Bond
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
holders for past debts we have to pay
 
04:51:49.070 --> 04:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
for the operating and maintenance cost
 
04:51:51.030 --> 04:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
we have to pay for the RNR work which is
 
04:51:55.230 --> 04:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
the general upkeep uh routine Paving um
 
04:51:58.230 --> 04:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
keeping things in good working order RNR
 
04:52:00.350 --> 04:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
stands for rehabilitation and
 
04:52:02.548 --> 04:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
restoration and after all of that is
 
04:52:05.230 --> 04:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
done and paid for do we put Turnpike
 
04:52:07.390 --> 04:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue into Capital Improvement
 
04:52:10.830 --> 04:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
projects and um I I'm going to picky
 
04:52:12.510 --> 04:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
back on what you said about about rates
 
04:52:14.190 --> 04:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
and stuff because coming up in the next
 
04:52:16.670 --> 04:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
10-year plan we have had
 
04:52:19.590 --> 04:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
Turnpike um Turnpike Revenue well let me
 
04:52:21.628 --> 04:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
put it this way inflation operating
 
04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
costs everything has been going up
 
04:52:27.548 --> 04:52:27.558 align:start position:0%
Turnpike toll revenue is moderately up
 
04:52:29.948 --> 04:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
but it hasn't kept pace with with
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
inflation and some of those other cost
 
04:52:38.230 --> 04:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
um um cost drivers at the result of that
 
04:52:40.590 --> 04:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvement projects continue to
 
04:52:44.190 --> 04:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
get pushed out and um we have several in
 
04:52:48.110 --> 04:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan several um substantial
 
04:52:52.030 --> 04:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
capital projects that uh are are are not
 
04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
being able to be funded expansion of uh
 
04:52:57.190 --> 04:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
i93 and uh through bow and conquered
 
04:53:00.270 --> 04:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
here uh reconstruction of exit six and
 
04:53:02.708 --> 04:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
seven in the Manchester area are a
 
04:53:05.628 --> 04:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
couple of the major um capital projects
 
04:53:07.590 --> 04:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
so with that you know through the
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
10-year plan process we can be looking
 
04:53:11.868 --> 04:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
at you know these cop capital projects
 
04:53:14.670 --> 04:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
if they are needed if they needed and if
 
04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're desired this is what they cost
 
04:53:19.470 --> 04:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
this is what it would take to to fund
 
04:53:22.310 --> 04:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
them um and see if there is support for
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
a toll increase to support those if not
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
if there isn't the appetite for those we
 
04:53:28.830 --> 04:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
will continue to pay the debt service
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
operate and maintain and keep the system
 
04:53:32.708 --> 04:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
up but the capital projects won't be
 
04:53:34.270 --> 04:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
able to be funded so I know you've been
 
04:53:35.510 --> 04:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
doing that next year for sure but could
 
04:53:37.868 --> 04:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
you provide us with a list of those so
 
04:53:39.830 --> 04:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
the immediate Pro not immediate but the
 
04:53:41.230 --> 04:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
the first project that you would pick
 
04:53:43.708 --> 04:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
off that are being pushed out yes
 
04:53:46.070 --> 04:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
represent Murray thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:53:47.868 --> 04:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
since we're on tolls didn't correct me
 
04:53:50.310 --> 04:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong didn't the Bedford toll go
 
04:53:52.708 --> 04:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
away no no Bedford is still there
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
because they was trying they were hoping
 
04:53:55.470 --> 04:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
it would go we just we just let a
 
04:53:58.750 --> 04:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
contract to um again that's an old the
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
to Plaza that needed some uh uh
 
04:54:03.868 --> 04:54:03.878 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation work and through through
 
04:54:05.430 --> 04:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
the process what it's going to be
 
04:54:07.628 --> 04:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
converted to all electronic tolling so
 
04:54:10.628 --> 04:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
the to very similar to like in the uh uh
 
04:54:12.670 --> 04:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
in the Sea Coast with uh or in
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where most of the Mass
 
04:54:16.470 --> 04:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
Turnpike has been converted to all
 
04:54:18.590 --> 04:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
electronic tolling uh there won't be a
 
04:54:21.670 --> 04:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
toll plaza where you can um pay cash it
 
04:54:25.150 --> 04:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
will all be um um all electronic tolling
 
04:54:27.430 --> 04:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
with with a Gantry um you can either pay
 
04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
by plate or or pay by Easy Pass I just
 
04:54:31.390 --> 04:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
remember there was a I think it was a
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
Senate bill to make that toll plaza go
 
04:54:35.430 --> 04:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
away Bedford people
 
04:54:38.270 --> 04:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
didn't marac went away marac went away
 
04:54:41.110 --> 04:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
marac have been eliminated okay do you
 
04:54:43.150 --> 04:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
know what that cost you to lose that
 
04:54:44.750 --> 04:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
toll revenue or did you just add it on
 
04:54:45.750 --> 04:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
to the other
 
04:54:48.708 --> 04:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
tolls I I do we have it I don't know it
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but
 
04:54:51.040 --> 04:54:54.230 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but
yeah

04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's the that's the turnike
 
04:54:59.910 --> 04:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
system again it is a the the funding is
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
shown in there but it is an Enterprise
 
04:55:04.590 --> 04:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
System we have um um and and that
 
04:55:05.948 --> 04:55:05.958 align:start position:0%
funding can't be used for other other
 
04:55:05.958 --> 04:55:07.430 align:start position:0%
funding can't be used for other other
needs

04:55:07.430 --> 04:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:55:10.510 --> 04:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
so a representative Papi thank thank you
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
and just to make sure I understand
 
04:55:16.708 --> 04:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
correctly the revenue is not limited
 
04:55:18.670 --> 04:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
within the turnpike system you know it's
 
04:55:20.670 --> 04:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
not assigned to this part or that part
 
04:55:22.110 --> 04:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
whatever Revenue you get from anywhere
 
04:55:24.030 --> 04:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
you can use in any other corner but it
 
04:55:25.750 --> 04:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
is limited to the turn bike system
 
04:55:27.430 --> 04:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
itself that's exactly right thank you
 
04:55:28.990 --> 04:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
just making sure I understand correctly
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it
 
04:55:34.470 --> 04:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
yeah um the the final few slides are
 
04:55:35.948 --> 04:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
kind of a general overview of the
 
04:55:38.470 --> 04:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
highway fund uh we had some of the talk
 
04:55:41.350 --> 04:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
about that before um Highway fund
 
04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
revenue is unrestricted Revenue uh and
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
again that's a primary source of funding
 
04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
for Dot's operations and maintenance um
 
04:55:52.590 --> 04:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
and and and like I said I've uh
 
04:55:54.830 --> 04:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
emphasized that that uh operations and
 
04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance are typically generally not
 
04:55:59.868 --> 04:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal funding so um
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
operations and maintenance uh for the
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
for that Operations Division within the
 
04:56:09.030 --> 04:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
department it consists of about 965
 
04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
positions um and those are the folks
 
04:56:13.788 --> 04:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for the Highway
 
04:56:16.350 --> 04:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
Maintenance um plowing all the roads
 
04:56:18.628 --> 04:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
keeping uh keeping the upkeep of those
 
04:56:21.948 --> 04:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
roads um we are Statewide in the Highway
 
04:56:24.430 --> 04:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
Maintenance we have six districts
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
regionally throughout the state and
 
04:56:31.150 --> 04:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
about 87 Patrol sheds so um facilities
 
04:56:34.628 --> 04:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh ac across the state um Bridge
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance traffic Mechanical Services
 
04:56:40.548 --> 04:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
that supports the fleet um folks may not
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
know that that that the dot maintains
 
04:56:48.868 --> 04:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
the state fuel distribution um uh system
 
04:56:52.030 --> 04:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
um and also our transportation systems
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
and management uh Transportation Systems
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
management operations that's the
 
04:56:59.910 --> 04:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
transportation management center um
 
04:57:02.350 --> 04:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
which which monitors the um traffic and
 
04:57:05.150 --> 04:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
utilization of the system so that's a
 
04:57:07.990 --> 04:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
very uh broad overview of of of
 
04:57:10.350 --> 04:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
operations but all of that what they're
 
04:57:13.150 --> 04:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
um responsible for on the following
 
04:57:15.548 --> 04:57:15.558 align:start position:0%
slide is a general you know kind of some
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the summary about the highway fund
 
04:57:20.190 --> 04:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue overview and as we said at the
 
04:57:22.150 --> 04:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
beginning when you asked the question we
 
04:57:24.628 --> 04:57:24.638 align:start position:0%
you know the dot is not um is not the
 
04:57:26.270 --> 04:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
highway fund and the highway fund is not
 
04:57:29.830 --> 04:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
the dot it's the um Highway fund revenu
 
04:57:33.548 --> 04:57:33.558 align:start position:0%
is generated from from from gas tax road
 
04:57:36.590 --> 04:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
toll and and registration fees um it's
 
04:57:40.230 --> 04:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
collected by the um Department of Safety
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it's attrib it's appropriated out to
 
04:57:45.910 --> 04:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
the various um uses um the current road
 
04:57:49.030 --> 04:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
toll the current gas tax is about 22.2
 
04:57:52.350 --> 04:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
cents about 13.2 of that cents falls
 
04:57:54.910 --> 04:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
into the unrestricted Revenue bucket the
 
04:57:58.350 --> 04:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
other um uses are restricted to as I
 
04:58:00.590 --> 04:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
said the municipal block grant Aid the
 
04:58:02.948 --> 04:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
betterment program and the 4.2 cents
 
04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
that goes toward um paying off
 
04:58:09.548 --> 04:58:09.558 align:start position:0%
i93 um and of the motor vehicle fees
 
04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
again 12 12% of that uh goes to uh
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal Aid and uh the remainder flows
 
04:58:20.948 --> 04:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
into the uh unrestricted Highway fund um
 
04:58:23.110 --> 04:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me represent
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
papichi Mr chair I I hope I didn't jump
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
the gun a bit early but sure I just
 
04:58:30.310 --> 04:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure at some point on
 
04:58:32.510 --> 04:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
this slide you'll offer some thoughts on
 
04:58:34.990 --> 04:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
the impact of the increase in electric
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh registered on the highway
 
04:58:40.708 --> 04:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
find and all that sorry if I uh came in
 
04:58:42.510 --> 04:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
too early and I stole the Thunder but I
 
04:58:43.830 --> 04:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
really want to make sure it's covered
 
04:58:45.948 --> 04:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll get through it real quick
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
for for reference of the committee the
 
04:58:50.310 --> 04:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
the the split and the draw of of the
 
04:58:52.948 --> 04:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
highway fund usage by the agencies is
 
04:58:56.910 --> 04:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
laid out there so about 73% of uh and
 
04:58:59.990 --> 04:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is governed by RSA as well too um
 
04:59:05.590 --> 04:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
by RSA um do um draws about 73% of the
 
04:59:08.230 --> 04:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
highway fund and that includes the 12%
 
04:59:11.590 --> 04:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
that we distribute to um um cities and
 
04:59:15.510 --> 04:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
towns and about 26% of the highway fund
 
04:59:18.750 --> 04:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue goes to Department of Safety and
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
a small percentage 1% goes to other
 
04:59:23.310 --> 04:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
agencies so that's that's the split and
 
04:59:25.628 --> 04:59:25.638 align:start position:0%
the breakdown
 
04:59:28.350 --> 04:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
um with with respect to your your
 
04:59:30.628 --> 04:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
question due to um and and there's a
 
04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
little block there on the side where we
 
04:59:35.470 --> 04:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
reference that um essentially Highway
 
04:59:37.470 --> 04:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
fund revenue for the last couple of
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
years in in this bium is is flat is
 
04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
projected to be um flat um and over the
 
04:59:48.590 --> 04:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
long term increases in fuel efficiency
 
04:59:51.948 --> 04:59:51.958 align:start position:0%
increases in um electric vehicles uh
 
04:59:54.868 --> 04:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
things like that um will have a slow
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
incrementals projected to have a slow
 
04:59:59.868 --> 04:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
incremental decline of the overall uh
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue into the highway fund
 
05:00:04.948 --> 05:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
historically fuel efficiency and things
 
05:00:07.470 --> 05:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
have have been made up by ever
 
05:00:11.070 --> 05:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
increasing um volumes of of of traffic
 
05:00:13.708 --> 05:00:13.718 align:start position:0%
that that VMT figure that vehicle miles
 
05:00:17.628 --> 05:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
traveled um but um uh you know through
 
05:00:20.430 --> 05:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
the 80s and 90s that that type of
 
05:00:23.628 --> 05:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
continued growth has very much leveled
 
05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
off in terms of and particularly in the
 
05:00:29.830 --> 05:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast that um um growth of
 
05:00:32.270 --> 05:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
traffic volumes and and new drivers and
 
05:00:36.310 --> 05:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
stuff has has slowed and uh longterm as
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the highway fund is
 
05:00:41.430 --> 05:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
incrementally projected to um decline
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
based on uh increasing fuel efficiency
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
less travel and electric vehicles um and
 
05:00:51.430 --> 05:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
we have had for a number of years you
 
05:00:53.910 --> 05:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
know what we see is a structural deficit
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
in the in the highway fund the highway
 
05:00:58.830 --> 05:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
fund Revenue has not been able to keep
 
05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
up with um um operations and maintenance
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
costs from both us and the department of
 
05:01:06.390 --> 05:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
safety so there have been a number of
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
one-time fixes over the past decade to
 
05:01:12.990 --> 05:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
um help bail out the highway fund there
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
have been registration fee sir charges
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
um we had transferred some assets from
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
the from the turnpike system to the I
 
05:01:23.788 --> 05:01:23.798 align:start position:0%
mean from the from the highway fund to
 
05:01:26.830 --> 05:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system and used Turnpike
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know Revenue to buy those assets and
 
05:01:33.230 --> 05:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
and and and help um um augment the
 
05:01:35.510 --> 05:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
highway Fund in the last several years
 
05:01:38.310 --> 05:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
there have been a number of um general
 
05:01:41.430 --> 05:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
fund infusions into the um into the
 
05:01:43.548 --> 05:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
highway fund to make to to make things
 
05:01:46.788 --> 05:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
balanced so um again long-term stability
 
05:01:50.788 --> 05:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
is one of those um one of one of those
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
05:01:51.920 --> 05:01:54.150 align:start position:0%
issues and
concerns

05:01:54.150 --> 05:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:01:57.470 --> 05:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
um so that's a very highlevel brief
 
05:02:00.270 --> 05:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
overview of the of the highway fund and
 
05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
how it's utilized in the department and
 
05:02:05.830 --> 05:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
that really comes to the uh end of end
 
05:02:08.150 --> 05:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
of my presentation and if there are any
 
05:02:10.750 --> 05:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
further questions we do have a a a chart
 
05:02:13.110 --> 05:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
there um it kind it kind of talks about
 
05:02:15.548 --> 05:02:15.558 align:start position:0%
but it shows the tradition it shows the
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
historical um Revenue history of of the
 
05:02:21.910 --> 05:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
highway fund there for your reference
 
05:02:24.590 --> 05:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
and um just my very last slide a couple
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the uh issues and challenges that
 
05:02:29.670 --> 05:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
that we continue to work through I I
 
05:02:31.788 --> 05:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know the workforce and the
 
05:02:33.510 --> 05:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
vacancies we had a good discussion on
 
05:02:37.628 --> 05:02:37.638 align:start position:0%
that um inflationary cost impacts are uh
 
05:02:39.230 --> 05:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
affecting not just us but I think all
 
05:02:41.390 --> 05:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
state a agencies and and and all
 
05:02:45.948 --> 05:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
households as well too um one of the um
 
05:02:47.830 --> 05:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things I like to point out
 
05:02:49.030 --> 05:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
though is you know some of those
 
05:02:49.040 --> 05:02:50.150 align:start position:0%
though is you know some of those
Workforce

05:02:50.150 --> 05:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
05:02:52.990 --> 05:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
vacancies uh and things do affect our
 
05:02:56.590 --> 05:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
productivity um we are uh falling short
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
of targets that we would like to meet as
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
we prioritize resources to critical
 
05:03:03.750 --> 05:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
areas uh we
 
05:03:09.510 --> 05:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
prioritize um life safety um um efforts
 
05:03:12.670 --> 05:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes at the expense of other
 
05:03:14.628 --> 05:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
um maintenance needs particularly
 
05:03:17.230 --> 05:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance needs and that
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
can you know there somewhere down the
 
05:03:22.230 --> 05:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
road those those um um preventative
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance the the lack of investment
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
of preventative maintenance you know
 
05:03:29.548 --> 05:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
will will come due but um I like to say
 
05:03:32.350 --> 05:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
that uh in and when we get to our budget
 
05:03:34.270 --> 05:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
you'll probably hear me say it again we
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
are doing what we what we need to do
 
05:03:38.030 --> 05:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
we're not getting done all that we would
 
05:03:39.510 --> 05:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
like to do or feel that we should be
 
05:03:39.520 --> 05:03:40.590 align:start position:0%
like to do or feel that we should be
doing

05:03:40.590 --> 05:03:40.600 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
but um we are getting done um what we
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
have to get done
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
so to the extent there any dedicated
 
05:03:48.548 --> 05:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
funds beyond the big ones you talked
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
about here could you just get a list of
 
05:03:53.110 --> 05:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
those too Mr Len and all you know
 
05:03:54.910 --> 05:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
revenues coming in and the expenses
 
05:03:56.430 --> 05:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
going out kind of thing sure do you know
 
05:03:56.440 --> 05:03:57.390 align:start position:0%
going out kind of thing sure do you know
what

05:03:57.390 --> 05:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:04:00.990 --> 05:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
um representative um public I just want
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understood your question
 
05:04:04.548 --> 05:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
other so you got the highway fund you
 
05:04:06.670 --> 05:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
talked about the ter pay fund um
 
05:04:07.750 --> 05:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety had a whole bunch
 
05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
of dedicated funds I don't know what the
 
05:04:10.270 --> 05:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
situation is with with you all do you
 
05:04:12.670 --> 05:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
have other smaller dedicated funds so
 
05:04:14.470 --> 05:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
just a listing of the smaller dedicated
 
05:04:16.750 --> 05:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
funds and what revenues flow into them
 
05:04:19.628 --> 05:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
What expenses fall out of them what rsas
 
05:04:21.628 --> 05:04:21.638 align:start position:0%
control them certainly right
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative Pap thank you Mr chair
 
05:04:25.750 --> 05:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
and just to build on my last question
 
05:04:27.910 --> 05:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
about the uh you know structural deficit
 
05:04:30.350 --> 05:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
in the highway
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
fund whether you have an answer on this
 
05:04:34.830 --> 05:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
right now or you answer later I'm happy
 
05:04:38.190 --> 05:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
either way but in your opinion if we
 
05:04:40.788 --> 05:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
look at it in terms of you know uh
 
05:04:43.310 --> 05:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue per mile driven or per pound
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
mile driven whatever is the appropriate
 
05:04:47.788 --> 05:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
measure do you feel that at this point
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
in time we are capturing revenue from
 
05:04:52.670 --> 05:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
gas vehicles versus you know internal
 
05:04:54.430 --> 05:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
combustion engine Vehicles versus
 
05:04:56.910 --> 05:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles are those revenues
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
comparable or is one class of vehicles
 
05:05:02.948 --> 05:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
paying more of a burden in the road tax
 
05:05:04.948 --> 05:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
than the other as far as you can tell
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
and you know I would appreciate any
 
05:05:09.030 --> 05:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
insight now or later yep I will I will
 
05:05:11.110 --> 05:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
check I I don't have the numbers I know
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
last uh session maybe session before
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
last there was a um there was a
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
registration fee premium placed on EVs
 
05:05:22.948 --> 05:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
and and hybrids um I've seen some of the
 
05:05:24.430 --> 05:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
reports from the Department of Safety
 
05:05:26.910 --> 05:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's generated a think around $2
 
05:05:28.590 --> 05:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
million of of
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue I I know in the past we have
 
05:05:33.510 --> 05:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
done studies and and representative M
 
05:05:38.070 --> 05:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
nor Maes has had um um bills on a road
 
05:05:40.230 --> 05:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
user fee where we had a lot of data that
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
that that compared what a fair share was
 
05:05:45.910 --> 05:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know right off the bat how that
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh present um fee structure represents
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
to a fair share but we can but I can
 
05:05:52.590 --> 05:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
check and we'll get you something thank
 
05:05:55.070 --> 05:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
you I understand it's not a simple
 
05:05:56.990 --> 05:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
question yeah that's why I'm asking it
 
05:05:59.628 --> 05:05:59.638 align:start position:0%
very early so you have plenty of time to
 
05:06:01.708 --> 05:06:01.718 align:start position:0%
uh you know get the best data available
 
05:06:04.270 --> 05:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you appreciate that thank you
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you I have a
 
05:06:06.878 --> 05:06:07.990 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you I have a
couple

05:06:07.990 --> 05:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
couple
 
05:06:09.990 --> 05:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
questions you answered the bunch of them
 
05:06:12.510 --> 05:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
already so thank you for that um some
 
05:06:14.110 --> 05:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
years ago you were really struggling
 
05:06:17.948 --> 05:06:17.958 align:start position:0%
with um repairs of plows and trucks and
 
05:06:19.868 --> 05:06:19.878 align:start position:0%
stuff and they're I remember in pretty
 
05:06:21.868 --> 05:06:21.878 align:start position:0%
frightening shape uh we worked really
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
hard to try to get you back on track to
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
purchasing new vehicles um even though
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
we don't know where we're going from
 
05:06:30.070 --> 05:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
here um you know we're all facing some
 
05:06:31.470 --> 05:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
difficulties with the revenues and the
 
05:06:33.910 --> 05:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
budget um but to a certain extent can
 
05:06:36.390 --> 05:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
you speak to are you on track now in
 
05:06:38.910 --> 05:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
terms of Maintenance and um purchasing
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
of new materials for your plows and
 
05:06:43.628 --> 05:06:43.638 align:start position:0%
trucks and all those things I would say
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
generally yes we have I I we have had
 
05:06:48.910 --> 05:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
that has been a focus area and some past
 
05:06:51.310 --> 05:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
budgets and we've put some um Capital
 
05:06:53.948 --> 05:06:53.958 align:start position:0%
funds and and and others in in there and
 
05:06:59.670 --> 05:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
in the our last budget that um
 
05:07:03.548 --> 05:07:03.558 align:start position:0%
um uh Fleet investment cycle was was
 
05:07:06.030 --> 05:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
recognized and more or less fully funded
 
05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
so I think we are on a on a on a on a
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
good track there of keeping up we have
 
05:07:15.510 --> 05:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
been hampered more by supply chain
 
05:07:17.868 --> 05:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
issues than than actual funding issues
 
05:07:20.030 --> 05:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
we've had we've had money and and
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
purchase orders and stuff out there that
 
05:07:25.110 --> 05:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
that uh dealers and suppliers couldn't
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't meet with uh you know some of
 
05:07:29.230 --> 05:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
the issues in the past years with with
 
05:07:34.548 --> 05:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
that but um it will be a um it will be a
 
05:07:36.150 --> 05:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
point of discussion in our upcoming
 
05:07:37.708 --> 05:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
budget whether we can sustain that
 
05:07:40.270 --> 05:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
recommended investment um
 
05:07:42.430 --> 05:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
um replacement cycle for the for the
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
fleet I'm glad to hear you know where
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
you are for now um last year or last
 
05:07:50.230 --> 05:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
budget cycle uh there was a line in the
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
budget pertaining to um public
 
05:07:54.830 --> 05:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
transportation affecting Upper Valley
 
05:07:59.310 --> 05:07:59.320 align:start position:0%
nashwa the Sea Coast trans yeah Transit
 
05:08:01.628 --> 05:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
um that apparently did not make it into
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
the efficiency budget can you speak to
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
that is it in a priority budget or what
 
05:08:08.350 --> 05:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
happened to um that line to that that
 
05:08:11.310 --> 05:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
funding I I think we had talked about a
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
little bit with the with the with the
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
transit match when we were on the bureau
 
05:08:17.230 --> 05:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
uh division of Aeronautics Rail and
 
05:08:19.030 --> 05:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
Transit and the match requirement so the
 
05:08:21.350 --> 05:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
state has had
 
05:08:24.788 --> 05:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
historically um put very little to help
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
and assist um um local Transit agencies
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
with the operating match um some nominal
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
amount of about $200,000 a year which
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
was an un budget last last year last
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
budget session with um um um lobbying
 
05:08:44.430 --> 05:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
from from the transit interest support
 
05:08:47.230 --> 05:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
from the Department as well as
 
05:08:50.350 --> 05:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
recognition that um there had been
 
05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
additional investment there had been
 
05:08:55.110 --> 05:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
additional um federal funds through FTA
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the on the on the federal funding
 
05:09:00.868 --> 05:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
side that warranted uh you know some
 
05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
consideration of additional State
 
05:09:06.190 --> 05:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
assistance for the state match um under
 
05:09:10.830 --> 05:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 um they infused about one point in
 
05:09:12.628 --> 05:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
in the banum I think it's about $1.9
 
05:09:18.110 --> 05:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
million of of General funds to um um
 
05:09:20.310 --> 05:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
augment or or to go to local trans to
 
05:09:23.350 --> 05:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
assist with local Transit match this
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
budget I I and the only reason I point
 
05:09:27.548 --> 05:09:27.558 align:start position:0%
that out that it came from it was never
 
05:09:29.310 --> 05:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
it never came through our budget so when
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
we started our budget this year basing
 
05:09:35.070 --> 05:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
against the adjusted authorized you know
 
05:09:38.548 --> 05:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
we did not have a um uh that that wasn't
 
05:09:40.948 --> 05:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
reflected in our in our budget so when
 
05:09:45.230 --> 05:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
we were given you know um relatively uh
 
05:09:47.708 --> 05:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
level budget targets it wasn't able to
 
05:09:50.990 --> 05:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
be accommodated within our budget but
 
05:09:53.910 --> 05:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um can you speak to your
 
05:09:55.110 --> 05:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
collaboration with department
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
environmental services around Coastal
 
05:09:58.868 --> 05:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
resilience because that's cost everybody
 
05:10:00.708 --> 05:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in terms of storm damage
 
05:10:00.718 --> 05:10:01.910 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in terms of storm damage
and

05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:01.920 --> 05:10:04.750 align:start position:0%
and
repairs

05:10:04.750 --> 05:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
05:10:07.990 --> 05:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
um in in general I mean I think in
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
general we work very closely with with
 
05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services the
 
05:10:15.470 --> 05:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh Coastal risks and Hazard committee uh
 
05:10:17.548 --> 05:10:17.558 align:start position:0%
commission that that was established by
 
05:10:19.310 --> 05:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
legislature and has done a lot of work
 
05:10:22.190 --> 05:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
on sea level change and stuff we sit on
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
that commission along with with da Dees
 
05:10:28.510 --> 05:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
we utilize that uh scientific data and
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
that information in all of our project
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
planning um when we when we had we we're
 
05:10:36.788 --> 05:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
doing a major Bridge Project over uh
 
05:10:40.590 --> 05:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
over Hampton Harbor and part of the um
 
05:10:42.990 --> 05:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
um setting of The elevations of the
 
05:10:44.548 --> 05:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
peers and the abutments and the height
 
05:10:46.830 --> 05:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
of the bridge were were were based on
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
the coastal risks and Hazard commissions
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
um recommended um planning sea level
 
05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
elevations and things like that so um
 
05:10:58.948 --> 05:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
permitting wise we we coordinate closely
 
05:11:02.750 --> 05:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
with with uh Dees um we meet regularly
 
05:11:05.548 --> 05:11:05.558 align:start position:0%
we have quarterly um executive office
 
05:11:07.230 --> 05:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
meeting to make sure that things are
 
05:11:09.948 --> 05:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
being coordinated um I I know that's
 
05:11:11.670 --> 05:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
what you're getting at but I think I'm
 
05:11:14.150 --> 05:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'm more concerned of when there's an
 
05:11:16.190 --> 05:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
extreme weather event that causes damage
 
05:11:18.190 --> 05:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
how does that throw off your budget what
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
does that do to you
 
05:11:21.600 --> 05:11:26.030 align:start position:0%
does that do to you
financially

05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah uh depending on the on the on
 
05:11:31.310 --> 05:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
the size and scope so the the LA last
 
05:11:33.750 --> 05:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
winter we had a a lot of damage along
 
05:11:35.470 --> 05:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
the along the seaw wall along the
 
05:11:39.628 --> 05:11:39.638 align:start position:0%
revetments along um 1A along along code
 
05:11:45.310 --> 05:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
so we have um we have um um put State
 
05:11:48.110 --> 05:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
forces State funds into repairing those
 
05:11:51.070 --> 05:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
um there are longer term um repairs that
 
05:11:55.310 --> 05:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
are needed we are pursuing um um thema
 
05:11:57.548 --> 05:11:57.558 align:start position:0%
eligible Grant activity we did just get
 
05:12:02.548 --> 05:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
a uh last spring we got a um $20 million
 
05:12:06.628 --> 05:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
um Federal Highway Grant to support the
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
um rebuilding of those revetments but it
 
05:12:11.548 --> 05:12:11.558 align:start position:0%
is an ongoing if if you've been out
 
05:12:13.548 --> 05:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
there we've had we've had State forces
 
05:12:16.590 --> 05:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
and contractors continuing all all
 
05:12:20.430 --> 05:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
summer and all all this past winter um
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
at least rebuilding to the existing
 
05:12:28.390 --> 05:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
levels um you know and uh uh Shoring up
 
05:12:31.390 --> 05:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
the the sea defenses so it's been it is
 
05:12:33.910 --> 05:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
an it is an unbudgeted impact that we
 
05:12:37.868 --> 05:12:37.878 align:start position:0%
have to um absorb we seek to defay those
 
05:12:41.070 --> 05:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
costs through um through FEMA or other
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
emergency relief funds but um we carry
 
05:12:46.910 --> 05:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
those do you have anything more so if
 
05:12:49.948 --> 05:12:49.958 align:start position:0%
there is a declaration then we can go uh
 
05:12:53.708 --> 05:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
with FEMA funds or also um fhwa
 
05:12:55.750 --> 05:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
emergency relief funds so those are
 
05:12:59.310 --> 05:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
options um the timing of the funding is
 
05:13:01.070 --> 05:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
interesting because it will take some
 
05:13:03.230 --> 05:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
time to get those funds in the meantime
 
05:13:06.230 --> 05:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
we do the work um and and use State
 
05:13:08.110 --> 05:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
funds in the
 
05:13:10.708 --> 05:13:10.718 align:start position:0%
meantime for I guess perhaps the future
 
05:13:13.350 --> 05:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
I've been curious if we did not rely on
 
05:13:15.708 --> 05:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
the tax credit for these match how much
 
05:13:17.750 --> 05:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
more could we do um I don't know if you
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
can come up with a scenario or a
 
05:13:21.390 --> 05:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
narrative to say you know if we didn't
 
05:13:23.310 --> 05:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
rely on this so that we end up with you
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
know less impact of the money um what
 
05:13:27.708 --> 05:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
else how much more could we have done
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
but I expect you know if you can come
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
back with that if that's sort of a
 
05:13:32.430 --> 05:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
future question if that's not easy for
 
05:13:34.150 --> 05:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
you to address some of I have some of
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
that so I can tell you that I can tell
 
05:13:37.948 --> 05:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
you what we've earned and what we we
 
05:13:39.910 --> 05:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
generally use and it's usually a one for
 
05:13:44.110 --> 05:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
one and so we use approximately in in 24
 
05:13:47.910 --> 05:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
we used 58 million um toll credits so
 
05:13:49.270 --> 05:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
that's 58
 
05:13:52.110 --> 05:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
million dollar of funding that that
 
05:14:06.070 --> 05:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:08.310 --> 05:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I hope this has been helpful I
 
05:14:09.910 --> 05:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
hope we could answer your questions I
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
know um I I know hopefully you guys took
 
05:14:13.628 --> 05:14:13.638 align:start position:0%
some notes of the questions we'll get
 
05:14:15.548 --> 05:14:15.558 align:start position:0%
the information and stuff that you
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
requested we look forward to uh further
 
05:14:19.990 --> 05:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
