Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's 1101.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.500
I will open the work session in Division 2 on House Bill 396 and recess for about 10 minutes.

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Thank you.

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.500
Thank you.

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Thank you.

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Thank you.

12
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Thank you.

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
Thank you.

14
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Thank you.

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.000
I'll reconvene the work session on House Bill 396 and open the floor to comments.

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Just in case.

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.500
In case you forget who you are.

18
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500
He's here.

19
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.000
He's wandering the hall somewhere.

20
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Okay.

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Okay.

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I think what this bill basically is, is a big oops I think there was a authorization given to execute which was not authorized by this state but committed to by this a employee of the state uh to the detriment of the local district or though to which one was it uh palmer regional center technical education does anybody have any comments one way or the other Thanks, Mr.

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Chair.

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:51.500
If I could just say that it was my general feeling after the hearing that it seemed like, you know, there was reliance whether or not it was, you know, an appropriate thing to do.

25
00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.000
But there was reliance on what the state had told in an official capacity to the center.

26
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And so they went ahead with an expense.

27
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:17.500
And so I think in law, when there is reliance, usually the court comes down on the side of the people who were wronged, who were harmed.

28
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.500
So the damages here are to the center.

29
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:39.500
And I think the only way to make this right is to make sure that it doesn't happen again in the future and to just correct, you know, to make the center whole for this mistake.

30
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.500
Mr.

31
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.500
Representative Pappapit.

32
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:57.000
I just want to echo what Representative Hacken-Phillips said, that in this case, the center seems to have made a good faith effort to obtain the approval.

33
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:10.000
There was a miscommunication for which the DOE graciously assumed the responsibility and assured us that the processes have already been changed so this wouldn't happen.

34
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So I think that honestly the only right thing to do here is to correct that consequence that you know again mistakes that were made in good faith and I would support OTPing this.

35
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I don't you't have a lot.

36
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Thank you.

37
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It's a work session.

38
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I'm on.

39
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
That's funny.

40
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.500
Half of us are on.

41
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.500
I can share my microphone if you want, but I think Mary, he just moved OTP.

42
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.500
Is that correct?

43
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500
Okay.

44
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500
Okay.

45
00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.500
Motion made and seconded for OTP recommendation for full finance on House Call 396.

46
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.000
All those in favor, raise your hand.

47
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Okay, unanimous.

48
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Anything else?

49
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.500
Now what do we do?

50
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.000
We wait for one o'clock.

51
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Go to what?

52
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Go to what?

53
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.500
I have to look at your game.

54
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500
Oh, no, no.

55
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.000
That's not until we're finishing.

56
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.500
Thank you and you want to make any comments?

57
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500
Okay, so everybody's happy.

58
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.500
Good, all right.

59
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.000
Now the joint session is at one.

60
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.500
I'll try to get in and out.

61
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.500
Thank you.

62
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.500
Thank you.

63
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.500
Thank you.

64
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.500
Thank you.

65
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.500
Thank you.
