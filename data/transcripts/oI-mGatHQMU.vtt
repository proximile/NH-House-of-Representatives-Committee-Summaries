uh thank you Mr chair good morning to
 
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 align:start position:0%
the members of uh my original committee
 
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
three terms ago
 
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 align:start position:0%
um I I'm here today uh representing
 
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 align:start position:0%

Deerfield
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
for those of you who have skimmed or
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
read House Bill 91 if you were here last
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
term this is going to seem eerily
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
familiar uh you you probably voted for
 
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 align:start position:0%
it and the half session two years ago
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
and and you may Wonder well what are we
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
doing and what we're doing is it was
 
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
such a successful Bill coming out of the
 
00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:25.450 align:start position:0%
such a successful Bill coming out of the
house

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
that in the budget negotiations it got
 
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
taken hostage and the Senate attached
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
um a spending bill that had never come
 
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
to the house and so on that committee a
 
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
conference I refused to accede to the
 
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
Senate demand and they they killed the
 
00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
hostage so so this bill is uh is is what
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
we've already seen it's actually a
 
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
little bit simpler than the last time uh
 
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
what what does it do the main main
 
00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
things it does there are three things it
 
00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.490 align:start position:0%
things it does there are three things it
establishes

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
establishes
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
at the department level a governance
 
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 align:start position:0%
board with the governance
 
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and this is standard
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
corporate behavior these days and it's
 
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
something that does not exist currently
 
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
in the department and in my six I guess
 
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
six plus years now technically
 
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
um my perception of the Departments
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
um compliance with the spirit of our
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment from 2018 the
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
one establishing a right to privacy in
 
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
our constitution is that they've been so
 
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
busy that this is a major subject area
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
that they've just not been focused on
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
and by establishing this governance
 
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
board it's meant to you know clarify
 
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
their mind gather their focus and
 
00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
provide them with some privacy expertise
 
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
to help them manage privacy issues
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
within the department
 
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.150 align:start position:0%
within the department
um

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
it implements a risk mitigation
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
technique in the corporate world they
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
call it a privacy impact assessment but
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's a risk mitigation technique and so
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
that before any I.T system gets
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
implemented there's meant to be a
 
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
thorough analysis of the processes and
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
procedures and Personnel issues around
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
that I.T system to anticipate any risks
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
to individual privacy and then to the
 
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
extent that there are are identified
 
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
risks that they then have a mitigation
 
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
plan and and so this bill basically
 
00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
requires that this risk assessment and
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan be done prior to the
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
implementation of an I.T system so that
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
we can proactively do what we can to
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
assure privacy
 
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
it establishes two classified positions
 
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
to to assist with uh you know basically
 
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
training and supporting the governance
 
00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019 align:start position:0%
effort and to handle the workload of
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
these risk mitigations
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
um one might think that
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
um the the IT staff could have people
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
already on board that could handle this
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
but this is really a I think a a new job
 
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
description for the Department in that
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
to be really good at these risk
 
00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:40.019 align:start position:0%
mitigations you have to understand I.T
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
systems you have to understand
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
workflow and process you have to
 
00:09:47.769 --> 00:09:47.779 align:start position:0%
understand you know the Privacy
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
principles and and in some cases the law
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and you need to understand
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
I.T security because all of those things
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
have to come together to really come up
 
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
with a good risk mitigation plan so so
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does what it
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't do the last time you you it
 
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.339 align:start position:0%
included something on the closed loop
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
referral system but that issue got dealt
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
with separately in the last term so it's
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
it's not in this bill I have to
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
um point out
 
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
that in the drafting I made an error I I
 
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
apparently got feedback on this that got
 
00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
by me but on so I I have to bring an
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
amendment or I don't know I'll do
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
whatever you tell me to do I can either
 
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
do the amendment or this is now your
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
bill and you can do the amendment I'm
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
willing to do my part but on page three
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
line four
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
it says uh 2023 at the end of that line
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be 2024.
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
because I think that's just a carryover
 
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
from the old bill
 
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
um and then on line 20
 
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:10.220 align:start position:0%
uh the job title uh is is not correct
 
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
instead of a business systems analyst
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
too it's an I.T manager 4 and it's a
 
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
labor grade step 30 or excuse me labor
 
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
grade 32 instead of a step five it's a
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
step seven
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't have a financial impact on
 
00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note this is just a
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
correction of the legislative language
 
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
and then on uh line 22 and 23 I repeated
 
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
the error of calling them Business
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
Systems analysts instead of the proper
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
term of it manager
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
so so I I can get that Amendment started
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
today with the with the permission of
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
the chair so that by the time you exec
 
00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
it it would be available to you for your
 
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.470 align:start position:0%
it it would be available to you for your
consideration

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
with that I'm willing to take questions
 
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
members yes sir
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
um my first question is is there a
 
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
current problem with
 
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.190 align:start position:0%
current problem with
um

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
this information being leaked are there
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
are we are we seeing lots of people
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
suffering from their information being
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
I'll let Mr wieders address that
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
um I I would be reluctant to to put on
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
the public record if we're having a lot
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
of problems in that area I I
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
being a former privacy and security guy
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's it's best not to Signal
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
That You're vulnerable because that
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
tends to attract flies
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
um what what I would say in a more
 
00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019 align:start position:0%
generic way to your question is that uh
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh the state of New Hampshire
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
established the right to privacy and in
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
the department uh I by working with them
 
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me fairly clear that uh
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
they they were not very far along on the
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
maturity cycle or maturity level of for
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
privacy operations and and and that in
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
itself is a strategic weakness that this
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill addresses
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
ask a follow-up follow-up okay
 
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
um thanks you said that you um have i t
 
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
background yourself I do and I also am a
 
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
bit of a techie nerd and um
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
I will say that one of my biggest beefs
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
with information technology
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
um operationals
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
it is it is
 
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.230 align:start position:0%
it is it is
um

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
they often use Microsoft and other
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
non-free proprietary corporate software
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh closed source and being an open
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
source free and free and open source
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
software Advocate because I understand
 
00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:11.459 align:start position:0%
it's just so much safer what are the
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
chances that these two Security
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
Professionals would actually retailer
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
the system and start using free and open
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
source software instead of Microsoft
 
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
which quite frankly is not trustworthy
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that's a fascinating
 
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
question that goes Way Beyond the the
 
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill this bill is to
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
establish a framework that does not
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
exist today and the capacity to exercise
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
within that framework the future
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
architectural design is a strategic
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
question we have the director of doit
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
here today maybe he could talk about his
 
00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:50.899 align:start position:0%
intent for the future architecture of
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire I.T systems and Mr
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
wieders from the Department of Health
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
and Human Services who's their CIO is
 
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
also here so they they'd be better in a
 
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the department there is the concern
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
and there was the concern last time
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
around of balancing the important
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns that you've recognized
 
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.210 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns that you've recognized
here

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:25.220 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
with ensuring that a vulnerable
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
population that has a hard time
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
navigating uh government government
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
systems can also receive the services
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
that they need in a timely fashion
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
is that something that has already been
 
00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:44.339 align:start position:0%
addressed with the closed loop system or
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
is that something that we need to be
 
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
sure we are balancing here
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I uh okay
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
so we we explicitly took the closed loop
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
out and and so it's a little it's
 
00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339 align:start position:0%
outside my boundaries but but since I've
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
tracked that issue as well I I am in a
 
00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
position to tell you that uh all of the
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
concerns that the legislature
 
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
communicated to the department about you
 
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
know the um and you're right there was a
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
balancing act to what extent can we
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
easily provide additional services to
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
our clients
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
um while maintaining their privacy that
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
that is a trade-off decision and
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and based on those conversations the
 
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.230 align:start position:0%
um and based on those conversations the
department

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
took their own initiative to shut down
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
the RFP that was underway for that
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
closed-loop referral system because you
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
know the perception that the RFP had not
 
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
put enough into it regarding
 
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
requirements for privacy and security so
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
they pulled that back and think I think
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
they've reissued it I don't know what
 
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
the status is but I'm sure that the
 
00:16:59.689 --> 00:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
without having read it I'm sure that the
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
requirements and the updated RFP sort of
 
00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
address that better
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you
 
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative Edward's taking the
 
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
representative Edward's taking the
question

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate place for this to be
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
housed actually in the department of
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
Information Technology versus it in the
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
department of
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
DHHS we talked about that last time on
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
the bill it just seems that we're
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
looking at privacy
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
an asylum mentality versus looking at it
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
broadly within the state itself
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
I I that's an excellent question and
 
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
um two years ago the director of the
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
commissioner of I.T made the same
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
observation and and the Committees made
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
the same question and so what my answer
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
was then is that as the chair of
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
division three as a graduate alumni of
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
hhsea you know I uh I perceived that my
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
credibility scope was within the
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.220 align:start position:0%
and given that that is probably
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
the predominant place where we handle
 
00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:15.539 align:start position:0%
personal data I thought it was
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
nevertheless a great place to get
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
started there's there's nothing
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
um in in the legislation uh that that
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the commissioner of I.T
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and begin to implement these
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
things on his own and I've I've told him
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
I'm here to support him in that regard
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
and so far the only request has been on
 
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:42.299 align:start position:0%
a separate bill to create
 
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
um of to to put into statute the role
 
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:48.539 align:start position:0%
that they created already or a chief
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
information security officer so so Mr
 
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
Goulet is I think uh on on top of that
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
this this is specifically the Department
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services because I
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
felt like that was my my boundary and my
 
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
scope and that it was probably solving
 
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the state's personal data
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
security issues
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chair
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
in saying this
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
do we actually need to have legislation
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
to mandate something I think the
 
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419 align:start position:0%
department would do anyways
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think given the level of what
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and so forth and
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
privacy being so important to those here
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
why do we need legislation to tell the
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
department to do something I think they
 
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
would do on their own
 
00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
while they could do it on their own the
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
governance board requires the active
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
participation of Department leadership
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
at a level that did not exist when this
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
bill was drafted they weren't doing it
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
and so oftentimes if we see the
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
executive branch failing to do something
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
that the legislature perceives to be
 
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:04.220 align:start position:0%
important we we codify the requirement
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
so so there's that they weren't doing it
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
there's also the authorization for two
 
00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:16.220 align:start position:0%
very specific types of people to help
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
provide the support to the governance
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
board and to conduct these uh these risk
 
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.630 align:start position:0%
board and to conduct these uh these risk
mitigation

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
investigations and and what is also new
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
is requiring a specific risk mitigation
 
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
process be implemented the the
 
00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:34.390 align:start position:0%
process be implemented the the
department

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
I think to your point had had done quite
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
a lot in the security area and and and
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
if you looked at their workflow there
 
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
were there were several points in their
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
I.T acquisition process where they were
 
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
doing major portions of what would come
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
in in this risk mitigation strategy
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
um but it but what this does is is
 
00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299 align:start position:0%
essentially says you know let's
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
aggregate that let's get it all together
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
let's clean up the workflow and make it
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
a a significant part of of what we do to
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a
 
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
um everything in this bill is I've had
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
Private Practice the private private
 
00:21:57.529 --> 00:21:57.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:03.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
first I first I agree with your
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
observation that this is an attempt to
 
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
take the uh the benchmarks established
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
externally in the corporate world and
 
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.350 align:start position:0%
externally in the corporate world and
apply

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
the similar level of assurance to state
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
government so so it is kind of raising
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
the bar on the external benchmarks that
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
we should follow within the state
 
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:33.299 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sorry I spoke so long I
 
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:35.610 align:start position:0%
forgot the your actual question
 
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:46.370 align:start position:0%
forgot the your actual question

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak for the decades past but
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
I can speak for a little bit to the
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
challenges that the the department
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
leadership has had during the pandemic
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
to to actively switch their focus to
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
trying to manage uh you know the the
 
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
real and perceived threats of the
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh within the state and that
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
that Drew their attention so so since we
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
really have had this conversation in the
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
last two years they've been busy so so I
 
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
I do I do agree this is an attempt to
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
eliminate the double standard that
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
other questions from committee members
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative redwoods I actually had
 
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.549 align:start position:0%
representative redwoods I actually had
one

00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.390 align:start position:0%
one
um

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
quick one the membership Quorum on page
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
two and uh me on the actually the page
 
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
one talks about the governance board and
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
so forth the reference
 
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
Department's privacy officer uh is that
 
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
a new position or is that one that
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
already exists I
 
00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.299 align:start position:0%
think that's a good question they they
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
do have a privacy officer now who's an
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
attorney uh she's not specifically
 
00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:24.860 align:start position:0%
certified by the uh the information
 
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
Association of privacy professionals or
 
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
the international I'm sorry
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
International Association of privacy
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
professionals but she's steeped in
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
Privacy Law and so she's she's been
 
00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:39.419 align:start position:0%
focused and on board for about four or
 
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
five years so uh her role is I think is
 
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
vital uh assuming that she stays on
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
whoever replaces her would be a big part
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
of this governance board
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and then and then a question
 
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
for you um Mr chair if I may
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
um what would you like to do about the
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
amendment do you want me to go get an
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
amendment for the committee so you can
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
consider it an exec session that'd be
 
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
great yes sir I'll do that thank you
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Edwards
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
um next person to testify and going
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
forward the plan this morning uh and
 
00:25:16.679 --> 00:25:17.630 align:start position:0%
forward the plan this morning uh and
today

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
because of the very heavy agenda we have
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
are going to be recognizing the prime
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
sponsors to
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
playing the the Genesis of the bill and
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
and get into the background and then
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
we're going to be asking subsequent
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
testimony to be limited to three minutes
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh following the prime sponsor
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
just in the interest of time to make
 
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
sure we can give everybody a fair chance
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
to uh to testify
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
next up we would uh recognition of that
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
would like to ask representative Tony
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
Lucas to come forward he's a response of
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you the
 
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.409 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you the
committee

00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
um I don't expect to take more than that
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
I agree with uh the reason for this um I
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
come from uh you know over 40 years
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
working in I.T business often
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
almost always dealing with very
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
sensitive information
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
and and the issue is that
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
unless you have somebody who really
 
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
understands this you know the software
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
end of controlling information in the
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
Privacy end
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and is monitoring what's going on not
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
only in the I.T systems but also the
 
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
workflow and how who has access to the
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
data how it's handled the department
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
cannot know if any of the information
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
has been mishandled
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be I don't I don't know if
 
00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
there's been a release I haven't heard
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
anything major in the news but that
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that information isn't out
 
00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:48.299 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it is I'm saying the
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
department cannot know
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
if it is or is not unless they have a
 
00:26:54.649 --> 00:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
very good organized process in place
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
to deal with the handling of information
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
and the it's find it
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
um and that has to be something which is
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh put in place reviewed regularly
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
updated and then
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
has to be a close look at the training
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
of handle the information what access
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
they have and all of that and that
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
requires you know real expertise
 
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
in areas Beyond just you know the legal
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
privacy and although that's important
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
part of the whole thing
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
um that's why I support this that you
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
need that to be very well organized for
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
example I
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
and and the data has to be segregated
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
who can access it what they can do with
 
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:36.980 align:start position:0%
it there are times that I supported
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
customers where
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
um I couldn't look at their data but I
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
could support their systems for example
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
things with National Security
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
implications where I didn't have a
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
security clearance but if you set things
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
up right that is possible
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
and the department handles the most you
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
know by far the most private and the
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
largest volume in a variety of private
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
information of any part of the state
 
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
government so um that's why I'm
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
and I can briefly take questions but I
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
okay next up to testify is that Mr David
 
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
widows from the Department of Health and
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.029 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman and members
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is David
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
Wieters Information Services director
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
for Health and Human Services here at
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and thank you
 
00:28:41.649 --> 00:28:41.659 align:start position:0%
for having the time for this bill today
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
we worked in a collaborative partnership
 
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
with the committee and the coach sponsor
 
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:49.700 align:start position:0%
and the co-chair to
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
edit and look at this bill in in support
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
of this bill we were looking at how do
 
00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
we enhance the privacy and security of
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
our our department and the data that we
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
manage on behalf of the individuals in
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
our state so to address some of the
 
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
questions that came up the department
 
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
does have a very robust privacy and
 
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
security plan we go through risk
 
00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:17.059 align:start position:0%
assessments on every contract we have
 
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
incident response teams that respond to
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
any type of privacy or security
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
components however this bill essentially
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
codifies as representative Edwards
 
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
indicated what the legislature is
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
looking for in terms of a privacy and
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
security governance board and provides
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
the appropriation for additional
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
resources to do what is called a privacy
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
impact assessment so privacy impact
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
assessments are done both in the private
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
sector as well at the federal level
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
but at the state level they're not
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
always called privacy impact assessments
 
00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:51.419 align:start position:0%
sometimes we call them security risk
 
00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:54.059 align:start position:0%
assessments or we have other terms but
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
this privacy impact assessment is very
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
key to Bringing privacy on the Forefront
 
00:30:02.649 --> 00:30:02.659 align:start position:0%
one of a previous representative
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
representative Neil Kirk indicated in
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
one of the committee meetings privacy is
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
what you protect and and security is how
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
you protect it and I I fundamentally
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
agree with that statement that we need
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
to know what we're protecting and then
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
we use cyber security and I.T technology
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
to protect that data so going through
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
this bill we we appreciate the
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have this heard and
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
discussed and we hope that it will be
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
moved forward as it goes as it goes
 
00:30:33.419 --> 00:30:34.789 align:start position:0%
moved forward as it goes as it goes
through

00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I'll take brief questions if you
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
have any thank you very much
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.350 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
today

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like this will
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
this will structure and make it so that
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
survives through different legislatures
 
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
and different changes in leadership so
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a consistent plan and a
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
consistent structure that continues on
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
is that a correct understanding that is
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
correct thank you and just as a
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
follow-on we do have a data governance
 
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.529 align:start position:0%
follow-on we do have a data governance
board

00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
um this formalizes a board above that so
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
right now we're managing it at my level
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
and the director's level this takes it
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
to a commissioner level in partnership
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions from we've yes the
 
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
same question
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
I asked before to representative Edwards
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate place for this in the
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
department of health Team and services
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
or actually in the State Department of
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
Information Technology because I'm
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
looking at this and saying privacy is
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
not contained within one Department of
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
the state but it should be done
 
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
Statewide so help me understand why it
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
should only be in Department of Health
 
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
Human Services versus it being something
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
done throughout the whole state
 
00:31:48.289 --> 00:31:48.299 align:start position:0%
and that's a good question
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant um I I would
 
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
agree that it's actually two-fold so the
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
is a very large department and so we
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
have some other programs like we have in
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
information security officer which not
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
all the other departments do in order
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
for us to actually address the concerns
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
of all the programs and services at the
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
department so I think it's an
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to look at how do we
 
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
stage it at Department Health and Human
 
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
Services in partnership with doit to
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
then figure out how do we move that
 
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
across the state as we go forward so
 
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
it's a in in it we do a lot of
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
prototyping or piloting of solutions so
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
we can try to get something off the
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
ground make sure it works and then
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
expand and and move it across an
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
organization this is an opportunity that
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
all set okay thank you thank you very
 
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.210 align:start position:0%
all set okay thank you thank you very
much

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
okay I know of I have no other cards
 
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:54.419 align:start position:0%
filled out as anyone else here who
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none I am going to close the
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 91 and
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
proceed to the house bill uh the public
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 587. I would like
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
to recognize the prime sponsor of this
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
bill representative Jose kimbrils
 
00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:16.019 align:start position:0%
by the way representative am I
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
pronouncing your name right
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh for the record
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
I am representative Jose cambrils of
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County District 4 serving
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
Louden in Canterbury New Hampshire
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
I speak to you today on this organ
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
donation Rights bill as someone who
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
received a life-saving kidney transplant
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
three years ago so I am very
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about the organ
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
distribution system and how it works
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
I like to say up front that there is an
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill that should have
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
been uh distributed by OLS what's going
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
around now thank you and uh the other
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
thing is I'd like you to note that it is
 
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan Bill equally co-sponsored
 
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
by Republicans and Democrats
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill 587 is necessary for two very
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
important reasons
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
first I think everybody in here would
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
agree that an individual owns their body
 
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
and therefore should be able to will
 
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
that body or any of its parts
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
as they see fit just as they would be
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
able to do with any other asset when
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
they die
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
secondly New Hampshire citizens on the
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
transplant wait list have been
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
discriminated against and unfairly
 
00:34:32.089 --> 00:34:32.099 align:start position:0%
punished by the new organ distribution
 
00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:35.339 align:start position:0%
policy that Unos United Network for
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
organ sharing
 
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
put into place on March 15 2021.
 
00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
the previous policy was fair and
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
Equitable and used a long-standing
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
regional scheme for distribution
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was part of the New
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
England region along with Maine
 
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Connecticut Rhode Island
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
and half of Vermont
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
the new distribution policy changed all
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
that and instead went to an arbitrary
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
250 nautical mile radius from where the
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
organs are harvested as a key
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
distribution Factor
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
by doing this the vast majority of
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
organs harvested in New Hampshire are
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
now going to large out-of-state cities
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
in New Jersey and New York
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
and because their populations and their
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
their transplant wait lists dwarf those
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and the other small New
 
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
England states we have virtually no
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get deceased donor organs
 
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:28.849 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get deceased donor organs
now

00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
the new policy has devastated our New
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens on the transplant
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
waiting list it was like a gut punch to
 
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
those that had already been waiting for
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
years and had hoped that they were
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
getting close to getting an organ
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
with this new policy the average wait
 
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.870 align:start position:0%
with this new policy the average wait
time

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
to get a deceased donor organ in New
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will shoot up from a
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable three to five years
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
to another to a likely unsurvivable
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
eight to ten years
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
as a data point I received information
 
00:36:00.609 --> 00:36:00.619 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the effects of the new policy
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
at their facility
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh this is a summary comparing kidney
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
transplants from 2019 compared to to
 
00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
this recent year 2022.
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
the number of people on the waitlist has
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
gone up from 81 to 131 it's a 61.7
 
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
deaths while waiting for an organ have
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
gone up from one per year to five per
 
00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:29.270 align:start position:0%
gone up from one per year to five per
year

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's a 5x increase the number of
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
decree the number of decreased deceased
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
donor transplants are significantly down
 
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:41.099 align:start position:0%
and and worse worst of all the organs
 
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
that they are getting are of much lower
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
quality and less viability as New
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is only getting the organs
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
that have been passed up by the other
 
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.730 align:start position:0%
that have been passed up by the other
states

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:51.740 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
out States outside of New Hampshire
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
this bill is very simple as amended it
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
does two things to try to somewhat level
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
the playing field for our New Hampshire
 
00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:03.589 align:start position:0%
the playing field for our New Hampshire
citizens

00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:04.670 align:start position:0%
citizens
one

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
it will add a secondary check box
 
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
to the existing New Hampshire driver's
 
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
license slash ID application that will
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
allow our New Hampshire citizens to
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
choose New Hampshire first for their
 
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
organ donations
 
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.730 align:start position:0%
organ donations
two

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
the bill gives instruction to the
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
director of the DMV
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
to request that the New Hampshire first
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
designation becomes part of the Uno's
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
distribution algorithm
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
as a tie-breaking decision point all
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
other deciding factors being equal so
 
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
make no mistake New Hampshire is being
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
used as an organ Farm by the big
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
out-of-state cities
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
transplants are big business and big
 
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.410 align:start position:0%
transplants are big business and big
money

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
so when you hear the lobbyists behind me
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
today and some maybe even well intended
 
00:37:59.290 --> 00:37:59.300 align:start position:0%
but misguided Representatives
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
taught bring up their past talking
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
points and misdirections
 
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
please challenge them on this
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
they will tell you that the bill
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
conflicts with federal law not true
 
00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
there is no law that can govern an
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
individual's right to donate their body
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
as they wish
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
they will tell you that the bill is
 
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
unethical because it uses geography as a
 
00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339 align:start position:0%
decision Factor
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
that and they'll compare it to it being
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
like using race or religion as a factor
 
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.370 align:start position:0%
like using race or religion as a factor
false

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
false
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
the policies have always been
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
geographically based first by region and
 
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
now by the 250 nautical mile radius
 
00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099 align:start position:0%
they will tell you that other New
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
England states might follow our model
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
and pass similar legislation and that
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
that would hurt New Hampshire
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
false again Unos has already done the
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
maximum damage they could possibly do to
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire citizens with their
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
new policy in fact we welcome other New
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
England states to join us so that may be
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
the pressure will return us to the near
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
perfect regional scheme for distribution
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
that we had before
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
please ask them if this new policy has
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
helped New Hampshire weightless patients
 
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
ask them if the organs are are now more
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
viable now that they're traveling longer
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
distances and spending more time on ice
 
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
ask them how and why they came up with
 
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
this arbitrary 250 nautical mile radius
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
policy that only affects our small New
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
England states in a negative way
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
and see if they can look you in the face
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
and give you a straight answer and an
 
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
honest answer
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
last session the house Transportation
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
committee passed House Bill 583 which
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
was similar but less clean than this
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
bill by a unanimous 19-0 vote it then
 
00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:52.619 align:start position:0%
passed the New Hampshire house on a
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
it was then put into an interim study
 
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
unfortunately by the Senate HH and S
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee where it eventually died
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
this bill should address any issues that
 
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
were questioned then
 
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
I hope and pray that this committee will
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
recommend that this very bipartisan bill
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
will be ought to pass as amended and I
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions about
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes yes sir representative Shapiro
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
taking this question with the new policy
 
00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:29.579 align:start position:0%
of 250 nautical mile radius
 
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
how our organs prioritized
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
how come they how come so many more go
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
to cities the reason would be since the
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
250 nautical miles is a major factor in
 
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
their algorithm naturally you you can
 
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
imagine New York City has a population
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
of 10 million 12 million I don't even
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
know anymore it's uh 10 times the entire
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
population of New Hampshire so therefore
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
their wait lists are much longer and
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
their people have been waiting on the
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
list much longer and again due to their
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
own issue their issue there is that
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
they're not a donor State relative to
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
the population they have very few people
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's that sign up to be organ donors
 
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
whereas New Hampshire is one of the top
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
donor States relative to our population
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
we have many many more people sign up to
 
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
be organ donors so they're taking
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
advantage of our system
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
so one of the objections that we are
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
getting is uh that it's based on New
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver license but a person
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire driver license can be
 
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
at least Temple leaving let's say in
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
California and if he has a New Hampshire
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
they say it would be in this scenario to
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
Buddhism to move the organs from
 
00:41:58.810 --> 00:41:58.820 align:start position:0%
such a distance can you
 
00:42:02.329 --> 00:42:02.339 align:start position:0%
speak to this scenario I'm I'm not quite
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
sure I apologize that I understand the
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
question does it have to do with uh
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
driver's license and notification on the
 
00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
driver's license or so
 
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
the objection is that uh
 
00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:19.460 align:start position:0%
um we specify New Hampshire
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
residents but maybe even though by
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
document the New Hampshire residents
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
maybe they temporarily live in a distant
 
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.450 align:start position:0%
maybe they temporarily live in a distant
state

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
and if
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
this uh I think I can answer that
 
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:38.579 align:start position:0%
question by so first of all the when you
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
sign up to be an organ donor at the
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
register the the real record is held at
 
00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
the registry of motor vehicles on their
 
00:42:46.619 --> 00:42:47.569 align:start position:0%
the registry of motor vehicles on their
database

00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:47.579 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
the driver's license has an indicator
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
that you're an organ donor however that
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
does not really mean anything all that
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
does is it alerts uh emergency Personnel
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
that you are a potential donor they
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
still have to check the registry at the
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
DMV so if somebody has moved out of
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
state uh and they no longer have a New
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Drive
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
the record is held at the DMV database
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
so that would be updated as required if
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
somebody in fact you can sign up as an
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
organ donor have the designation the
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
little heart on your license and three
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
months later if you decide you do not
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
want to be an organ donor you go to the
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
DMV and have them remove it from the
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
from the actual database so everything
 
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
is controlled in a database and not
 
00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:35.099 align:start position:0%
necessarily what's on the driver's
 
00:43:35.099 --> 00:43:35.930 align:start position:0%
necessarily what's on the driver's
license

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
any other questions sir representative
 
00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.510 align:start position:0%
any other questions sir representative
Gambrills

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
Gambrills
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
um you kind of
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
address oh I'm sorry thank you Mr
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
question I'm getting better at this so
 
00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.430 align:start position:0%
question I'm getting better at this so
um

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
you kind of addressed this a little bit
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
in your testimony but what I'm wondering
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
is is this ceremonials and enforceable
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
what are the barriers to actually making
 
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:02.900 align:start position:0%
this real
 
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
to be honest the main barrier is that um
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
when our director of the DMV sends the
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
request to have New Hampshire as part of
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
the algorithm it's going to be incumbent
 
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
upon the Unos who is a federally
 
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
contracted organization to follow their
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
direction if they do not follow it then
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
um we'll see where the chips fall after
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
that because they will be violating a
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
um it was actually
 
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
um kind of a spin-off from uh
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Paul zav's question uh if
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
a patient if a New Hampshire resident is
 
00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:56.099 align:start position:0%
in an accident and
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
um who's a an organ donor is in an
 
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
accident or something in another state
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
far away
 
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
um is it going to be
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
a challenge you know for them to donate
 
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
to an appropriate donor if they're in a
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean if it's very far
 
00:45:17.329 --> 00:45:17.339 align:start position:0%
then there's an added layer of getting
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
it to New Hampshire if that's the only
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
place that they want their organs to go
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so thank you and that also helps
 
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
to clarify what representative pulls up
 
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
said no um uh not at all because
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
remember all the other criteria still
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
are in place before that this is not a
 
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire only this is a New
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first where possible as a
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
tiebreaker so uh the New Hampshire
 
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
Factor does not Trump any of the
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
existing of course you have to match by
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
tissue type you have to uh the amount of
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
time that the per people have spent on
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
the wait list all that supersedes this
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
this is simply a tie breaker and quite
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
frankly the reason this bill is put
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
forth is to bring attention to the
 
00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
situation that we went from a near
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
perfect distribution scheme to one that
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
is punishing to our citizens and this is
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
00:46:19.319 --> 00:46:20.870 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
cambrell's

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
cambrell's
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman also thank you for
 
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
it's a sort of a follow-up on what
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman has spoken to if
 
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
you're out of state but at the same time
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
do we need to have something like this
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
if it's in fact housed in the Department
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles could that be added
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
there because it sounds like that's the
 
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
controlling Factor no matter what I put
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
on my driver's license
 
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to go back to the
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles to validate
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
that I didn't revoke it
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
so should this be more in the Department
 
00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles in their database
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
versus it being on the driver's license
 
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
itself no this is exactly what this
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
build does uh the the little icon so
 
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
when you see the applications today for
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
the driver's license or the New
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ID right now there's one check
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
box that doesn't that give makes you an
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
organ donor what this bill does is it
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
adds a second box that directs the DMV
 
00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:20.099 align:start position:0%
that you are a New Hampshire first organ
 
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
donor and that's what will go on the
 
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
record in their database so the the
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
driver's license does not change at all
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
the driver's license still has the same
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
icon if you're an organ donor but what
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
this does is it adds the second uh level
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
so that the DMV will have in their
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
database that you are a New Hampshire
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
first organ donor so that you'll have
 
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
that designation in the algorithm so
 
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
this in fact does go to the database it
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
is controlled by
 
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.890 align:start position:0%
is controlled by
bye-bye

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
bye-bye
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
other questions for yes follow-up just
 
00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.690 align:start position:0%
other questions for yes follow-up just
unclear

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
um no matter what I do with my driver's
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
license when I sign up for the driver's
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
license itself I still have the
 
00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.170 align:start position:0%
license itself I still have the
opportunity

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
to call the Department of Motor Vehicles
 
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
to revoke that on my driver's license is
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct your
 
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
driver's license will continue to have
 
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
the little heart on it until you renew
 
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
it however the database will reflect
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
that you are no longer an organ donor
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.430 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
cambrell's

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
cambrell's
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay again we'll be limiting testimony
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
here on on this bill up to three minutes
 
00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:32.099 align:start position:0%
uh the next step to speak is
 
00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mark Pearson I am

committee and a member of the health
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
human services and elderly Affairs
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
committee Alumni Association it should
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
be recognized the previous chairman of
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
this committee so welcome back thank you
 
00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
it's great to be back sir and so good to
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
see this committee still in good hands
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
at first glance House Bill 587 commends
 
00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:07.790 align:start position:0%
at first glance House Bill 587 commends
itself

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I jumped on last
 
00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.450 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I jumped on last
session

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
because the bill spoke of a fixing a
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
decal or symbol on a person's driver's
 
00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:20.099 align:start position:0%
license or a non-driver's picture ID
 
00:49:22.609 --> 00:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
that bill was sent to the transportation
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee which evaluated it on the
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
basis of could we put a sticker on the
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license and they said yeah we
 
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
can do that so they passed it
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
unanimously and it went on its merry way
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
on the way to the Senate however several
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
people looked at the bill I was one of
 
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
them I'm married to a physician I talked
 
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
with many of her colleagues I believe
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
I'm a well-guided representative in
 
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
terms of the research I've done
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
and I looked at it from the perspective
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
of politics ethics legality and
 
00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.990 align:start position:0%
of politics ethics legality and
practicality

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
practicality
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
at that point several issues came to the
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
surface which led me then to speak
 
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:02.579 align:start position:0%
against the bill
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
before the Senate
 
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services Committee
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
of the Senate voted 5-0 to itl the bill
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
and it was then tabled
 
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
the bill is back appropriately this time
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
before this committee and I must again
 
00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
speak against it under those four
 
00:50:19.859 --> 00:50:21.650 align:start position:0%
speak against it under those four
criteria

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
first of all politics
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass
 
00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
I'm sure Massachusetts would pass
 
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
something similar
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
last time before the Senate a New
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident testified she
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
received a transplanted heart of a
 
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
deceased Massachusetts resident at toss
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
Medical Center
 
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
ahead of a Massachusetts resident no
 
00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:46.490 align:start position:0%
ahead of a Massachusetts resident no
tiebreakers

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
tiebreakers
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
she was according to the criteria at the
 
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
top of the list if we have such a law as
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes and Massachusetts
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
then had reciprocated that New Hampshire
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
resident would now be dead but she's not
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
secondly ethics there is an established
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
protocol that provides organs go to the
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
person most in need who is the best
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
match who is within the time window
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
needed and so on and so on
 
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
while is it is ethical for one to name a
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
close relative as a recipient
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
we do not discriminate on other bases
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
it is considered unethical
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
thirdly law federal law governs the
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
allocation of organs donated under the
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
Uniform Anatomical Gift Act and it
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
preempts the state from deviating from
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
the organ procurement and transportation
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
networks system of organ distribution
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
the place to change that is in
 
00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.809 align:start position:0%
the place to change that is in
Washington

00:51:49.809 --> 00:51:49.819 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
practicality the federally designated
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
organ procurement organization has
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
designated New England donor Services
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
Neds as the organization responsible for
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
coordinating organ and tissue donation
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
for transplant in the six New England
 
00:52:07.859 --> 00:52:08.870 align:start position:0%
for transplant in the six New England
states

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations require hospitals to
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
refer all inpatient deaths to the local
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
opo in our case nads for the assignment
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
of medically suitability and conveyance
 
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
to the recipients according to
 
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
established criteria as to who's on the
 
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
top of the wait list let me put this
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
bluntly if this bill becomes law nothing
 
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
will change the hospitals will still
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
call Neds Ned's will still follow the
 
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
we could argue whether those regulations
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
are now good the place to change them is
 
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.349 align:start position:0%
are now good the place to change them is
Washington

00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative you could start wrapping
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
up I am okay thank you and I have a
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
handout and the handout has testimony
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
from the Senate last year and it has a
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
variety of Articles which cite the
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
various regulations and laws may I hand
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
okay representative do you want to take
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
questions are you prepared to take
 
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.130 align:start position:0%
questions are you prepared to take
questions

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Pearson
 
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
former chairman
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about the
 
00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:34.940 align:start position:0%
transplant patient down in Massachusetts
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh do you know if that patient if those
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
two patients were completely tied and
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
then in a tiebreaker if Massachusetts
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
adopted the same process this resident
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
would have lost out or if when you
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
trickle through the entire Matrix of
 
00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:53.220 align:start position:0%
decision factors there was a significant
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
difference between the two which is
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
question I don't know the specifics of
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
that except she was on the top of the
 
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.530 align:start position:0%
that except she was on the top of the
list

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and that's why she
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
was given her heart I think the top of
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
the list from everybody thank you
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for
 
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:15.170 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry go ahead thank you chairman
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you representative
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
Pearson my question is do you agree with
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
the representative cambrell's that there
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
was a near perfect scheme a few short
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
years ago a few short years ago and that
 
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
it changed to something much worse if
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
you and if you do agree with that how
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
would you go about changing it is there
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
anything that could be done at the state
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
level thank you hey I don't know if the
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
system previously were bet was better or
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
not and B since this is what we have the
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
place to change it is at that Federal
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
level with the appropriate federal laws
 
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
and regulations and so on we cannot
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
unilaterally make a difference on that
 
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
in a given state
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
okay another question representative
 
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.490 align:start position:0%
okay another question representative
Merchant

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative it's good to see you
 
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.770 align:start position:0%
representative it's good to see you
again

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
what I call organ escalation in one
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
state trying to protect itself another
 
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
state following suit
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
what I heard before from the sponsor
 
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has an active donor
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
program and other states do may not
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
so how do we somehow ensure that because
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
we have such an active program in our
 
00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
state that our residents actually
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
benefit from that active program versus
 
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
the donuts our organs being sent out of
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
state because they don't have such the
 
00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:44.579 align:start position:0%
same level of activity in their program
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a pretty strong 10th Amendment
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
person and I love New Hampshire with the
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
Zeal of a convert
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
um I would encourage other states to do
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
this this is this whole thing is a
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
regional thing not a state thing this is
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay next up to testify is Alexandra
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
grazier from the New England donor
 
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.990 align:start position:0%
grazier from the New England donor
services

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
hopefully I pronounced your name
 
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:29.930 align:start position:0%
hopefully I pronounced your name
correctly

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
a microphone
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
hit the button for the microphone how's
 
00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
that that's great wonderful
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
I am Alexandra Glazier I'm the president
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
and CEO of New England donor Services we
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
are the charitable non-profit
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
organization the Oregon procurement
 
00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
organization the opo that is responsible
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
for coordinating deceased organ donation
 
00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:53.579 align:start position:0%
for transplant in the New England states
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
and of course importantly here in New
 
00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.170 align:start position:0%
and of course importantly here in New
Hampshire

00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:56.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
I do want to I I have submitted written
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
testimony that's quite extensive and I
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
don't want to take the time to repeat
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
that here but I do want to address a
 
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
couple of pieces of significant
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
misinformation that have been presented
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
this morning the current allocation
 
00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
system already has a tiebreaker built
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
into it that's based on proximity and
 
00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:19.140 align:start position:0%
what I mean by that is if you have two
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
patients that otherwise are similarly
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
situated in terms of the medical urgency
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the time waiting in terms of
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
the biological match with an available
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
organ then the patient who is closer to
 
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
where the donor organ is available will
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
be prioritized and is currently
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
prioritized that is the tie breaker keep
 
00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:44.819 align:start position:0%
in mind that organ allocation is for the
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of patience not States so that
 
00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
the entire higher system of organ
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
allocation and regulation thereof is
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
focused on how to prioritize patients
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
most in need and do so fairly let me
 
00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
talk about fairly
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
since this policy was changed and
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
actually let me take a moment and just
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
say why the policy was changed because
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
in fact the service area was imperfect
 
00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
and patients important patients were
 
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged like pediatric patients
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
who were not seeing the the same volume
 
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
of transplant across the country also
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
other disparities racial ethnic and
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
Geographic disparities existed and so
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
the change to move to a 250 mile circle
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
for kidneys which was also replicated
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
for other organs was done in order to
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
standardize the unit of distribution of
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
organs but again
 
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
circled around where the donor is so the
 
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
idea of proximity remains a key
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
component of all this what did the data
 
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:48.020 align:start position:0%
show since this policy was implemented
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
kidneys from deceased donors that were
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
transplanted in New Hampshire went from
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
12 in 2020 to 9 in 2021 to 11 in 2022 22
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
percent increase has occurred since this
 
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
policy was implemented in 2021 through
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
the end of this prior year those are
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
transplants in New Hampshire please keep
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
in mind that New Hampshire has a single
 
00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
transplant program and only kidneys so
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
any New Hampshire resident requiring a
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
heart requiring a lung requiring a liver
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
or pancreas is going to have to travel
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire so while the
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor may not be concerned if other
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
states implement this law those patients
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
who are waiting for hearts livers lungs
 
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:36.299 align:start position:0%
will certainly care and be concerned
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
because they must receive their
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
transplant care outside of New Hampshire
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
it is indeed a regional system here the
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
other thing I would mention is that
 
00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:48.299 align:start position:0%
organ transplants of all types for New
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents regardless of which
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
state it occurred because again all of
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
the transplants other than kidney are
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
occurring outside New Hampshire for New
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire patients saw a 36 percent
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
increase this past year from 2021 when
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
there were 72 deceased organ transplants
 
01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
for patients who reside in New Hampshire
 
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
to 98 in 2022 that is the National Data
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's publicly available and it is in
 
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
my testimony so I think just to sum it
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
up because I'd really like to take any
 
01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.299 align:start position:0%
questions you have since we are the
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
entity responsible for doing the
 
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
coordination of this work I would say
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
that this bill is unnecessary because
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
tiebreaker based on proximity is already
 
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
built into the national policy that it
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
would disadvantage New Hampshire
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
patients particularly those needing
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
anything other than kidney I'd also
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
half of the New Hampshire residents who
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
received kidney transplants last year
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
did so outside of New Hampshire the
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
program in New Hampshire is quite small
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
and it's at Dartmouth so those who live
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
in the southern part of the state tend
 
01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:53.180 align:start position:0%
to seek their transplant care elsewhere
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
with that I am I'm happy to answer any
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:02.339 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for the MS
 
01:01:02.339 --> 01:01:06.470 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for the MS

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
my question uh do you have any data to
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
um to extend what we heard before that
 
01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
the waiting line in New Hampshire uh in
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
some hospitals increased from three to
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
five to eight years and also like the
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
number of deaths on waiting lists
 
01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
increased significantly
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
that I do not believe that it's accurate
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
to say patients are waiting eight years
 
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
for kidney transplant and that is not
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
what the National Data show and that is
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
been carefully monitored at the federal
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
level because the entire intent of this
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
change in allocation policy is to
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
equalize the transplant weight and the
 
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
modeling that was done and so so far the
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
data that we see with that first full
 
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
year after the policy was implemented is
 
01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
that the wait times have not gone up
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
substantially and that the transplant
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
numbers have increased across the board
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
as for deaths on the waitlist I have not
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
looked at that data in particular for
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but again I would say that
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
this is being monitored nationally and
 
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
the entire purpose of the policy is to
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's an increase in
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
transplant which has occurred year over
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
year in the U.S and that those most in
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
need most urgently in need are being
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
transplanted first based on a number of
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
factors including proximity to the donor
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
organ which as I mentioned is a key part
 
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
of the current policy and is used in in
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
tiebreaker and actually let me give an
 
01:02:48.049 --> 01:02:48.059 align:start position:0%
example of that if a patient is waiting
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth for for a kidney and a
 
01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
patient that is similarly situated in
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
terms of Acuity sickness and is a
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
biological match is waiting at Yale New
 
01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
Haven Hospital in Connecticut if a
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
kidney becomes available in New
 
01:03:05.089 --> 01:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's the equivalent of that
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
patient would receive the kidney two
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
years ahead of the patient at Yale
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
that's the way the scoring system works
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
in terms of using proximity to ensure
 
01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:20.339 align:start position:0%
that kidneys are are allocated first to
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
those in need and in a tiebreaker
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
situation closest to where the donor
 
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
becomes available
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up sure follow-up uh
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
would you be able to look for that data
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
specifically for New Hampshire and if
 
01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
you find it to send it to us of course
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
and just so I make sure I provide what
 
01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking for New Hampshire
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
or New Hampshire patients waiting
 
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.750 align:start position:0%
or New Hampshire patients waiting
anywhere

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.910 align:start position:0%
anywhere
um

01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
if you can find it okay
 
01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:56.809 align:start position:0%
if you can find it okay
um

01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah be happy to do that thank you thank
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
you representative thank you any other
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and also thank you
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
Miss Glazier for taking my question
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
it appears to be the only place that we
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
have sort of a say you know so much to
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
say but in New Hampshire anyways because
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth only does at this point in
 
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
time kidney transplants
 
01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.299 align:start position:0%
help me understand if I am a living
 
01:04:27.299 --> 01:04:28.970 align:start position:0%
help me understand if I am a living
donor

01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
donor
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
I get to say where I want that kidney to
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
go I have control over it is that
 
01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.690 align:start position:0%
go I have control over it is that
correct

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
yes that's a correct however once I
 
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.430 align:start position:0%
yes that's a correct however once I
deceased

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
deceased
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
I lose that Authority
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
yes and so uh the Uniform Anatomical
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
Gift Act is a state law that has been
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
enacted in every state in the country
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
that governs the
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
um the donation of organs after your
 
01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
death and what the Uniform Anatomical
 
01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:02.339 align:start position:0%
Gift Act has said for over 40 years here
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and in every state in
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
the country is that upon your death you
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
can make a gift specifically to an
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
individual just as you can when you're
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
living what you can't do
 
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
is make it to a category of individuals
 
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
and that is in fact what this bill would
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
be attempting to do and that's also true
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
as a living donor you cannot say I wish
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
to give my kidney but but only to a
 
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
child or or only just someone of a
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
certain race or religion so you can name
 
01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:32.339 align:start position:0%
an individual and it's intended to
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
ensure there is some autonomy rights
 
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
built into the system such that if you
 
01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
have a personal relationship a family
 
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
member who could benefit from that gift
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that is permitted otherwise the
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
system is really designed to maximize
 
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
the saving of lives and the way to do
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
that is to prioritize the sickest
 
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
Patients First within a biological match
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
and within a geographic distance that
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
will ensure the usability of the organ
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
for its intended purpose transplant
 
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification thank
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
you yes representative did you have a
 
01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.970 align:start position:0%
you yes representative did you have a
question

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
I asked this question before and I'd
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
like to hear the answer from you I mean
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
we can do whatever we want here but is
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
it enforceable that this bill passed
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
would that be enforceable
 
01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339 align:start position:0%
I I believe that National allocation
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
which is done at HHS through regulations
 
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
through statute federal statute preempts
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
any state law that would alter organ
 
01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
allocation as to whether or not you
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
could put a check box you know on the
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
license itself you know obviously that's
 
01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
up to you and your Authority but as the
 
01:06:41.089 --> 01:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
organization that's held responsible to
 
01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
follow Federal Regulation we would have
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
a conflict in law and that would also be
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
true for any transplant program like
 
01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:51.299 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth who is responsible and
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
obligated to follow federal law
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:06:59.809 --> 01:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here to answer these
 
01:06:59.819 --> 01:07:01.010 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here to answer these
questions

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
um I I looked over the criteria and the
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
laws the Federal Regulations around
 
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
allocation and it only said that you
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
cannot specify it based on state or
 
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
geography unless it's included in items
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
one through five some of those were
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
talking about equity and when you are
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
presenting your data you said that there
 
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
were issues around pediatric racial
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
ethnic and Geographic discrimination my
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
question is if there's I recognize that
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
your data from 2020 2021 and 2022 show
 
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't a problem then which
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
is fantastic but that's also been the
 
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
covid years I'd be interested in a
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
longer look at historically what our
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
rates are to try and figure out and make
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
sure that there are not inequities for
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
our patients whether they're here or
 
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
sitting at Mass General where you'd have
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
the same distance factor and there could
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
be a tiebreaker just I'd like to
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
understand how their human Geographic
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination and how we can address
 
01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
that if that's in fact in here yeah
 
01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and the
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
statutory site you found is exactly what
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
was relied upon to ensure that this
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
allocation reform was actually
 
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
accomplished and that's because as I
 
01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
mentioned we want to make sure that
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
proximity is part of the allocation
 
01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
system for two reasons one to make sure
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
organs remain viable so this is why
 
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
we're not shipping Hearts from Boston to
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
California yet someday we might have
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
Innovation so we'll allow us to do that
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
but that proximity is a really important
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
part to ensuring organ viability and
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
also that proximity is an important part
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
to making sure that there's not
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
Geographic disparities and so for what
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
we saw in the previous policy is relying
 
01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
on service areas which are highly
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
variable so ours was the six New England
 
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
states but for example there were three
 
01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:49.259 align:start position:0%
opio service areas in Ohio in one state
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
and when you look across the country and
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
there's 56 opos there are service areas
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
were highly variable and so what that
 
01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
resulted in was Geographic disparities
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
because it was the service area of the
 
01:09:04.669 --> 01:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
of the opio being used as a proximity
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
measure instead what the system did was
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
make it uniform I said we're going to
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
use 250 miles rather than service areas
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
so it's the same all the way across the
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
country and what we've seen is that the
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
geographic disparities have actually
 
01:09:21.289 --> 01:09:21.299 align:start position:0%
already significantly reduced as to
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
whether the system was working well for
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
our region beforehand I can tell you
 
01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:28.259 align:start position:0%
that patients in New England waited much
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
longer than other areas of the country
 
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
especially for livers especially for
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
livers but for other organs as well and
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
what this reform did because it was done
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
across the board for every organ was
 
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
start to reduce that disparity and that
 
01:09:47.209 --> 01:09:47.219 align:start position:0%
was the primary goal of that reform and
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
it is being monitored so we certainly
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
can provide additional data you
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned for example you know what did
 
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
it look like before well I can tell you
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
before covet in 2017 there there was a
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
single deceased kidney donation
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
transplant in New Hampshire one and in
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
2022 there were 11. in 2018 there were
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
five in 2019 big jump up there were 13.
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
and then the years that you mentioned 12
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
9 and 11. so we really you know have not
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
seen a negative impact of this organ
 
01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
allocation policy for either transplants
 
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
performed in New Hampshire which would
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
be kidney transplants at Dartmouth or
 
01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
most importantly I would think for New
 
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents in need of any
 
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
transplant and those transplants
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
occurring in multiple different states
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
another question Jeff yes sir
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
I have one more question thank you Mr
 
01:10:42.659 --> 01:10:44.149 align:start position:0%
I have one more question thank you Mr
chairman

01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
um what I want to understand 250 miles
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
what states do you represent
 
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
so our organization covers all six New
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
England states although Vermont is split
 
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
down the middle so we service the
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
Eastern portion of Vermont Maine New
 
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island and
 
01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.050 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island and
Connecticut

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:02.060 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
but the the system and the allocation
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
policies are done at the national level
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
through Department of Health and Human
 
01:11:11.689 --> 01:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
Services which oversees the organ
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
procurement and Transplant Network the
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
optn which as mentioned before is run
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
through contract with eunos which runs
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
the wait list
 
01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir go ahead thank you Mr
 
01:11:24.659 --> 01:11:25.729 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir go ahead thank you Mr
chairman

01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
um I have a quick question about
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
priorities or discrimination is it under
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
current law is it possible for
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
um well for example
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
um citizenship or legal status is it
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
possible right now that an illegal
 
01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
immigrant could have priority or get an
 
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
organ over a U.S citizen so citizen
 
01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
Citizenship status is not part of the
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
allocation policy by federal statute
 
01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
allocation policy is to be based on
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
medical criteria
 
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
and geography to the extent required for
 
01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
the same reasons we were speaking about
 
01:12:04.739 --> 01:12:05.830 align:start position:0%
the same reasons we were speaking about
before

01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
to ensure organs aren't wasted and that
 
01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
they remain viable and to ensure that
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
there's equity in the system so
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
citizenship is not currently considered
 
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
keep in mind too that deceased donors
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
come from any individual who happens to
 
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
be here when they die and one other
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
point I might make about that and
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up to one that was made earlier
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
we are we benefit from a region that has
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
great donor registration rates and also
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
authorization rates by the family but
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
that's actually true in many other parts
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the country as well and while
 
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
historically New York had lower rates
 
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
they've had significant increases over
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
the past three years which coincide with
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
this policy change as well in fact last
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
year alone I think that their growth
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
surpassed the national average by either
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
two or three-fold
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
do you know hands so so okay thank you
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
okay next up to testify is John marasco
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Division of Motor
 
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:20.510 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Division of Motor
Vehicles

01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you for the the
 
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak before you this
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
morning my name is John marasco I'm the
 
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
director of The Division of Motor
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
Vehicles here in New Hampshire you've
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
already heard testimony we do oppose
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
this bill I won't take a a few moments
 
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
to offer some thoughts
 
01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:41.219 align:start position:0%
um one of the one of the areas I wanted
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
to address as far as if this bill were
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
to pass from a a financial standpoint it
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
would be an update to our form and and
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's something that we could we could
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
certainly handle there were a few
 
01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
technical defects in this bill when you
 
01:13:59.930 --> 01:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
review the current statute one of which
 
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
is the current statute 263.41 does
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
identify exactly what is
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
relayed from the New Hampshire DMV to
 
01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
New England donor services
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
and if uh if there was a change to the
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
form that information as far as New
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
um is not uh is not actually in this
 
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
bill and that would um that would have
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
to be something that would have to be
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
added because the criteria are very
 
01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.169 align:start position:0%
added because the criteria are very
specific

01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
um the other piece that would have to be
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
reviewed is um what the symbol on the
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
license what it would not look like if
 
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
there was going to be a change if it was
 
01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based only
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
um we uh we did testify on this bill
 
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
when it previously came up we opposed it
 
01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:44.870 align:start position:0%
when it previously came up we opposed it
then

01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously you've heard the
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
testimony here and many of those items
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
are things that we have discussed with
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
New England donor Services I can tell
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
you that the New Hampshire DMV has a a
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
very strong relationship we have 54
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
percent of New Hampshire residents that
 
01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
do donate when they come into the DMVs
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
and and that's a very positive number
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
um that's what I have for you this
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
morning so I'm happy to take any
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just needed the
 
01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
statutory reference again that you that
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
you stated yes uh 263.41 donor registry
 
01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
for anatomical gifts
 
01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
thank you I was nowhere near close so I
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
we're all set thank you very much thank
 
01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:44.510 align:start position:0%
we're all set thank you very much thank
you

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:03.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
microphone please thank you Mr chairman
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
and good morning everyone my name is
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
Kelly George I live in Enfield New
 
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am a heart transplant
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
recipient and I oppose this bill
 
01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
on December 3rd 2009 I received the gift
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
of con continued life from an anonymous
 
01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.189 align:start position:0%
of con continued life from an anonymous
donor

01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
donor
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
prior to my transplant I struggled each
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
day with end-stage heart failure
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
once listed each day brought anxiety and
 
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
worry wondering if that call saying our
 
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
heart had been found would come to save
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
my life
 
01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire's only Transplant
 
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
Center Dartmouth health does not perform
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
heart transplants I was referred to
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
Tufts Medical Center in Boston
 
01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
together the two medical centers care
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
for me until the long awaiting call came
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
on December 2nd 2009 I made my way to
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts received my transplant and
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
have enjoyed a full life since
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
hearing the words you have two years
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
maybe less before you need a transplant
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
to survive was devastating
 
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
if our surrounding states were to adopt
 
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
a bill similar to HB 587 the heart I
 
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
received could have been limited to a
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
resident of one of those States one who
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
was not as sick as me one who had more
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
time to wait than me
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
if that had happened I would not be
 
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
sitting here with you today
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
there is a cost to implement this bill
 
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
if we use those funds to educate the
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
public about organ donation and the need
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
to become registered donors
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could help to increase the
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
number of organs available to the
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
residents of our great state of New
 
01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.310 align:start position:0%
residents of our great state of New
Hampshire

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
I urge you to honor the edu the ethical
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
and responsible policy of sick is first
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
which has been demonstrated to save more
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
lives including my own and soundly
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
reject the Alternatives that needlessly
 
01:18:03.169 --> 01:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
put transplant patients at risk
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
thank you are you taking questions or
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
any questions from Ms George
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
I see you have a written testimony and
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
there will only have one copy so when
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
you're done can I have it you certainly
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
may thank you I have two you can have
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
mine okay representative clerk so he's
 
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:55.310 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and good to see
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
you all and
 
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's strange being here on the side of
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
the microphone
 
01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.169 align:start position:0%
the microphone
um

01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
I have some prepare remarks but there's
 
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
a few things I just want to say first
 
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
one be careful the statistics you hear
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
for for example we heard statistics
 
01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.110 align:start position:0%
for for example we heard statistics
about

01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
the number of transplants at Dartmouth
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
staying about the same but there's no
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
distinction between live uh donations
 
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
and deceased donations
 
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
and it's my information that the number
 
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
of deceased donations has gone down but
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
the number of live donations has not
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
secondly you heard a testimony about the
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
transportation committee last year I was
 
01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
fortunate to be assigned as a fill-in to
 
01:19:59.470 --> 01:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
the executive session on the
 
01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:02.219 align:start position:0%
transportation committee last year when
 
01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
it uh considered the bill and I can tell
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
you it was not a matter of you know
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
could they put the sticker on the
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
um driver's license or not the
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
transportation committee considered the
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
entire range of issues having to do with
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of it there are other
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
things I could comment on but first of
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
all I want to say I'm 100 in favor of
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
this legislation either the Standalone
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
or the amendment and I would have caused
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
sponsored it had I remained in the house
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
I am a year out myself from a live
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
kidney transplant so I'm not directly
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill except to the
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
extent that if the ability of Dartmouth
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock to take to continue its
 
01:20:56.689 --> 01:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
program is significantly affected I
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
would have a small impact because I go
 
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
back at this point
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
um it's just got changed you just said
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
my first anniversary so it's every six
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
months now and other than that I'm not
 
01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:10.940 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill
 
01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.470 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill
and

01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I do want to comment about the wait
 
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.430 align:start position:0%
um I do want to comment about the wait
time

01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
I was considerably older than most
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
people who get a kidney transplant most
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
places cut that off at 70. I was 75. uh
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth was willing to do it there's
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
many hospitals in our surrounding area
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
that do not if I had to wait extra time
 
01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
I had a live donation for my sister in
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
New York City if I had to wait
 
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
eight years
 
01:21:45.649 --> 01:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
instead of two or three I would not have
 
01:21:46.930 --> 01:21:46.940 align:start position:0%
gotten a kidney
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
and I would have not survived
 
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
so the issue of the increased wait time
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
which is a fact
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
is of crucial importance to people like
 
01:21:57.719 --> 01:22:00.290 align:start position:0%
is of crucial importance to people like
me

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:02.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:05.219 align:start position:0%
nothing I hear say here should be looked
 
01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
at as legal advice okay first
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
you have about 10 seconds representative
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
what you're up about 10 seconds left
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
well I'm going to I may land up as
 
01:22:18.649 --> 01:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
others taking a little bit longer I'll
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
skip to the important thing as far best
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
I can tell HB 587 does not violate any
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
federal law this bill does not mandate
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
any deceased stone or donor organs be
 
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
available in New Hampshire only any
 
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
granted stator can leave their organ to
 
01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
the General Pool
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
in fact the Unos distribution scheme
 
01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
is completely voluntary you hear federal
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
laws being broken Federal Regulations
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
bring broken you can't break it by not
 
01:22:53.689 --> 01:22:53.699 align:start position:0%
following a voluntary law it's a bit
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
like getting auto insurance in New
 
01:22:58.729 --> 01:22:58.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you're not breaking any law if
 
01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
you don't get auto insurance though if
 
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
you do get it there's rules and
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
regulations and I'll give you a quote
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
from the federal 11th Circuit Court of
 
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
Appeals none of the optns adopted
 
01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
policies are in and of themselves
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
legally enforceable against members of
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
the transplant Community rather
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
compliance is strictly voluntary and for
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
those who want to look it up that's the
 
01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
Callahan case
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
um there's a significant issue of
 
01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.189 align:start position:0%
um there's a significant issue of
resources

01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
across the board in rural areas in the
 
01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
medical world
 
01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth hitch Cheshire hospital had to
 
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
close his psychiatric
 
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
adolescent unit a couple years ago
 
01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't get a doctor we
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
all know the difficulty in getting
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
nurses at our County nursing homes we
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
just can't get them they're not there
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
we have one transplant unit
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
I'm from I heard people in Southern New
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire don't go to Dartmouth I live
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
virtually On the Border
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
outside of Keene and I went to Dartmouth
 
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
and after my transplant I had to go up
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
there three times a week
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
can you imagine having to go to Boston
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
three times a week
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
especially when you can't drive
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
and then it was reduced to two times a
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
week and then once a week Etc
 
01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
it's it would have been I would have had
 
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
to rent an apartment in Boston if I had
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
to have my transplant in Boston and
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative you could start wrapping
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
up please all right
 
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
in that case I will wrap up two thoughts
 
01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.290 align:start position:0%
in that case I will wrap up two thoughts
one

01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
if I can leave my Mustang to anybody I
 
01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.130 align:start position:0%
if I can leave my Mustang to anybody I
want

01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
and if I can leave
 
01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
money to a church or a synagogue if I
 
01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:55.310 align:start position:0%
money to a church or a synagogue if I
wish

01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
wish
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
I should be able to leave my organ
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
to a granted stator
 
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
and that's just part of my freedom as an
 
01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.530 align:start position:0%
and that's just part of my freedom as an
individual

01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
and the final thing I want to say is
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively young group here
 
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
if any of you are of an age
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
and of sufficient help
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
let me plead with you
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
be a Kidney donor there's a hundred and
 
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
six thousand people in this country
 
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
waiting for a kidney
 
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
people die every day waiting for kidney
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
and other organs you can save a life
 
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's amazing thing to do you can save a
 
01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
life thank you thank you open to
 
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
questions I have an article Vermont
 
01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
Man's Search for a kidney Complicated by
 
01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
new rules for organ donations I just
 
01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
happen to come across it and my written
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
remarks okay great if you could give us
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
if you're getting me marks that'd be
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
great but questions yes sir
 
01:25:59.930 --> 01:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
um and appreciate that you're here to
 
01:26:04.729 --> 01:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
talk to us
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
um my world is driven by lies damn lies
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
and statistics so I do appreciate the
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
first thing you said and I also
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the distinction that you made
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
between live and deceased because we're
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
really only talking about deceased
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
donors here but
 
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
um Ms Glacier provided us some
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
statistics here that actually I guess it
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
contradicts what you said here this is
 
01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
kidney transplants performed in New
 
01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where they found that there
 
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
was actually an increased incidence of
 
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
kidneys from deceased donors over the
 
01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:35.219 align:start position:0%
last six years the first two years there
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
was small numbers kidneys from living
 
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
donors have pretty much flatlined the
 
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
entire that's a bad term to use um
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
stayed stable over that period of time
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
but the numbers are actually fairly
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
equal do you have any comment on that
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
well I'm not an expert on those
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
statistics but my sense is that there's
 
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
a waiting list of transplants to be done
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
and I would say wait two years wait
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
three years and see if the number of
 
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
donated kidneys my understanding is the
 
01:27:11.169 --> 01:27:11.179 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
donated kidneys is going a live kidneys
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
is going up and the number of deceased
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
kidney donations is going down now that
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
may initially not affect the number of
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
actual transplants done but we'll have
 
01:27:30.649 --> 01:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
to see over time what a diminished
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
number of donations do if that occurs
 
01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
um if any data that you could provide
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful well so I'm just
 
01:27:42.169 --> 01:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
looking at numbers right here I'll see
 
01:27:44.209 --> 01:27:44.219 align:start position:0%
what I can do thank you can't guarantee
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
right yes okay next up is Jeffrey Salo
 
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
who I understand is if I'm a member of
 
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
I should be good at reading bad
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
handwriting thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee it is an
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
honor and a pleasure to be here uh for
 
01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Jeffrey salloway I
 
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
am an Emeritus member of uh this
 
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
committee having served three terms
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I am also professor emeritus at the
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
um prior to that I was at Rush Medical
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
Center in Chicago where one of my main
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
responsibilities was organ procurement
 
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
research at the time there were three
 
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
National famous names in organ
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
procurement research one was a team from
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
Brandeis the other was Roberta Simmons
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
from Minnesota and you can guess who the
 
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
third one was that was me in case it was
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
an obvious representative Leon if you'll
 
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
be gentle with me as we go through this
 
01:28:59.689 --> 01:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
um there um as you have been told the
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
demand for organs runs to six figures
 
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
the supply of organs is relatively
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
modest for figures the biggest problem
 
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
is Oregon procurement organ procurement
 
01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
is done by transplant surgeons we have
 
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
one transplant team here in New
 
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under the old rules of eunos
 
01:29:27.129 --> 01:29:27.139 align:start position:0%
the United Network for organ sharing
 
01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
the first priority for harvested organs
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
for procured organs was to the patients
 
01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:38.219 align:start position:0%
of the transplant surgeon who procured
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
the organs and made perfectly good sense
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
and this was a major incentive for a
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
transplant surgeon to run an active
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
procurement program get me organs for my
 
01:29:52.729 --> 01:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
patients because frankly my friends
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
organ procurement for a trained
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
transplant surgeon is really not the fun
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
part of the job the fun part of the job
 
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
is transplanting that organ into a
 
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
patient and if you've got a patient
 
01:30:04.669 --> 01:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
who's waiting for an organ you want to
 
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
go out there and you want to procure
 
01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:08.219 align:start position:0%
organs and get them okay first priority
 
01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:11.219 align:start position:0%
patient of the procuring surgeon second
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
prior priority
 
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
a colleague within the organ procure
 
01:30:17.689 --> 01:30:17.699 align:start position:0%
within the transplant program at the
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
medical center where that surgeon
 
01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
practices this meant that if a medical
 
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:25.139 align:start position:0%
center put together a team for a
 
01:30:25.139 --> 01:30:26.390 align:start position:0%
center put together a team for a
transplant

01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
transplant
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
all the colleagues on that team wanted
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
their fellows to go out and procure
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
organs and that provided a supply of
 
01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
organs for those colleagues as well
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
third priority local region so I was in
 
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
Chicago we had five transplant services
 
01:30:47.930 --> 01:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
in Chicago everybody in Chicago worked
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
together as colleagues to procure organs
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
we were doing the best we could to
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
enhance the supply of organs great going
 
01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
enhance the supply of organs great going
okay

01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
under and after that after Regional
 
01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
distribution we went to a national
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
system and that's where eunos came in
 
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
okay now we go to the new rules and
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
under the new rules if you were a
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat in Washington I thank
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
goodness that you are not if you were a
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat in Washington you would look
 
01:31:22.970 --> 01:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
at the epidemiological demand for organs
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
and you would say in New York City in
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
New Haven in Hartford we've got a huge
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
demand okay and we have a huge demand
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
because we have a minority population a
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
poor population where the epidemiologic
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
need is substantially higher than a
 
01:31:43.689 --> 01:31:43.699 align:start position:0%
place like New Hampshire so as a result
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
organs will tend to gravitate to where
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
the demand is under the new rules driven
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
by the epidemiology
 
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
what that means is
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
our transplant surgeons will have less
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
access locally to the organs that they
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
want to transplant take a look at the
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
disincentive here this means that our
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
transplant surgeons
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't have the organs to transplant and
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
folks that's the fun part of their job
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
okay if and you may know it was
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned because you're not wrapping up
 
01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
sir yes the only
 
01:32:22.129 --> 01:32:22.139 align:start position:0%
program we have here in New Hampshire is
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
kidney we don't have heart we don't have
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
liver the reason why we we recruited to
 
01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Jacques McCullough a heart
 
01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:30.780 align:start position:0%
transplant surgeon from New Jersey and
 
01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
he has never gotten the program of heart
 
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
transplant that he was promised and the
 
01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
reason why is that those organs the
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
hearts are disappearing they're not
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
there he doesn't know the fellow
 
01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
fellowship program doesn't have the
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
program my friends we take care of one
 
01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
another we are New Hampshire we're
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
different we don't root for the Yankees
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
we don't root for the Giants we don't
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
root for the Knickerbockers okay we are
 
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we take care of one
 
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
another you've now lived through several
 
01:32:59.930 --> 01:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
days of miserable snow and one of the
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
things that you saw was the messages on
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
your phone and on your email that said I
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
have a spare bedroom if you need a place
 
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
to stay come because we are in New
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're different we're not New
 
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
York we're not new Connecticut we take
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
care of one another first this bill is a
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
nice step in that direction thank you
 
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
very much questions if you have them
 
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions from
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
Professor soloway
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Freight is how lovely to
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
see you
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.310 align:start position:0%
 
together

01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.689 --> 01:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
did you have a question or oh okay okay
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative kofault
 
01:33:50.090 --> 01:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
so am I to understand
 
01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:50.870 align:start position:0%
so am I to understand
um

01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:53.209 --> 01:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
representative saloway thank you Mr
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for for coming to
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
testify representative
 
01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
am I to understand then that that
 
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we are not able to
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
develop organ transplant programs to the
 
01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
extent that we other might otherwise
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
if we if we had a bill like this in
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
place as usual representative you are
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
okay that was quick any other questions
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much ladies and gentlemen
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman is
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
um isn't one other reason we don't have
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
them in New Hampshire because
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
we really don't have the the volumes to
 
01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
justify a system even if the organs
 
01:34:50.209 --> 01:34:50.219 align:start position:0%
were available there is there is a
 
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
demand but it goes out of town so we
 
01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
heard from a witness who had a heart
 
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
transplant at Tufts which has a major
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
transplant program we've got a number of
 
01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
them in Boston and we dare I say leak uh
 
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.649 --> 01:35:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.659 --> 01:35:10.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
and uh what appears to be the last card
 
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
I have is
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
Aaron Kutcher
 
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
I'm reading the reading it correctly
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
by the way um as I've mentioned as I've
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh representative Leon I've
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
got to get some cataract surgery later
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
on in February so if I miss you or
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
misread your name that's why it's not on
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
purpose so welcome
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
all right is this on
 
01:35:44.689 --> 01:35:44.699 align:start position:0%
all right I'm Erin Contino sorry for the
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
messy handwriting
 
01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:48.179 align:start position:0%
um and I oppose the spell
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
when I was six months old I had a virus
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
attack my heart which caused me to go
 
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
into heart failure and for a year of my
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
life I went through medical trials
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
eventually my heart was functioning at
 
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
one percent and I was placed on the
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
waitlist for a heart transplant I had a
 
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
mirror 24 hours to get a heart or else I
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
would die
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
my case was unique where I was so sick
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
they were able to go outside of the
 
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
normal range and match me with heart in
 
01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.070 align:start position:0%
normal range and match me with heart in
Missouri

01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
Missouri
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
as it stands today organs are given to
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
the sickest person and in November of
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
1996 that person was me
 
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
the spell aims to allow organs based on
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
state borders and in doing so it would
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
deprive the neediest person of a
 
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
life-saving transplant and I feel this
 
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
bill is short-sighted
 
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
as you've heard in New Hampshire there's
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
one transplant center in the state and
 
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
it only focuses on limited organs this
 
01:36:37.729 --> 01:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
automatically excludes a large
 
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
population of recipients and those in
 
01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:40.669 align:start position:0%
population of recipients and those in
waiting

01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
as a small state with already limited
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
medical resources this will drive people
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
to receive care elsewhere and I count my
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
blessings every day that this limitation
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
did not exist in 1996 or else I wouldn't
 
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
be here today
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have gotten married welcomed
 
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
my nieces and nephews and most recently
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
become a mother myself
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
the concept of organ hoarding undermines
 
01:37:02.209 --> 01:37:02.219 align:start position:0%
the primary premise of organ donation
 
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
which is altruism as a final Act of a
 
01:37:05.689 --> 01:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
person's life
 
01:37:08.209 --> 01:37:08.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh are you taking
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
questions or sure any questions for the
 
01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.090 align:start position:0%
questions or sure any questions for the
uh

01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
lady here
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well thank you very much for coming
 
01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:20.219 align:start position:0%

the expert on the issues that

necessitated this bill
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
I would like to introduce Linda Jordan
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%

she approached me with the very
 
01:38:43.370 --> 01:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
disturbing details of why this bill was
 
01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
necessary back in the spring of 2021 and
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
with that I will turn it over to Ms
 
01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:49.550 align:start position:0%

01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%

okay thank you good morning nice to be
here

01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
the seeds for the creation of this bill
 
01:38:58.850 --> 01:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
were planted more than two decades ago
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the circumstances that
 
01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
allowed and promoted the breakdown of
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
care that caused this death remain today
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
in 2001 Michael Burley a resident of New
 
01:39:13.129 --> 01:39:13.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire age 26 was to become the
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
youngest ever chief engineer for Global
 
01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
for the global Oil Corporation in their
 
01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:19.250 align:start position:0%
for the global Oil Corporation in their
history

01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
in early February 2001 Michael's
 
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
accident occurred it took less than 10
 
01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
minutes for the ambulance to arrive and
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
the hospital was only five minutes away
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
he sported a shaved head worn earring
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
was on a motorcycle was from out of
 
01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.350 align:start position:0%
was on a motorcycle was from out of
state

01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:39:39.169 --> 01:39:39.179 align:start position:0%
and had organ donor designation on his
 
01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire driver's license
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
there were many substandard missteps by
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
multiple Health Care Professionals that
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
met the legal criteria for malpractice
 
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
there were also unseen motivating
 
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
incentives the ins in the institution's
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
business structure that allowed greed to
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
had this bill been in place in 2001 the
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
additional layer of accountability it
 
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
provides would have altered Michael's
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hospital course of care and blocked the
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
tragic outcome
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that this summation has left
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
you with more questions than answers and
 
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for that I have little doubt
 
01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
that the whole story will be told on
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
film if not in print fairly soon it must
 
01:40:24.770 --> 01:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
be told
 
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
the purpose of hb47 is to save lives the
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
enactment of this measure would assure
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
that victims of traumatic injury injury
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
would assure victims of traumatic injury
 
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
that they will receive the best possible
 
01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
possible care as attempts are made to
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
save their life
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
this will increase the number of
 
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
citizens willing to be registered as
 
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
organ donors
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
the greatest number of viable organ
 
01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
donors and tissues are harvested from
 
01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
victims of trauma
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
every minute counts in trauma this is
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
why Advanced Trauma Life Support
 
01:40:59.159 --> 01:41:00.709 align:start position:0%
why Advanced Trauma Life Support
protocols

01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
were developed and instituted they
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
provide a method that is immediate for
 
01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:06.659 align:start position:0%
the immediate management of
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
traumatically injured patients the
 
01:41:11.689 --> 01:41:11.699 align:start position:0%
approach is systematic and concise as
 
01:41:14.209 --> 01:41:14.219 align:start position:0%
well as safe reliable and and the
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
accepted standard of practice
 
01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
for more than more than a hundred
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
thousand people are waiting for an organ
 
01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
as you've heard many times today more
 
01:41:24.169 --> 01:41:24.179 align:start position:0%
than a hundred thousand people are
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
waiting for an organ transplant in the
 
01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
United States the majority of these
 
01:41:30.189 --> 01:41:30.199 align:start position:0%
people will die on the waiting list
 
01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
95 percent of Americans are in favor of
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
organ donation yet only 58 are actually
 
01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.729 align:start position:0%
organ donation yet only 58 are actually
registered

01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
registered
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
we can increase the number of citizens
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
willing to register as an organ donor
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
by diminishing the fear that underpins
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
the hesitancy
 
01:41:49.609 --> 01:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
if I have if I have organ donor on my
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
and I receive the BET am I going to
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
receive the best care
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
to save my life when I need it
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
if I'm out of town and I get injured and
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
there's someone somebody on the organ
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
donor list that everybody knows are they
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
going to do everything to save my life
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
this bill when enacted will give
 
01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:09.770 align:start position:0%
this bill when enacted will give
assurances

01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
assurances
 
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
to the public that the expectation of
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
Best Care is reasonable and that those
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for making the decisions in
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
critical moments will be held
 
01:42:18.719 --> 01:42:20.090 align:start position:0%
critical moments will be held
accountable

01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
this will be done through legislation to
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
add a signature page to the medical
 
01:42:26.330 --> 01:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
record in order for the remains to be
 
01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
deemed eligible for organ or tissue
 
01:42:28.619 --> 01:42:29.750 align:start position:0%

through a mandated one-page document

added to the permanent medical records

of all donors the objectives of this
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill will be accomplished

appropriate atls protocols were fully

implemented in their attempts to save

01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
it was put in really hard to shed some
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate the efforts that

01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
but with this testimony I'm respectfully

but with this testimony I'm respectfully
asking

01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
that this committee recommend interim
 
01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:51.659 align:start position:0%
study for this bill
 
01:43:53.689 --> 01:43:53.699 align:start position:0%
let me tell you why
 
01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
I've served in many and and varied roles
 
01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
in over 50 years
 
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
in nursing I and my colleagues have been
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
really overwhelmed with grief and
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
despair at what we are seeing
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
the health care delivery system of our
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
local hospitals and committees and
 
01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.010 align:start position:0%
local hospitals and committees and
communities

01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:44:14.689 --> 01:44:14.699 align:start position:0%
have collapsed
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
the community's nursing support
 
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
structures visiting nurses hospice have
 
01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
burst at the seams
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
the global pandemic has indeed pushed
 
01:44:26.169 --> 01:44:26.179 align:start position:0%
all of the stressed pre-pran pandemic
 
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
infrastructures of Health Care over the
 
01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:29.750 align:start position:0%
infrastructures of Health Care over the
edge

01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
edge
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough trained doctors and
 
01:44:33.169 --> 01:44:33.179 align:start position:0%
nurses to answer the needs of our
 
01:44:33.179 --> 01:44:34.430 align:start position:0%
nurses to answer the needs of our
population

01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
this is a global crisis Nationwide
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
nursing schools lack educators in excess
 
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
of 80 000 potential nursing students
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
have been rejected because there are no
 
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
teachers to instruct them
 
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
in the news we have only seen
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
smatterings of how just how serious this
 
01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.470 align:start position:0%
smatterings of how just how serious this
is

01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
recently I have witnessed this breakdown
 
01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:57.659 align:start position:0%
firsthand in our emergency rooms in
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
hospitals in doctors offices in the
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
homes of the unwell
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
it is tragic and screaming for attention
 
01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:06.179 align:start position:0%
and resolution
 
01:45:08.689 --> 01:45:08.699 align:start position:0%
in light of this crisis situation I have
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
come to believe that as important as HB
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
47 is to saving lives it is not Timely
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
our current system cannot implement or
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
sustain the very minimal tasks that the
 
01:45:23.209 --> 01:45:23.219 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill would require one
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
additional page on the medical record
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
and three additional signatures would be
 
01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
too much
 
01:45:32.209 --> 01:45:32.219 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms are overrun people are
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
in dire need and waiting an average of 6
 
01:45:37.129 --> 01:45:37.139 align:start position:0%
to 12 hours to be seen
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
then they are placed in packed hallways
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
waiting for beds for another 6 to 12
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
hours when admitted to the hospitals
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
patient did not receive the basics of
 
01:45:46.729 --> 01:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
good care
 
01:45:50.209 --> 01:45:50.219 align:start position:0%
help to the bathroom washing setups bed
 
01:45:53.050 --> 01:45:53.060 align:start position:0%

01:45:55.129 --> 01:45:55.139 align:start position:0%
necessary medical testing and
 
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
interventions appropriate discharge
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate discharge planning and
 
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
coordination with either VNA or hospice
 
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians are not even
 
01:46:07.129 --> 01:46:07.139 align:start position:0%
notified that their patients have been
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
admitted to the hospital
 
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
Hospital medical records no longer
 
01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
automatically find their way to the
 
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Physician's office
 
01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
it is almost impossible to get a
 
01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
specialist appointment regardless of the
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
severity of need most are unavailable
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
for three to six months
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
or more
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
to many in many instances the delay
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
takes lives
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
please may our coming together on this
 
01:46:32.689 --> 01:46:32.699 align:start position:0%
organ donor issue also serve as a
 
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
catalyst to get us thinking about the
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
important questions to be asked and a
 
01:46:39.370 --> 01:46:39.380 align:start position:0%
call to action for practical change
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
where are we how did we get here where
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
do we need to go and how do we get there
 
01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
how do we change Healthcare education to
 
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the current and future
 
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.770 align:start position:0%

knowledge science and technology in new
 
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
ways I asked this body and all of you
 
01:47:10.609 --> 01:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
present to have the eyes to see and the
 
01:47:13.129 --> 01:47:13.139 align:start position:0%
ears to hear the crying of our world at
 
01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
this most critical moment
 
01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
I ask each of you with your positions of
 
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
influence to open your hearts and
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
dedicate your awareness to these issues
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
none among you will avoid the suffering
 
01:47:27.290 --> 01:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
rooted in this dilemma
 
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
we must join together we must Foster and
 
01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:31.739 align:start position:0%
promote Innovation integrated with
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
time-tested experience and wisdom
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
we have no choice but to develop a new
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
paradigm of Health Care delivery
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
we need not pull the covers up over our
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
heads and hide there is hope there are
 
01:47:48.649 --> 01:47:48.659 align:start position:0%
many who have been working to fix much
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
of this isolated in small corners and
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
large places in private practices
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
institutions organizations corporations
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
and universities many of these possess
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
essential pieces of the puzzle it's time
 
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
to bring them together our very lives
 
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
depend on it I respectfully and humbly
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%

distribute them
um

01:48:24.490 --> 01:48:24.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.649 --> 01:48:30.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
taking this question I know you
 
01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:33.410 align:start position:0%
taking this question I know you
um

01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
you pivoted away from your initial
 
01:48:38.649 --> 01:48:38.659 align:start position:0%
discussion about this bill to a larger
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
concern about our health care System but
 
01:48:42.590 --> 01:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
if we can go back to the initial
 
01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
discussion about the bill
 
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:45.950 align:start position:0%
discussion about the bill
um

01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:48.179 align:start position:0%
you know in my short time in the house
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
I've become wary of passing laws because
 
01:48:57.649 --> 01:48:57.659 align:start position:0%
of an anecdote or a series of anecdotes
 
01:48:57.659 --> 01:48:59.030 align:start position:0%
of an anecdote or a series of anecdotes
so

01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:02.090 --> 01:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
um the implication that um
 
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
people will not get the proper Medical
 
01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:05.330 align:start position:0%
people will not get the proper Medical
Care

01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
Care
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
um because it's an incentive to harvest
 
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
their organs is a pretty um yes that's
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
quite a charge and I wonder if other
 
01:49:19.850 --> 01:49:19.860 align:start position:0%
than the anecdote that you referenced
 
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
without detail if there is any data that
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
you're aware of or any kind of um
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
longitudinal information that would lead
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
us to know whether this is really a
 
01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.709 --> 01:49:39.719 align:start position:0%
I mean incentives
 
01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
that were built into the business
 
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
structures of some facilities and it
 
01:49:45.770 --> 01:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
exists in many others as well
 
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
where there is
 
01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
there's a kickback
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
that goes to the heads and particularly
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
at Community Hospitals there's a
 
01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
kickback that goes to the com to the
 
01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
heads of specific departments
 
01:50:02.810 --> 01:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
um for the monies that are brought into
 
01:50:05.149 --> 01:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
Community Hospitals because they don't
 
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
show a profit they just expand as they
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
grow let's let's try to keep it as
 
01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
focused on the bill as possible I'm
 
01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
trying I know it's a huge issue and a
 
01:50:16.729 --> 01:50:16.739 align:start position:0%
huge topic okay there are structures
 
01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
within the system that do
 
01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:23.699 align:start position:0%
um incentivize people not necessarily
 
01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
getting the care so that their organs
 
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant and this
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
would fix that
 
01:50:36.770 --> 01:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
it would just wipe it right out it's a
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you Mr chairman for
 
01:50:40.370 --> 01:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
and also thank you for taking the
 
01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:41.450 align:start position:0%
and also thank you for taking the
question

01:50:41.450 --> 01:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
I like representative Shapiro I'm
 
01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
struggling here
 
01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
struggling here
um

01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is troublesome and it's
 
01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
looking at and saying
 
01:50:55.729 --> 01:50:55.739 align:start position:0%
our health care professional particular
 
01:50:55.739 --> 01:50:57.169 align:start position:0%
our health care professional particular
Physicians

01:50:57.169 --> 01:50:57.179 align:start position:0%
Physicians
 
01:50:59.810 --> 01:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
are putting their oath to the patient
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
aside for a business reason
 
01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
in saying that
 
01:51:06.410 --> 01:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
is the place of this to be
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
resolved in a court of law from a
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
liability point of view and not
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
regulating Medical Practice I just we
 
01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
have so many things please let me finish
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
we have so many things going on if you
 
01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:18.890 align:start position:0%
we have so many things going on if you
will

01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:21.659 align:start position:0%
within the Health Care system to as you
 
01:51:24.169 --> 01:51:24.179 align:start position:0%
said before to Overlay this onto them I
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
struggle with it so would it not be more
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this to be dealt with in
 
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
a court of law from a liability point of
 
01:51:33.169 --> 01:51:33.179 align:start position:0%
view if somebody's not living up their
 
01:51:35.570 --> 01:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
oath if you will thank you
 
01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.070 align:start position:0%
oath if you will thank you
okay

01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:38.330 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:41.209 --> 01:51:41.219 align:start position:0%
yes and no actually what I'm saying this
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
is not it's not a legal issue what it is
 
01:51:45.890 --> 01:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
is just bringing attention
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
to the reality that if someone
 
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
if anyone on the Trump team knows hey I
 
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
gotta sign a paper that says I've done
 
01:51:56.410 --> 01:51:56.420 align:start position:0%
everything I can do to support the ALS
 
01:51:59.209 --> 01:51:59.219 align:start position:0%
protocols that's going to bring more
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
attention and they will put more
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
attention on it this wouldn't have
 
01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
fallen through the cracks if that was
 
01:52:07.070 --> 01:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
there it's not that the health care
 
01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
practitioners are doing anything and
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
that are they are Sinister it's just
 
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
that this would put a line of defense
 
01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
that would have blocked that from
 
01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:18.590 align:start position:0%
that would have blocked that from
occurring

01:52:18.590 --> 01:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:52:23.090 --> 01:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
did you help me go ahead
 
01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
hi um I've been a doctor for 35 years
 
01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:27.830 align:start position:0%
hi um I've been a doctor for 35 years
now

01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
um if I could count the number of times
 
01:52:31.609 --> 01:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
somebody told me that I just needed to
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
sign one more form I can't hear you I'm
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
sorry I've been a physician for 35 years
 
01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
now and I I if I could count the number
 
01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
of times somebody's asked me to say it's
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
just one more form I need to sign which
 
01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
then creates the problem that you just
 
01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
said that now my swivel chair is not
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
facing the patient it's facing the other
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
direction my my priorities are in the
 
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
wrong place and I'm really concerned
 
01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:58.139 align:start position:0%
that having trauma peoples sign just
 
01:52:59.810 --> 01:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
another form
 
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
is number one it's not going to
 
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
accomplish much because we are held
 
01:53:06.250 --> 01:53:06.260 align:start position:0%
liable to ethical standards already
 
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
I have to document everything I do
 
01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
everything is written down in the
 
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
medical record that I've done for this
 
01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
patient and that the medical board has
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
access to that if need be so what I'm
 
01:53:19.129 --> 01:53:19.139 align:start position:0%
struggling is why this would change
 
01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
anything and secondly
 
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
why would that affect organ procurement
 
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay which is why we're here why would
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
that would that change anything number
 
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
one we changed all the medical records
 
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
predominantly throughout the country to
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
the computer generated medical record in
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
2001. and when we made that change it
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
shifted a lot of
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
attention in a lot of ways and I can say
 
01:53:47.689 --> 01:53:47.699 align:start position:0%
that as a nurse it became let me just
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
fill in this box let me just do this and
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
it altered Medical Care
 
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm not so sure it's a good thing
 
01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.490 align:start position:0%
and I'm not so sure it's a good thing
um

01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.129 --> 01:54:01.139 align:start position:0%
but that's another Point what I'm what
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
I'm saying here is because we have
 
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
now have this automated record the fact
 
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
that this would have a signature on it
 
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
rather than a checked box is something
 
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
that says wait maybe I need to make a
 
01:54:17.689 --> 01:54:17.699 align:start position:0%
little bit more sure of this in the rush
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing that we're meeting
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
the protocols in this particular case
 
01:54:25.729 --> 01:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
there were at least seven people who
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
just got lost in the process
 
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
and had this been at the end it would
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
just bring awareness to it and how would
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
it increase the organ procurement there
 
01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
are a lot of people that won't put organ
 
01:54:42.350 --> 01:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
donor on their license because they have
 
01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
just these fears that I stated earlier
 
01:54:48.169 --> 01:54:48.179 align:start position:0%
that say hey am I going to get the best
 
01:54:48.179 --> 01:54:49.430 align:start position:0%
that say hey am I going to get the best
treatment

01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
this took place at one of the top organ
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
doning facilities in the country that's
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
not the case everywhere else but the
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
bottom line is there are still people
 
01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
that are afraid to get organ donor on
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
their license because they're not sure
 
01:55:04.729 --> 01:55:04.739 align:start position:0%
if they're going to get the best care so
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
let's give them additional
 
01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
accountability and say you know what
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
we're doing this this this piece of
 
01:55:13.250 --> 01:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
paper is there trauma teams are are made
 
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
aware of this and Trauma data and
 
01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
they're thinking more about it to just
 
01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
make them feel comfortable okay I took
 
01:55:22.729 --> 01:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
it off my license after I worked on this
 
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions yes go
 
01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:27.050 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions yes go
ahead

01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:27.060 align:start position:0%

01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman is it current law
 
01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
that um a physician has to legally

legally obey Advanced Trauma Life
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
Support protocols right now is it
 
01:55:43.850 --> 01:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
current law that they have to legally do
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
it is for trauma teams they are trauma
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
it's their they're required it's their
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
standard of care it's not a law
 
01:55:55.609 --> 01:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
it's not a law okay
 
01:55:58.090 --> 01:55:58.100 align:start position:0%
care or not law s other questions for
 
01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:01.080 align:start position:0%

um once again Alexander Raja
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
I probably still didn't pronounce that
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
correctly from the New England donor
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
Services New England donut Services yes
 
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:27.300 align:start position:0%

testimony and again rather than repeat
 
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
that I want to hit on a couple of key
 
01:56:37.070 --> 01:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
points here as you know New England
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
donor Services is the charitable
 
01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:40.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofit responsible for coordinating
 
01:56:43.129 --> 01:56:43.139 align:start position:0%
organ donation and the last bill we were
 
01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
talking about organ allocation this bill
 
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
is the first part of the process which
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
is identifying that there are potential
 
01:56:52.129 --> 01:56:52.139 align:start position:0%
donors uh just to put some perspective
 
01:56:54.649 --> 01:56:54.659 align:start position:0%
on this every hospital in the U.S is
 
01:56:57.290 --> 01:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
required to refer a death that occurs in
 
01:56:59.930 --> 01:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
the hospital to their opo for New
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
England this equates to about 50 000
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
death referrals a year
 
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
however only about two percent of those
 
01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
referrals have any medical opportunity
 
01:57:12.770 --> 01:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
for organ donation there's a very strict
 
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
medical criteria and clinical screen to
 
01:57:17.689 --> 01:57:17.699 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's a suitable donor for
 
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
transplant that will result in medical
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
benefit for the transplant recipient
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
rather than any harm for example active
 
01:57:27.649 --> 01:57:27.659 align:start position:0%
cancer would be a rule out and and other
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
conditions that might make it not
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
possible for organ donation to go
 
01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
forward therefore think about a bill
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
like this and just to put some numbers
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
on it last year alone New Hampshire
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals referred nearly 5 000 deaths
 
01:57:43.970 --> 01:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
to New England donor services that was
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
in 2022 again only about two percent
 
01:57:49.010 --> 01:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
were ultimately found to be medically
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
suitable for possible organ donation
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
this would require this bill would
 
01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
require almost fifteen thousand
 
01:57:57.050 --> 01:57:57.060 align:start position:0%
signatures from emergency department
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
staff if it had been implemented at that
 
01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
time one really important point for the
 
01:58:04.129 --> 01:58:04.139 align:start position:0%
committee to know is that the donor
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
registry can only be accessed by the
 
01:58:09.649 --> 01:58:09.659 align:start position:0%
opio and that only occurs after we've
 
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
received the referral which as I
 
01:58:13.310 --> 01:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned happens after the patient has
 
01:58:15.229 --> 01:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
died this is a really important
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
protection that's put in place
 
01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and certainly here in our
 
01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
region so that emergency department
 
01:58:23.810 --> 01:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
staff do not know and do not have access
 
01:58:26.209 --> 01:58:26.219 align:start position:0%
to the registry at the time that they
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
are caring for a patient
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
aggressive care of patients in the
 
01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
emergency department is not only
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
compatible with organ donation it's
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually necessary if aggressive care
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
and appropriate trauma care is not
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
implemented then the patient dies in a
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
manner unsuitable for organ donation
 
01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
because the patient must be resuscitated
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
and on a ventilator before they pass
 
01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
away for organ donation to be a medical
 
01:58:53.330 --> 01:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity so just from a clinical
 
01:58:56.089 --> 01:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
perspective important to understand that
 
01:58:58.729 --> 01:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
aggressive trauma care in accordance
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
with best practices and medical
 
01:59:03.890 --> 01:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
standards is completely compatible with
 
01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
how we coordinate organ donation there
 
01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
are no Financial incentives for organ
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
donor hospitals to coordinate organ
 
01:59:13.609 --> 01:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
donation because again it's the opo and
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
not the hospital that coordinates the
 
01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
organ donation and with that I think I'm
 
01:59:22.010 --> 01:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have thank
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
you very much any questions for the MS
 
01:59:27.119 --> 01:59:29.629 align:start position:0%
you very much any questions for the MS
Glazier

01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair based on the
 
01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
testimony of the last witness it sounds
 
01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:35.450 align:start position:0%
testimony of the last witness it sounds
like

01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
please correct her or me if if we're
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
wrong here ATS atls Protocols are not
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
required by law and
 
01:59:46.609 --> 01:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
um if this bill were to become enacted
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
that in order to get an organ into the
 
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
donation system if if there were a
 
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
doctor or nurses that didn't follow all
 
01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
of those atls protocols and then still
 
01:59:58.669 --> 01:59:58.679 align:start position:0%
signed this they would be committing
 
02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
perjury right is that is that my
 
02:00:03.169 --> 02:00:03.179 align:start position:0%
understanding is that if they didn't and
 
02:00:04.729 --> 02:00:04.739 align:start position:0%
then and then they still turned around
 
02:00:06.169 --> 02:00:06.179 align:start position:0%
and signed it they'd be committing
 
02:00:07.850 --> 02:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
perjury whereas right now they don't
 
02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
have to sign anything it's possible that
 
02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
they're not legally
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
they're not legally forced to provide
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
etls protocols and and an organ could
 
02:00:18.770 --> 02:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
get into the system is that correct
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
um it's not exactly how I would approach
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
it as an attorney what I would say is
 
02:00:26.209 --> 02:00:26.219 align:start position:0%
that standards of care are enforced by
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
law through medical malpractice and
 
02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
liability standards So when you say that
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
the ALS protocol is not law by itself
 
02:00:36.290 --> 02:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's not law but physician missions and
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
other health care providers are held
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
accountable by law to meet medical
 
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
standards and that's done through
 
02:00:46.129 --> 02:00:46.139 align:start position:0%
malpractice and liability Provisions I'm
 
02:00:48.410 --> 02:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
not here on behalf of providers or on
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
behalf of hospitals but as an attorney I
 
02:00:52.490 --> 02:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
would say that this adds a whole new
 
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
level of liability what I'm concerned
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
about is that this will slow down organ
 
02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
donation and could very likely result in
 
02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
the loss of life-saving organ
 
02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:05.629 align:start position:0%
the loss of life-saving organ
transplants

02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
transplants
 
02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
by adding a bureaucratic step those
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
involved in the trauma care of the
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
patients are not involved in the organ
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
donation component they'd have to be
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
tracked down found they may no longer be
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
on shift and to get a physical signature
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
at that time means donation will likely
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
not happen
 
02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.070 --> 02:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:41.930 --> 02:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
next up is Lisa Patterson
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
from Concord Hospital
 
02:01:55.129 --> 02:01:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
microphone please sorry about that good
 
02:01:59.209 --> 02:01:59.219 align:start position:0%
morning morning
 
02:02:02.089 --> 02:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
um I would thank you for the privilege
 
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
of speaking to you all just as an
 
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
introduction my name is Dr Lisa
 
02:02:08.209 --> 02:02:08.219 align:start position:0%
Patterson I'm the trauma medical
 
02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
director at Concord Hospital and I've
 
02:02:13.129 --> 02:02:13.139 align:start position:0%
been a trauma surgeon my entire career
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
and my whole passion is saving lives so
 
02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
the bill proposed and the explanation I
 
02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
find offensive personally I am also atls
 
02:02:28.729 --> 02:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
instructor for 30 plus years I also
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
teach rural trauma development course in
 
02:02:34.010 --> 02:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I have a lot of
 
02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
experience in this I think that the bill
 
02:02:38.770 --> 02:02:38.780 align:start position:0%
proposed is misguided
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that it would accomplish the
 
02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
actual opposite of what was mentioned in
 
02:02:48.169 --> 02:02:48.179 align:start position:0%
terms of atls we teach this it's the
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
ABCs and permit me to just go over that
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
a little bit a stands for Airway and
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who's not breathing well gets a
 
02:02:58.850 --> 02:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
tube down their throat to help them with
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
controlling secretions and not and to
 
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
help them breathing b stands for
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
breathing so anybody who's going to be
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
an organ donor is not breathing well on
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
their own so they are automatically on a
 
02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:11.089 align:start position:0%
their own so they are automatically on a
ventilator

02:03:11.089 --> 02:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
ventilator
 
02:03:13.550 --> 02:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
C stands for circulation and you have to
 
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
support their circulation by giving them
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
fluids by giving them blood if needed
 
02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
and possibly medications to support
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
their blood pressure so that's the ABCs
 
02:03:25.250 --> 02:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
and that's the principle and as
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is standard of care this
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
is what's done in all Trauma Centers it
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
is standard practice so we don't
 
02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:36.179 align:start position:0%
document atls principles because we all
 
02:03:39.129 --> 02:03:39.139 align:start position:0%
do it so
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to accomplish just
 
02:03:44.689 --> 02:03:44.699 align:start position:0%
the opposite of decreasing the
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
um the donors that I see because of what
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
you mentioned is it's it's an extra step
 
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
in documentation the people that were
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
involved in the initial resuscitation
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
May no longer be present maybe on
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
vacation off shift and so to actually
 
02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
require this is ridiculous nurses do not
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
take atls that is a course for
 
02:04:07.870 --> 02:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
Physicians and more recently for
 
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
Advanced Care Providers and physician
 
02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.189 align:start position:0%
Advanced Care Providers and physician
assistants

02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:12.199 align:start position:0%
assistants
 
02:04:16.129 --> 02:04:16.139 align:start position:0%
and I think on a more personal note my
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
driver's license says I'm an organ donor
 
02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
and I have been saving lives my entire
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
life if I have a traumatic injury the
 
02:04:27.890 --> 02:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
most common being a devastating brain
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
injury I want all my organs to be used
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
to save lives and this bill would
 
02:04:36.649 --> 02:04:36.659 align:start position:0%
possibly cause a bureaucratic hiccup in
 
02:04:38.810 --> 02:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
this that my organs would go to waste
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
because because one of three signatures
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
was not on there and I just think that's
 
02:04:43.679 --> 02:04:45.109 align:start position:0%
was not on there and I just think that's
wrong

02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
and why is this bill only targeting
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
trauma patients because there are other
 
02:04:52.070 --> 02:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
medical conditions that lead to organ
 
02:04:54.649 --> 02:04:54.659 align:start position:0%
donation the biggest is massive Strokes
 
02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
where somebody has no chance of survival
 
02:05:00.169 --> 02:05:00.179 align:start position:0%
and they're brain dead and their organs
 
02:05:02.050 --> 02:05:02.060 align:start position:0%
are also harvested so why Target
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
patients who have a devastating
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
traumatic injuries that they cannot
 
02:05:09.530 --> 02:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
survive or they are brain dead and not
 
02:05:12.649 --> 02:05:12.659 align:start position:0%
Target others so thank you very much
 
02:05:14.450 --> 02:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you you've taken questions
 
02:05:17.209 --> 02:05:17.219 align:start position:0%
absolutely any questions for this uh
 
02:05:17.219 --> 02:05:18.770 align:start position:0%
absolutely any questions for this uh
individual

02:05:18.770 --> 02:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
yes Dr Nagel representative Nagel sorry
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:05:26.089 --> 02:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
thank you I just have a question that
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
just occurred to me that maybe for
 
02:05:29.570 --> 02:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
anybody but I'll ask good of you
 
02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:30.410 align:start position:0%
anybody but I'll ask good of you
um

02:05:30.410 --> 02:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:32.930 --> 02:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of the donor organs are not coming
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
from trauma what do you have any idea
 
02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
what percentage of donated organs
 
02:05:39.169 --> 02:05:39.179 align:start position:0%
actually come from trauma situations as
 
02:05:40.850 --> 02:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
a trauma surgeon I cannot answer that
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that the the opio system can
 
02:05:45.649 --> 02:05:45.659 align:start position:0%
answer how many come from medical
 
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
conditions there are a huge number of
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
types people who drown that are then
 
02:05:53.810 --> 02:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
brain dead massive stroke where they
 
02:05:56.450 --> 02:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
will never recover so ideal in my field
 
02:05:58.370 --> 02:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
we deal with it's predominantly those
 
02:06:01.729 --> 02:06:01.739 align:start position:0%
patients who are have a devastating uh
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
non-survivable brain injury or they have
 
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
severed their spinal cord up at the
 
02:06:08.209 --> 02:06:08.219 align:start position:0%
point where they can't breathe and
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
already at the scene they've sustained
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
what we call a hypoxic brain injury they
 
02:06:14.689 --> 02:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
can't breathe there's no Oxygen to their
 
02:06:16.910 --> 02:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
brain and they're brain dead so those
 
02:06:19.370 --> 02:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
are the types of patients that we deal
 
02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:20.810 align:start position:0%
are the types of patients that we deal
with

02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
okay next up to testify is Gina wurtzer
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:48.530 --> 02:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for having me my name is
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
Gina wurtzer I am a 26-year RN I am I've
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
been an ed Trauma Nurse for the last 24
 
02:06:58.070 --> 02:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
years I defected from New York state to
 
02:06:59.450 --> 02:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
come live in New Hampshire five years
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
ago and I do work at Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
Medical Center I am the adult trauma
 
02:07:05.570 --> 02:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
program manager I've been involved in
 
02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
the trauma care of our my new neighbors
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
my new community and I would like to
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
clarify a few points that were made
 
02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:14.089 align:start position:0%
clarify a few points that were made
today

02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:07:15.950 --> 02:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
when I first learned of this legislation
 
02:07:18.169 --> 02:07:18.179 align:start position:0%
five days ago my initial questions were
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
was the Genesis of this amendment which
 
02:07:22.370 --> 02:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
I just learned 10 minutes ago who is
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this and why before
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
advocating for or opposing anything I
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
try to understand the concerns of those
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'm supporting or in this case opposing
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
I reviewed the personal biography
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
biographies of the four gentlemen
 
02:07:37.010 --> 02:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this bill and found not one
 
02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
trauma surgeon any surgeon or emergency
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
medicine provider much less anybody with
 
02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
a medical background nor could I find it
 
02:07:45.649 --> 02:07:45.659 align:start position:0%
anywhere the background information that
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
triggered a need for a met for this
 
02:07:49.850 --> 02:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
amendment to house bill 47.
 
02:07:52.129 --> 02:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
so as I was unable to come prepared with
 
02:07:53.570 --> 02:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
a counter-argument to an unknown
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
quantity I will present a few facts and
 
02:07:56.159 --> 02:07:58.430 align:start position:0%
quantity I will present a few facts and
considerations

02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
while it is offered during an emergency
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
Medicine Residency in a general surgery
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
residency Advanced Trauma Life Support
 
02:08:07.729 --> 02:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
is not a current is not a required
 
02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
certification to remain currency
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
and there is no requirement to maintain
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to maintain current
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
certification for emergency medicine or
 
02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:18.350 align:start position:0%
certification for emergency medicine or
surgeons

02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
surgeons
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
the exceptions to this would be for
 
02:08:22.089 --> 02:08:22.099 align:start position:0%
American College of Surgeons verified
 
02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
Trauma Centers reviewed by the committee
 
02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
on trauma who have received a
 
02:08:28.129 --> 02:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
verification in an entire trauma program
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
there are only two individuals who are
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
required is a condition of verification
 
02:08:39.770 --> 02:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:42.050 --> 02:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
um individuals who are not currently
 
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
atls certified cannot possibly attest
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
that all appropriate hls protocols were
 
02:08:49.729 --> 02:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
followed and it would be fraudulent for
 
02:08:52.250 --> 02:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
them to do so these guidelines not
 
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
protocols I will verify their guidelines
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
are revised every few years so unless
 
02:09:00.649 --> 02:09:00.659 align:start position:0%
you are current you don't know
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
fact nurses do not take atls and cannot
 
02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
possibly be certified in atls I am a
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
16-year instructor of advanced trauma
 
02:09:11.689 --> 02:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
course for nurse taught by the Society
 
02:09:13.129 --> 02:09:13.139 align:start position:0%
of trauma nurses it's a completely
 
02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
separate corollary course nurses cannot
 
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
take atls
 
02:09:19.609 --> 02:09:19.619 align:start position:0%
it would be legally fraudulent for any
 
02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
nurse to document an attestation that
 
02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
atls protocols incorrect word were
 
02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:26.930 align:start position:0%
atls protocols incorrect word were
followed

02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
followed
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
the verbiage used in this amendment that
 
02:09:31.729 --> 02:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
atls protocols in quote are being
 
02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
followed as incorrect Protocols are
 
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
rigid statements they're standardized
 
02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
rules to which one must adhere
 
02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
atls is an amalgam of practice
 
02:09:43.070 --> 02:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines not protocols guidelines
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
create a framework and provide General
 
02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations for decision making
 
02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
depending on any number of variables
 
02:09:51.169 --> 02:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
being presented in a particular
 
02:09:51.179 --> 02:09:53.209 align:start position:0%
being presented in a particular
situation

02:09:53.209 --> 02:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:09:55.490 --> 02:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
and for those cases of traumatic injury
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
quote unquote to which this amendment
 
02:10:00.530 --> 02:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
refers I must emphasize that atls may
 
02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
never have been clinically indicated in
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
many of these cases
 
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
can anyone sponsoring this bill or
 
02:10:08.450 --> 02:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
anyone voting for it for that matter
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
explain to me
 
02:10:12.410 --> 02:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
when atls might have been clinically
 
02:10:17.450 --> 02:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
who makes that clinical determination
 
02:10:21.770 --> 02:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
during these critical hours and if you
 
02:10:23.930 --> 02:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
cannot tell me I suggest you rethink
 
02:10:26.089 --> 02:10:26.099 align:start position:0%
what you are proposing today
 
02:10:28.129 --> 02:10:28.139 align:start position:0%
my last consideration with all due
 
02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
respect is a medical professional I
 
02:10:31.550 --> 02:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
would expect any medical related
 
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
legislation to be sponsored by a subject
 
02:10:35.209 --> 02:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
matter expert and where that might not
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
be possible that a reasonable amount of
 
02:10:38.930 --> 02:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
research diligence and collaboration
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
with a subject matter expert be
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by those sponsoring a bill
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I need to pay better attention
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
to goings on here in Concord as a
 
02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
private citizen of New Hampshire I'm
 
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
disappointed that legislation of this
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
magnitude that actually Advocates are
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
you wrapping up yes for medical legal
 
02:10:57.530 --> 02:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
fraudulence albeit unintentional could
 
02:10:59.089 --> 02:10:59.099 align:start position:0%
be pushed through with so little regard
 
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
for facts as well as the downstream
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
consequences of denying the citizens of
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
the state the gift of life through organ
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%

have notes that I wrote down on the way
 
02:11:15.649 --> 02:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
here if you want written testimony I'd
 
02:11:16.970 --> 02:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
prefer to make it a little more
 
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
professional looking fine that's fine
 
02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:20.280 align:start position:0%

02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning is it still
 
02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
morning yes it is um I will be quick um
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Paula minihan
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
Senior vice president state government
 
02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:03.659 align:start position:0%

02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
Association representing all 26 acute
 
02:12:08.209 --> 02:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
care hospitals as well as our specialty
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals we are opposed to House Bill
 
02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:11.709 align:start position:0%
hospitals we are opposed to House Bill
47

02:12:11.709 --> 02:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
47
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
and I will not repeat what has already
 
02:12:16.070 --> 02:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
been stated but we do believe this bill
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
is not necessary and would add
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
complexities and time delays to the
 
02:12:22.729 --> 02:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
current organ donation program the
 
02:12:25.609 --> 02:12:25.619 align:start position:0%
current system is already complex and is
 
02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
which is necessary to ensure the highest
 
02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
which is necessary to ensure the highest
quality

02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
quality
 
02:12:31.129 --> 02:12:31.139 align:start position:0%
in best performing system for organ
 
02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
donations we are concerned that this
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
bill could have a negative impact on
 
02:12:37.010 --> 02:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
transplant patients preventing some
 
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
transplants from occurring I am going to
 
02:12:41.689 --> 02:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
wrap up because I know you're well
 
02:12:44.109 --> 02:12:44.119 align:start position:0%
behind and there are experts here today
 
02:12:46.729 --> 02:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
some that have already spoken including
 
02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
the trauma surgeon from Concord Hospital
 
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
as well as the trauma nurse from
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth they are the experts they I
 
02:12:55.609 --> 02:12:55.619 align:start position:0%
please listen to them these
 
02:12:57.649 --> 02:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
um this bill we are very concerned about
 
02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
and again as has been stated our
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals are under a tremendous amount
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
of Burden right now and this adds more
 
02:13:08.689 --> 02:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
burden and again unwarranted and we ask
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
that you not support this bill and I um
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time thank you
 
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
questions from MS minahan
 
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
next up to testify is Eric Martin New
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity to speak
 
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
out against House Bill 47. uh it's hard
 
02:13:45.890 --> 02:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
not to be redundant because Dr Patterson
 
02:13:47.569 --> 02:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
who we did not speak with before this
 
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
meeting had a lot of the same thoughts
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
but for background I'm almost 12-year
 
02:13:53.330 --> 02:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
trauma surgeon I do work at Dartmouth
 
02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
I'm a trauma medical director there for
 
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
the past several years in addition to
 
02:13:59.689 --> 02:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
that my roles include the New Hampshire
 
02:14:02.330 --> 02:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
chair of the tmrc the Toronto medical
 
02:14:04.430 --> 02:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
Review Committee as well as the New
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chair of the committee on
 
02:14:08.209 --> 02:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
trauma committee on trauma is a section
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the American College of Surgeons who
 
02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
developed this course in the 1970s with
 
02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
the first course being taught in 1980
 
02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
it's a course that's probably more
 
02:14:19.129 --> 02:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
intended to be focused on providers who
 
02:14:21.169 --> 02:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
have to deal with these emergencies in
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
small Urban or rural environments in
 
02:14:25.790 --> 02:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
developing countries that sought across
 
02:14:28.850 --> 02:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
the across the world so it's basic
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
principles their guidelines has been
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
said they are not protocols it's not a
 
02:14:35.089 --> 02:14:35.099 align:start position:0%
regulatory service it's an educational
 
02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
platform so I'm here speaking in much of
 
02:14:40.930 --> 02:14:40.940 align:start position:0%
my own itself as well as the college
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
that this is not really the intent of
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
what atls is as you've heard it's not
 
02:14:48.649 --> 02:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
taught to nurses and I like Dr Patterson
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
fear that as a donor on my license that
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
if I go in somewhere someone is probably
 
02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
not going to take that legal risk of
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
documenting that they followed all the
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
hls protocols and I do find it offensive
 
02:15:01.729 --> 02:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
quite honestly that I've dedicated 18
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
years of my life to save people and this
 
02:15:06.229 --> 02:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
is the concern I think there are other
 
02:15:08.089 --> 02:15:08.099 align:start position:0%
ways to overcome those concerns and
 
02:15:10.490 --> 02:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
those fears and I think those of us in
 
02:15:11.330 --> 02:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
the field
 
02:15:13.609 --> 02:15:13.619 align:start position:0%
do everything we can and I've never once
 
02:15:15.169 --> 02:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
looked at someone's wallet coming in the
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
door and I don't have the time to do
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
that because I'm trying to save their
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
life I don't care who they are what they
 
02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
are where they come from it's all the
 
02:15:25.129 --> 02:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
same to us we do everything we can and
 
02:15:26.569 --> 02:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
I'm a huge advocate for for organ
 
02:15:29.450 --> 02:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
donation but I do know that as Ms Glaser
 
02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
said that it's about the aggressive
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
resuscitation in order to first and
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
foremost save a life if that's not
 
02:15:37.609 --> 02:15:37.619 align:start position:0%
possible because of a devastating brain
 
02:15:38.990 --> 02:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
injury then maybe some good can come
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
with it
 
02:15:43.250 --> 02:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you now questions from
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:49.490 --> 02:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
this is simplistic
 
02:15:51.410 --> 02:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
but understanding from what I'm hearing
 
02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:53.109 align:start position:0%
but understanding from what I'm hearing
that

02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
the same measures that you take to save
 
02:15:57.290 --> 02:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
a life
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
are the same measures that are necessary
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
to keep organs viable for donation
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.119 --> 02:16:14.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Dr
 
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
Martin for taking my question and also
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
for your service which I know is
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes very very strenuous
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
um having spent 40 years as a trauma
 
02:16:28.250 --> 02:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
surgeon in Orthopedics serving in the
 
02:16:29.689 --> 02:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
same trauma Bays that you currently
 
02:16:32.929 --> 02:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
serve in my question is this have you
 
02:16:34.969 --> 02:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
ever though I have never have you ever
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
at any point in time when a patient
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
comes through the door via the
 
02:16:41.330 --> 02:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
helicopter or a trauma transport have
 
02:16:43.129 --> 02:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
you ever asked anybody in the trauma
 
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
team which is fairly significant
 
02:16:47.570 --> 02:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
have you ever has anybody ever come to
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
you and said change what we do alter our
 
02:16:52.610 --> 02:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
our you know treatment protocols
 
02:16:55.849 --> 02:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
regardless of ACLS or other means to
 
02:16:58.009 --> 02:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
save the patient do you ever as you
 
02:16:59.690 --> 02:16:59.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned you don't look in their wallet
 
02:17:01.250 --> 02:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
have you ever asked anybody on the
 
02:17:02.690 --> 02:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
trauma team to confirm whether or not
 
02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
they are an organ donor and then
 
02:17:07.009 --> 02:17:07.019 align:start position:0%
subsequently change the care that you
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
give the patient whatever thank you when
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
we know the patient's coming we have all
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
the right conversations about what we're
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
expecting what we're planning for we
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't talk about organ donation
 
02:17:17.929 --> 02:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
Insurance backgrounds anything it's all
 
02:17:19.310 --> 02:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
about saving that individual at that
 
02:17:20.810 --> 02:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
time we used to call it a wallet biopsy
 
02:17:22.310 --> 02:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
and we don't do that in medicine thank
 
02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:23.570 align:start position:0%
and we don't do that in medicine thank
you

02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:17:26.209 --> 02:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
and the final pink card I have Thomas
 
02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:33.589 align:start position:0%
and the final pink card I have Thomas
Lyden

02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
Lyden
 
02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.129 --> 02:17:49.139 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Thomas Lyden I'm
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
an ER doctor here in New Hampshire I
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire 18 years and
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak on behalf of the
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
medical society as well as the chapter
 
02:18:00.530 --> 02:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
of Emergency Physicians here in New
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I've also spoken to the
 
02:18:05.410 --> 02:18:05.420 align:start position:0%
emergency Nurses Association who
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
agreed that I could speak for them as
 
02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
well and we all oppose this bill I
 
02:18:13.009 --> 02:18:13.019 align:start position:0%
actually brought with me today the atls
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh it's 400 pages long it's
 
02:18:18.650 --> 02:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
there if you look up the term protocol
 
02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
it is not in here if you look at the
 
02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
term organ donation it is not in here
 
02:18:25.129 --> 02:18:25.139 align:start position:0%
managing trauma patients at a major
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
Trauma Center is very difficult managing
 
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
them at my hospital where I worked by
 
02:18:33.049 --> 02:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
myself for 12 hours Monday night is
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult so we have to have
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
some sort of guidance as to what we're
 
02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to do and that is what has
 
02:18:40.849 --> 02:18:40.859 align:start position:0%
motivated this and this is why it is so
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
useful for us in emergency medicine
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh I don't work at a Trauma Center so I
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
have to do all this by myself and this
 
02:18:50.810 --> 02:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
allows me to develop a systemic approach
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
for treating trauma and every patient I
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
see in every circumstance is different I
 
02:18:56.929 --> 02:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
will also note that in the military they
 
02:18:58.849 --> 02:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
have a completely different system for
 
02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
treating trauma this book is a 10th
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
edition they're working on the 11th
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
Edition there have been so many changes
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
over the years we need something to keep
 
02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
us up to date but this is in no way a
 
02:19:12.830 --> 02:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
strict protocol as to what to do for
 
02:19:14.929 --> 02:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
treating trauma patients
 
02:19:17.330 --> 02:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh we feel that the bill is written is
 
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and is nonsensical uh
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
certainly I would never sign something
 
02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
saying that I did everything according
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
to atls guidelines I would certainly
 
02:19:27.709 --> 02:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
sign something saying that I tried to do
 
02:19:29.570 --> 02:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
everything I could with the limited
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
resources at my hospital with a very
 
02:19:34.129 --> 02:19:34.139 align:start position:0%
difficult Health Care system and with my
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
lack of nurses but I think that goes
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
without saying every day when I come to
 
02:19:39.889 --> 02:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
work and the nurses that I work with
 
02:19:42.169 --> 02:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
they would not be willing to sign forms
 
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
such as this
 
02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
with regards to the nuts and bolts of
 
02:19:46.730 --> 02:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
what happens in the emergency department
 
02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
for trauma I think you've heard a lot
 
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
about it but in my career in New
 
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've encountered one case
 
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
where trauma patient was appropriate for
 
02:19:59.570 --> 02:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
organ donation and that decision was not
 
02:20:01.849 --> 02:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
mine to make there are other people who
 
02:20:04.969 --> 02:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
make this decision for example in
 
02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford a few months ago there were
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
four men who died in a horrific car
 
02:20:10.849 --> 02:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
accident none of those patients are
 
02:20:13.610 --> 02:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
eligible for organ donation their
 
02:20:16.190 --> 02:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
injuries were horrible their organs were
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
not perfused they received blood
 
02:20:19.490 --> 02:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
products those are not the type of
 
02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:20.750 align:start position:0%
products those are not the type of
patients

02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
those are the type of Agents we see in
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
trauma but they are not appropriate for
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
any sort of organ donation the few cases
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
that we see are people with isolated
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
head injuries and those are very rare
 
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
when those folks come in we resuscitate
 
02:20:37.849 --> 02:20:37.859 align:start position:0%
them just like anybody else but if
 
02:20:39.290 --> 02:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
they're appropriate for organ donation
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
that is not my decision I do not
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
approach the family about organ donation
 
02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
I do not look at anyone's license to see
 
02:20:48.410 --> 02:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
if they have listed as an organ donor
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
and there is nothing in my electronic
 
02:20:52.429 --> 02:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
medical record that signifies anybody as
 
02:20:54.889 --> 02:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
an organ donor having this on your
 
02:20:56.330 --> 02:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
license is something for you to think
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
about think about what you want to do
 
02:21:00.290 --> 02:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
and it really helps with people to make
 
02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
these decisions but when someone comes
 
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
into the emergency department we do not
 
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
look at any of these things it does not
 
02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
influence our decision I have no idea
 
02:21:10.849 --> 02:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
who's on the organ transplant list I
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to know who is on the organ
 
02:21:14.809 --> 02:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
transplant list I do not get any
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
Kickback from the hospital or from
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else if someone donates their
 
02:21:21.889 --> 02:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
organs I am paid you know by the hour
 
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
unfortunately okay
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Doctor a good wrap up
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
um you have anything else or any
 
02:21:32.929 --> 02:21:32.939 align:start position:0%
questions any questions yes please
 
02:21:34.969 --> 02:21:34.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
02:21:36.650 --> 02:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
taking the time to be here
 
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
um so your job is to save the life
 
02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
um whose job is it to know whether or
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
not that patient is uh on the organ
 
02:21:47.389 --> 02:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
donation list and what happens if you've
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
done your best the patient Dies who then
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
is the who then is the doctor or surgeon
 
02:21:54.349 --> 02:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to perform the surgery is
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
it not you or is it somebody else
 
02:21:58.010 --> 02:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
completely thank you it is certainly not
 
02:21:59.690 --> 02:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
me and it's certainly not someone at my
 
02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:00.650 align:start position:0%
me and it's certainly not someone at my
hospital

02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
so when someone dies in the emergency
 
02:22:03.889 --> 02:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
department I have to make two phone
 
02:22:05.389 --> 02:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
calls I have to speak to the medical
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
examiner to see if they want to get
 
02:22:08.929 --> 02:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
involved in the case if the case was in
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
any way suspicious and by definition for
 
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
most traumas those deaths are suspicious
 
02:22:16.130 --> 02:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
and the medical examiner wants to get
 
02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
involved I also call the Oregon bank and
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
I tell them that someone has died in the
 
02:22:22.610 --> 02:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
emergency department they ask a variety
 
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
of questions about the details of what
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
happened and they have a checklist which
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
they go through to see if most people
 
02:22:31.130 --> 02:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
are eligible for donation most people
 
02:22:33.530 --> 02:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
aren't they testified earlier two
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
percent I think that's would be my
 
02:22:37.610 --> 02:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
experience one to two percent and most
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
people are appropriate for donations of
 
02:22:43.309 --> 02:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
skin or corneas not their organs I do
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
not approach the family about this the
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
folks from the New England donors
 
02:22:50.210 --> 02:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
actually call the family and speak to
 
02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
them I am not involved in this in any
 
02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:55.429 align:start position:0%
them I am not involved in this in any
way

02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.439 --> 02:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:22:59.809 --> 02:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
who who then is involved in the the
 
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
transplant transplant procedure is it
 
02:23:04.910 --> 02:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
another surgeon altogether and how long
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
can bodies remain viable for transplant
 
02:23:09.770 --> 02:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
when all this backdoor paperwork is
 
02:23:11.809 --> 02:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
going on thank you yes these are
 
02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
fantastic questions but not uh quickly
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
answer unfortunately so for the ideal
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
case as I said uh
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
to be quite blunt a gunshot wound to the
 
02:23:23.210 --> 02:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
Head uh whether it's intentional or
 
02:23:26.290 --> 02:23:26.300 align:start position:0%
accidental those people if they haven't
 
02:23:28.670 --> 02:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
injured the parts of the brain the most
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
basic parts that Keep Us Alive like keep
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
our heart beating those patients are
 
02:23:34.610 --> 02:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
alive in the sense they are perfusing
 
02:23:37.250 --> 02:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
their organs their organs are kidney
 
02:23:38.929 --> 02:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
liver have no idea what has happened up
 
02:23:40.849 --> 02:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
at the head and they continue in their
 
02:23:43.010 --> 02:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
normal function you could put those
 
02:23:46.670 --> 02:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
people on a ventilator and they are in a
 
02:23:48.830 --> 02:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
sense still living their organs are not
 
02:23:52.250 --> 02:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
dying so you have a lot of time to
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
gather a team notify the organ bank but
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
people from my Hospital don't do it as a
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
medical student as part of a transplant
 
02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
team in Philadelphia and we would go all
 
02:24:03.889 --> 02:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
over the East Coast there's a system for
 
02:24:06.530 --> 02:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
calling people in and it's a very large
 
02:24:08.210 --> 02:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
team that comes in there's actually a
 
02:24:10.610 --> 02:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
team for each organ which comes in to do
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
the heart to do the lungs to do the
 
02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
kidneys in patients who die of trauma in
 
02:24:17.389 --> 02:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
the emergency department once they are
 
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
dead those organs are done lying and as
 
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
I said most of those people are not
 
02:24:24.110 --> 02:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate the heart once it doesn't
 
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
get perfused it's it's not much good
 
02:24:28.210 --> 02:24:28.220 align:start position:0%
same with the lungs as well
 
02:24:30.770 --> 02:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
if someone is appropriate
 
02:24:33.410 --> 02:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
I stay out of this the organ Bank
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
notifies the appropriate team but in my
 
02:24:38.690 --> 02:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
18 years here in New Hampshire the only
 
02:24:41.150 --> 02:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
cases we have actually obtained organs
 
02:24:44.270 --> 02:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
are from these isolated head injuries
 
02:24:45.770 --> 02:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:24:47.570 --> 02:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
other question so Dr Nagel
 
02:24:50.210 --> 02:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel sorry
 
02:24:52.370 --> 02:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:24:53.929 --> 02:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:24:53.939 --> 02:24:54.770 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:24:54.770 --> 02:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
as a point
 
02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
um we're really focused on following
 
02:25:00.889 --> 02:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
protocols guidelines whatever term you
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
want to use the um sorry the definition
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
of evidence-based medicine is the use of
 
02:25:07.849 --> 02:25:07.859 align:start position:0%
the medical literature is applied to the
 
02:25:09.650 --> 02:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances of the
 
02:25:11.330 --> 02:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
individual and I'm just really curious
 
02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
in your experience
 
02:25:16.010 --> 02:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
my world is totally flying by the seat
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
of my pants there's no protocols for
 
02:25:19.130 --> 02:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
what I do
 
02:25:22.370 --> 02:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
in your experience and Trauma how often
 
02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
do you have to deviate from best
 
02:25:27.050 --> 02:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
practice guidelines whatever you want to
 
02:25:29.929 --> 02:25:29.939 align:start position:0%
call them it really depends on the
 
02:25:33.290 --> 02:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
circumstances unfortunately I most of
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
the reason we have these guidelines is
 
02:25:36.910 --> 02:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
because trauma patients are complicated
 
02:25:38.990 --> 02:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things you'd like
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
to do all at once but if you're the only
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
doctor there you can only do one thing
 
02:25:46.610 --> 02:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
at a time so you start with like we
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
heard earlier from the person who
 
02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
actually did my last atls certification
 
02:25:52.190 --> 02:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
you start with the A's you move on to
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
the B's and then you go to the C's in
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
the military protocols for this they do
 
02:25:58.690 --> 02:25:58.700 align:start position:0%
something completely different
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
someday we'll perhaps reconcile them but
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
their first step begins with an M it's
 
02:26:05.210 --> 02:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
massive Hemorrhage so in the battlefield
 
02:26:07.370 --> 02:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
you try to stop all bleeding you know
 
02:26:08.690 --> 02:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
that's part of what we do in the
 
02:26:11.690 --> 02:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
emergence department but
 
02:26:13.309 --> 02:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
these are the guidelines
 
02:26:16.190 --> 02:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
so I wish there was a simple answer the
 
02:26:17.870 --> 02:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
philosophy of what we do to treat trauma
 
02:26:19.790 --> 02:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
patients changes all the time I could
 
02:26:20.929 --> 02:26:20.939 align:start position:0%
give you a couple example of things
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've had in the last several years that
 
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
have changed how we treat trauma
 
02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
patients but these are our guidelines
 
02:26:27.469 --> 02:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
they're probably a couple of years
 
02:26:29.809 --> 02:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
behind the research and they're a couple
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
years behind the results getting out to
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
Providers like myself so we view them as
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
a way to help us out but it's not really
 
02:26:38.570 --> 02:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
a straight jacket and it's not in any
 
02:26:40.849 --> 02:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
way medically or legally binding as to
 
02:26:42.610 --> 02:26:42.620 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
02:26:45.770 --> 02:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so I'm I'm just
 
02:26:48.050 --> 02:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
going to answer the question for you I
 
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
guess so you would and you can you can
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
say yes or no
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
um so you would feel constrained by such
 
02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
a policy that basically forced you to
 
02:27:00.170 --> 02:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
follow a guideline or a protocol well I
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's then answered any other questions
 
02:27:10.849 --> 02:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
hey thank you very much
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
I know of no one else here to testify is
 
02:27:14.990 --> 02:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
02:27:17.450 --> 02:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
okay I am closing the public hearing on
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
HB 47 then and I am opening the public
 
02:27:22.610 --> 02:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 223
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
at this time I'd like to recognize
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Dan McGuire who's been
 
02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
waiting here very very patiently for a
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
while and uh welcome representative
 
02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:33.469 align:start position:0%
while and uh welcome representative
McGuire

02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:35.389 --> 02:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman the
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:27:40.490 --> 02:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan McGuire I'm from Epsom
 
02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
um this bill is
 
02:27:45.290 --> 02:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
extremely minor maybe the most minor
 
02:27:46.670 --> 02:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
ability that you're going to hear in
 
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
this committee I don't know
 
02:27:50.090 --> 02:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
um especially you know compared to what
 
02:27:53.330 --> 02:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
I just heard so what this bill does is
 
02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
it tries to save a little money and some
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
amount of annoyance
 
02:28:02.090 --> 02:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
um for some number of patients I
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
estimate roughly 1500 but you know
 
02:28:07.610 --> 02:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
that's my back of the envelope kind of
 
02:28:10.849 --> 02:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
calculation and also some sort of make
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
work for for pharmacists so the bill
 
02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:15.490 align:start position:0%
work for for pharmacists so the bill
um

02:28:15.490 --> 02:28:15.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
is uh relates to this particular
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
medication this is um testosterone gel
 
02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
so for people that like myself have low
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
testosterone and generally our seniors
 
02:28:31.210 --> 02:28:31.220 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:28:33.950 --> 02:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
endocrinologists might might prescribe
 
02:28:36.170 --> 02:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
this and it's something that that boosts
 
02:28:39.429 --> 02:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
your testosterone somewhat and and
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
testosterone is something that for best
 
02:28:44.809 --> 02:28:44.819 align:start position:0%
health should be in some sort of a range
 
02:28:46.610 --> 02:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
and and so if you're a little below that
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
range this is a medication that can
 
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
improve it and because this is in a
 
02:28:58.190 --> 02:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
chemical category for a much uh heavier
 
02:29:00.670 --> 02:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
Duty sort of version of this medication
 
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
something that's injectable
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
um it's it's in what's called class
 
02:29:08.929 --> 02:29:08.939 align:start position:0%
three which means that patients are only
 
02:29:12.050 --> 02:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
allowed to order a month's worth of
 
02:29:13.849 --> 02:29:13.859 align:start position:0%
Supply at a time
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
so for me for example I have to put in a
 
02:29:20.349 --> 02:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
order my prescription 12 times a year
 
02:29:22.490 --> 02:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
whereas most kind of Maintenance
 
02:29:25.490 --> 02:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
medication like this that the standard
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
is you do it once per quarter so so I
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
end up
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
um with with you know eight extra
 
02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
co-pays and eight extra trips to the
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacist or in my case by mail extra
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
orders and like I said I I estimate that
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
that there's roughly somewhere between
 
02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
one and two thousand uh men in New
 
02:29:50.090 --> 02:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are in a similar
 
02:29:52.969 --> 02:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
situation so this bill just puts an
 
02:29:55.010 --> 02:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
exception so that it allows this to
 
02:29:57.950 --> 02:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
medication to be ordered uh on a normal
 
02:30:01.849 --> 02:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
90-day schedule rather than the the 34
 
02:30:06.770 --> 02:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:08.270 --> 02:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
02:30:15.530 --> 02:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:17.330 --> 02:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon
 
02:30:22.250 --> 02:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:25.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:29.570 --> 02:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
so the product as you show there is a
 
02:30:31.490 --> 02:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
30-day Supply
 
02:30:34.969 --> 02:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
it depends slightly this bottle for me
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
is good for 20 days but but the bottle
 
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
has certain it's a pump you you pump and
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
you get maybe a tablespoon of stuff and
 
02:30:46.010 --> 02:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
your prescription is between one and
 
02:30:49.250 --> 02:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
four pumps per day so there's I think 60
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
pumps in this bottle my particular
 
02:30:54.590 --> 02:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
prescription is three pumps so this is a
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
20-day supply for me so when I order it
 
02:31:02.270 --> 02:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:06.889 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead thank you Mr chair
um

02:31:06.889 --> 02:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
so it if that is only uh or or it's 20
 
02:31:14.330 --> 02:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
day or whatever
 
02:31:16.670 --> 02:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
um what's the difference between that
 
02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
product and an inhaler that I take every
 
02:31:25.429 --> 02:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
30 days and have to fill every 30 days
 
02:31:28.490 --> 02:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
um should we do this for other
 
02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
medications as well
 
02:31:34.010 --> 02:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question so I I
 
02:31:35.690 --> 02:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
um the general principle here is whether
 
02:31:40.730 --> 02:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
is how
 
02:31:44.510 --> 02:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
um sort of how abusable is the is the
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
medication right so so if you were
 
02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
taking I don't know fentanyl as a
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
prescribed medication
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a reason for
 
02:31:56.570 --> 02:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
limiting it to to a very small
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
prescription right but but
 
02:32:02.510 --> 02:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
um something like this is as I
 
02:32:04.670 --> 02:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
understand it is not really abusable
 
02:32:07.250 --> 02:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's it there's no real street value or
 
02:32:08.809 --> 02:32:08.819 align:start position:0%
something like that to this particular
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
medication I have no idea what the the
 
02:32:12.830 --> 02:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
one that you take
 
02:32:15.650 --> 02:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
you know what category it is in but I
 
02:32:16.849 --> 02:32:16.859 align:start position:0%
would assume that there's probably
 
02:32:20.090 --> 02:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
others besides this that ought to have
 
02:32:21.889 --> 02:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
similar exceptions yes and there's
 
02:32:24.290 --> 02:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
already in the law by the way uh an
 
02:32:26.450 --> 02:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
exception if you look on line nine of
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
the bill that's existing law so there's
 
02:32:31.210 --> 02:32:31.220 align:start position:0%
already an exception for this uh
 
02:32:33.849 --> 02:32:33.859 align:start position:0%
amphetamines and
 
02:32:33.859 --> 02:32:35.410 align:start position:0%
amphetamines and
methophenidate

02:32:35.410 --> 02:32:35.420 align:start position:0%
methophenidate
 
02:32:38.330 --> 02:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
hydrochloride whatever that is so you
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
know there are things in this category
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr uh representative Nagel
 
02:32:48.050 --> 02:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I don't know if
 
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
this is the better question to ask you
 
02:32:51.950 --> 02:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
or follow-ups but um can you explain to
 
02:32:54.590 --> 02:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
us why that is a schedule three drug
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
oh thank you so
 
02:32:56.399 --> 02:32:56.990 align:start position:0%
oh thank you so
um

02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:59.690 --> 02:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
as I understand it so this is in the
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
same category as steroids right so so
 
02:33:06.530 --> 02:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
the kind of steroids that help people
 
02:33:08.929 --> 02:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
hit baseballs farther and that kind of
 
02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
stuff and can be abused by bodybuilders
 
02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing it's it's in the
 
02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
same chemical category but according to
 
02:33:19.550 --> 02:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
my endocrinologist when I asked about
 
02:33:22.969 --> 02:33:22.979 align:start position:0%
this in order to abuse this particu so
 
02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
this is uh that's not the kinds that are
 
02:33:29.210 --> 02:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
abused those are injectables right this
 
02:33:31.250 --> 02:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
is something that you rub on your skin
 
02:33:33.889 --> 02:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
and so it's absorbed very very slowly
 
02:33:37.309 --> 02:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
it's not very powerful and I asked my
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
doctor uh how could you abuse this and
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
they said well maybe if you filled a
 
02:33:44.929 --> 02:33:44.939 align:start position:0%
bathtub with it you know
 
02:33:48.050 --> 02:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
and so you know this bottle is like a
 
02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars right so so you know
 
02:33:52.429 --> 02:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
nobody's gonna fill the bathtub with
 
02:33:52.439 --> 02:33:56.570 align:start position:0%
nobody's gonna fill the bathtub with
this

02:33:56.570 --> 02:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:06.410 --> 02:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:08.690 --> 02:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
next step to testify is uh
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative Gary Merchant who is a
 
02:34:12.110 --> 02:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
member of that committee representative
 
02:34:14.510 --> 02:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
welcome representative and from a
 
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
different day thank you Mr chairman
 
02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:18.290 align:start position:0%
different day thank you Mr chairman
yeah

02:34:18.290 --> 02:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:34:21.770 --> 02:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
I have some handouts I'll distribute
 
02:34:23.389 --> 02:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:34:25.610 --> 02:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
and I'll try not to read my testimony
 
02:34:27.650 --> 02:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
verbatim but I think it's important what
 
02:34:29.690 --> 02:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
I testify about it
 
02:34:31.550 --> 02:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
and again we're trying to limit it to
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:39.889 --> 02:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
this half goes over there
 
02:34:43.969 --> 02:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
I'll try to answer the questions that
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
were raised the reason why
 
02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
this is in schedule three
 
02:34:53.090 --> 02:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
it's the federal law and what it came
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
down to was back in the 1990s there was
 
02:34:57.770 --> 02:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
a problem to what president McGuire
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
talked about abuse of Androids
 
02:35:02.510 --> 02:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
um androgens if you will
 
02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
so the federal law was the basically
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
clamped down on that whole issue and
 
02:35:08.690 --> 02:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
lots of it a lot of that came down to
 
02:35:10.429 --> 02:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
his bodybuilders and people are abusing
 
02:35:10.439 --> 02:35:11.150 align:start position:0%
his bodybuilders and people are abusing
it

02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:35:13.010 --> 02:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
so I did
 
02:35:14.690 --> 02:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
sign on to this with representative
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
McGuire but I want to talk about two
 
02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
things with you folks and representative
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
Candace sort of erase it as well
 
02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
from a regulatory point of view there's
 
02:35:26.270 --> 02:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
two issues here one is abuse illicit use
 
02:35:28.429 --> 02:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
of the drug I think president McGuire
 
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
talked about that pretty clearly
 
02:35:32.210 --> 02:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
it's hard to abuse a topical product
 
02:35:35.230 --> 02:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
because it's just difficult to abuse
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
number two
 
02:35:40.190 --> 02:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
the reason why I wanted to insert the
 
02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:41.210 align:start position:0%
the reason why I wanted to insert the
phrase

02:35:41.210 --> 02:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
02:35:42.830 --> 02:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
that it's used for
 
02:35:46.010 --> 02:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
chronic testosterone inefficiency for a
 
02:35:47.389 --> 02:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
medical condition
 
02:35:50.210 --> 02:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
what many people don't realize is in the
 
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
world of Pharmacy the DEA holds the
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist equally accountable
 
02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
for the prescription for a control rug
 
02:35:59.630 --> 02:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
and what I mean by that is that if you
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
are in suspicion of a prescription being
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
written for non-medical reasons or not
 
02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons you're held
 
02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:09.770 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons you're held
accountable

02:36:09.770 --> 02:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
so in order to slow down the process a
 
02:36:13.550 --> 02:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
lot of times if you get a prescription
 
02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
you think is dubious or you think you're
 
02:36:17.090 --> 02:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
questionable you have to call the
 
02:36:19.210 --> 02:36:19.220 align:start position:0%
prescriber to verify the medical Reason
 
02:36:22.429 --> 02:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
by adding the phrase that we're talking
 
02:36:23.870 --> 02:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
about in the bill
 
02:36:26.330 --> 02:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
that it's for low chronic testosterone
 
02:36:29.330 --> 02:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
inefficiency for a medical condition it
 
02:36:30.770 --> 02:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
tells the pharmacist at that point in
 
02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
time you can in fact understand what the
 
02:36:35.330 --> 02:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
position of the prescriber is coming
 
02:36:36.770 --> 02:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
from you don't need to make the phone
 
02:36:41.389 --> 02:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
call number two when you have which also
 
02:36:44.570 --> 02:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
talks about from the DEA manual
 
02:36:46.849 --> 02:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
there's no limitations on the day supply
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
of a prescription
 
02:36:51.050 --> 02:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
so there's limitations on the refills on
 
02:36:53.809 --> 02:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
schedule three you can do it five times
 
02:36:55.730 --> 02:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
but if you're a pharmacist quite frankly
 
02:36:57.050 --> 02:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
if you've got a prescription for more
 
02:36:59.929 --> 02:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
than 180 days at one time most likely
 
02:37:01.969 --> 02:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
you're going to question it or if you
 
02:37:04.610 --> 02:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
get subsequently refills including the
 
02:37:08.090 --> 02:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
original Beyond 180 days you're probably
 
02:37:09.530 --> 02:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
going to be suspicious about what's
 
02:37:10.429 --> 02:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
going on
 
02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
so given the fact is by changing this
 
02:37:13.380 --> 02:37:14.150 align:start position:0%
so given the fact is by changing this
bill

02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
to include that phrase I think would
 
02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
help to alleviate some of the concern
 
02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
that pharmacists will have also
 
02:37:21.170 --> 02:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
communicate from the prescriber back to
 
02:37:22.969 --> 02:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
the dispenser we had something
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
comparable to this in our committee in
 
02:37:28.130 --> 02:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
2021 Dr Woods representative Woods
 
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
brought it to our attention with a
 
02:37:32.090 --> 02:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
attention deficit disorder at the same
 
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
time there was limitation of 34 days we
 
02:37:37.070 --> 02:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
were able to make a change as long as
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
the practitioner wrote on it the reason
 
02:37:41.950 --> 02:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
why they're asking for a 90-day Supply
 
02:37:44.750 --> 02:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's four attention deficit disorder
 
02:37:46.670 --> 02:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
then the pharmacist and everybody else
 
02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
understood what was going on
 
02:37:51.170 --> 02:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
so fundamentally it's a simple bill it's
 
02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
just allowing for people that are in a
 
02:37:55.550 --> 02:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
situation where they have to get a
 
02:37:58.610 --> 02:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
prescription for topical testosterone to
 
02:38:01.849 --> 02:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
logically and reasonably get it filled
 
02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:03.330 align:start position:0%
four times a year versus 12 times
 
02:38:03.330 --> 02:38:05.389 align:start position:0%
four times a year versus 12 times

[Music]
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:12.889 --> 02:38:12.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:38:14.450 --> 02:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:15.050 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:38:15.050 --> 02:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:18.170 --> 02:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
this seems to me to be while this seems
 
02:38:19.370 --> 02:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:38:21.710 --> 02:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
you know totally reasonable thing to do
 
02:38:24.410 --> 02:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if
 
02:38:27.469 --> 02:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
um from your with your background
 
02:38:29.630 --> 02:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant if there are
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
other medications within schedule three
 
02:38:34.670 --> 02:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
that this would also apply to and would
 
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
it not make sense to
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
either through a study committee or
 
02:38:41.210 --> 02:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
other means
 
02:38:41.220 --> 02:38:42.469 align:start position:0%
other means
um

02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:45.050 --> 02:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
survey all the medications that are in
 
02:38:49.550 --> 02:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
the in that classification and create
 
02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:51.590 align:start position:0%
the in that classification and create
um

02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.670 --> 02:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
create the same kind of alternative
 
02:38:57.530 --> 02:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
prescribing for those while we're doing
 
02:38:57.540 --> 02:38:59.450 align:start position:0%
prescribing for those while we're doing
this

02:38:59.450 --> 02:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
I think it's wise to
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
talk about studying the issue I would
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
not want to hold this bill up for that
 
02:39:07.790 --> 02:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
but I think one of the things we could
 
02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
do in this committee or somewhere along
 
02:39:11.690 --> 02:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
the way is to have an ad hoc group talk
 
02:39:14.510 --> 02:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
about it because there are other drugs
 
02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
that fall in the same
 
02:39:19.010 --> 02:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
category if you will where because of
 
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
the federal law the state law is what's
 
02:39:23.570 --> 02:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
controlling and not the federal law is
 
02:39:25.010 --> 02:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
that we could change and modify the
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
state law to allow for greater
 
02:39:28.730 --> 02:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
flexibility I think one of the key
 
02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
things I would say is that where becomes
 
02:39:33.650 --> 02:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
a problem is the communication between
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
the prescriber and the dispenser and it
 
02:39:38.690 --> 02:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
goes back to the DEA corresponding
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility so I do agree what you're
 
02:39:42.290 --> 02:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
saying representative sombero that we
 
02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
should probably broaden it but I would
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
not want to slow this bill down because
 
02:39:46.670 --> 02:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:51.349 --> 02:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for my
 
02:39:55.849 --> 02:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
question take my question I'm going to
 
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
be up front and say I really like bills
 
02:39:59.330 --> 02:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
like this because they increase access
 
02:40:01.130 --> 02:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
to care and that's like really important
 
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
they decrease cost and improve
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
convenience for the patient however
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
when the um the DEA looks at their
 
02:40:09.889 --> 02:40:09.899 align:start position:0%
scheduling one of the issues isn't just
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we know this from opioids and other
 
02:40:13.849 --> 02:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
things isn't just who's got the
 
02:40:16.910 --> 02:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
prescription only 10 percent of opioid
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
deaths were related to a legitimate
 
02:40:21.710 --> 02:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
prescription 90 were related to
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
illegitimate use such as a child getting
 
02:40:27.309 --> 02:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
the whatever from somebody's medicine
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
shelf or whatever
 
02:40:32.809 --> 02:40:32.819 align:start position:0%
for the record one of the companies
 
02:40:34.849 --> 02:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
Bellco in San Francisco was using
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
topical testosterone preparations and
 
02:40:40.910 --> 02:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
and and and juicing players that way so
 
02:40:43.910 --> 02:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
topicals are used what makes this
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
product different than that and I'm just
 
02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
curious what your thoughts are about
 
02:40:51.290 --> 02:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
that I think I don't know exactly which
 
02:40:53.630 --> 02:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
topical product was being utilized if it
 
02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
was actually testosterone another
 
02:40:57.950 --> 02:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
chemical deviation of it for the most
 
02:41:01.630 --> 02:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
part the ability to abuse testosterone
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
topically is a challenge the amount that
 
02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
you're required to use it doesn't mean
 
02:41:08.450 --> 02:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
it couldn't be done but that goes back
 
02:41:10.370 --> 02:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
to the onus on the prescriber if the
 
02:41:11.929 --> 02:41:11.939 align:start position:0%
prescriber is basically saying to the
 
02:41:14.450 --> 02:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
dispenser I'm giving this to the patient
 
02:41:16.250 --> 02:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
for chronic
 
02:41:18.590 --> 02:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
low testosterone based upon a medical
 
02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:19.610 align:start position:0%
low testosterone based upon a medical
condition

02:41:19.610 --> 02:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
condition
 
02:41:22.130 --> 02:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
to me that sort of helps
 
02:41:23.570 --> 02:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
deal with some of the questions you're
 
02:41:25.370 --> 02:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
talking about for abuse
 
02:41:27.290 --> 02:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
it puts the onus back on the prescriber
 
02:41:29.809 --> 02:41:29.819 align:start position:0%
to justify why they're doing it and also
 
02:41:32.450 --> 02:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
puts them on record that they're
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
doing it because of that reason so from
 
02:41:36.170 --> 02:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
a liability point of view the prescriber
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
owns a lot of the liability because
 
02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:41:45.230 --> 02:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
um so with opioids we have stringent
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have to follow to
 
02:41:49.730 --> 02:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
inform the patient about what the risk
 
02:41:51.770 --> 02:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
benefit ratios are how to handle that
 
02:41:54.170 --> 02:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
product things like that
 
02:41:57.290 --> 02:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
it I think you're I don't disagree with
 
02:41:59.570 --> 02:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
you about the the risk of performance
 
02:42:01.849 --> 02:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
enhancement with this but
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
it it does make me think that we should
 
02:42:05.630 --> 02:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
probably be providing similar
 
02:42:07.309 --> 02:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
information for patients so this is
 
02:42:09.469 --> 02:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
something that they need to
 
02:42:12.170 --> 02:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
deal with responsibly
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:20.290 --> 02:42:20.300 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I'm really sorry
 
02:42:23.290 --> 02:42:23.300 align:start position:0%
and my apologies
 
02:42:26.690 --> 02:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
I've demonstrated the problem uh the use
 
02:42:29.150 --> 02:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
of microphones closer is not only for us
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
but also for the people watching at home
 
02:42:34.370 --> 02:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
so thank you if we could all work harder
 
02:42:37.730 --> 02:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
at it I will try should I repeat or uh
 
02:42:40.010 --> 02:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
well what was your question I I heard a
 
02:42:41.090 --> 02:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
little bit of the lead up but I don't
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
show what the question was when we when
 
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
we deal with scheduled drugs we're
 
02:42:46.730 --> 02:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
talking about an increasing amount of
 
02:42:48.650 --> 02:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the person receiving
 
02:42:50.990 --> 02:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
it to not just for the provider should
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
we be providing
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
I think I'm getting a little off track
 
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm concerned because we we have
 
02:42:58.849 --> 02:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
recommendations for one class of drugs
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
and not for another should we be giving
 
02:43:04.130 --> 02:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
these patients included in this somehow
 
02:43:06.410 --> 02:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
that we need to inform them about your
 
02:43:08.570 --> 02:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that what the risks are
 
02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
how to guard this how to take care of it
 
02:43:12.050 --> 02:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
02:43:14.510 --> 02:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I would say
 
02:43:17.330 --> 02:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
there's two steps in that process one is
 
02:43:19.250 --> 02:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
the prescribers themselves informing the
 
02:43:21.050 --> 02:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
patient so they have informed consent at
 
02:43:22.190 --> 02:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
that point in time to what's being
 
02:43:24.410 --> 02:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
prescribed for them number two when you
 
02:43:26.090 --> 02:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
get to the pharmacy if you look at what
 
02:43:28.010 --> 02:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire had the pharmacy
 
02:43:30.550 --> 02:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
is also required to give you a patient
 
02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
handout a leaflet if you will which also
 
02:43:35.809 --> 02:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
goes over a lot of the risk and things
 
02:43:38.330 --> 02:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
of that nature with the drug so I think
 
02:43:41.270 --> 02:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
in that scenario dealing with a topical
 
02:43:43.849 --> 02:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
testosterone that is covered by the
 
02:43:46.730 --> 02:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
prescriber informing the patient it's
 
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
also being dealt with by the dispenser
 
02:43:50.929 --> 02:43:50.939 align:start position:0%
by providing to the patient a handout
 
02:43:53.690 --> 02:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
that clearly just finds what the risks
 
02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:54.530 align:start position:0%
that clearly just finds what the risks
are

02:43:54.530 --> 02:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:43:55.969 --> 02:43:55.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:59.570 --> 02:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:01.550 --> 02:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative
 
02:44:03.710 --> 02:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
great thank you Mr chairman uh just a
 
02:44:05.210 --> 02:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
quick question uh representative
 
02:44:05.220 --> 02:44:06.770 align:start position:0%
quick question uh representative
Merchant

02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:07.630 align:start position:0%
Merchant
um

02:44:07.630 --> 02:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:09.410 --> 02:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire said they would
 
02:44:12.170 --> 02:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
take a bathtub of this chemical or this
 
02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
product to cause abuse I guess so my
 
02:44:17.090 --> 02:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
question is why do why do we have to put
 
02:44:18.410 --> 02:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
and I think you may have answered this
 
02:44:20.690 --> 02:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
why do we have to put for the treatment
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
of chronic low testosterone replacement
 
02:44:25.610 --> 02:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
therapy versus just eliminating that and
 
02:44:28.490 --> 02:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
just say we can prescribe this drug
 
02:44:30.050 --> 02:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
because I'm not really aware of are
 
02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
there other indications for this drug
 
02:44:33.889 --> 02:44:33.899 align:start position:0%
and if so would they have the potential
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
for abuse or why do we have to be
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
specific I guess is for this diagnosis
 
02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:39.590 align:start position:0%
specific I guess is for this diagnosis
only

02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:44:42.349 --> 02:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
it's a good question I would say the
 
02:44:44.929 --> 02:44:44.939 align:start position:0%
reason I'm adding that is to eliminate
 
02:44:46.490 --> 02:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
the phone call coming from the pharmacy
 
02:44:49.610 --> 02:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
or the pharmacist to the prescriber is
 
02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's a way of communicating between the
 
02:44:52.490 --> 02:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
two parties
 
02:44:54.650 --> 02:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
to allow them to understand that would
 
02:44:56.809 --> 02:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
be giving a 90-day Supply
 
02:44:59.270 --> 02:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
that it's for a chronic condition linked
 
02:45:01.250 --> 02:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
to a medical condition
 
02:45:04.610 --> 02:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
however I'd be not opposed to taking it
 
02:45:06.410 --> 02:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
out but I think it would open up more
 
02:45:08.870 --> 02:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
phone calls between the dispenser and
 
02:45:10.490 --> 02:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
the prescriber and I'm trying to
 
02:45:13.070 --> 02:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate that I understood thank you
 
02:45:16.429 --> 02:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:18.469 --> 02:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
and if you also will notice inside of
 
02:45:21.770 --> 02:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
the way I in my testimony
 
02:45:24.170 --> 02:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
um I did change the language in there
 
02:45:25.730 --> 02:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
and I will bring back an amendment to
 
02:45:28.490 --> 02:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
the Committees to look at so they can
 
02:45:31.070 --> 02:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
review it I changed it to including a
 
02:45:33.889 --> 02:45:33.899 align:start position:0%
medical condition in there and that way
 
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
there it's linked back to a reason why
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
you're prescribing for it in the first
 
02:45:37.439 --> 02:45:38.210 align:start position:0%
you're prescribing for it in the first
place

02:45:38.210 --> 02:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:45:39.889 --> 02:45:39.899 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to get into which
 
02:45:41.630 --> 02:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
medical conditions just that in your
 
02:45:44.210 --> 02:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
professional opinion is linked to a
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
medical reason which goes back to the
 
02:45:46.969 --> 02:45:46.979 align:start position:0%
corresponding responsibility of the
 
02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacist's faces you have to take this
 
02:45:50.990 --> 02:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
seriously because
 
02:45:53.929 --> 02:45:53.939 align:start position:0%
as you all know Walmart Walgreens and so
 
02:45:56.990 --> 02:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
forth settled with the DEA for several
 
02:45:59.090 --> 02:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
because then their opinion people
 
02:46:03.170 --> 02:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
weren't taking it seriously so when the
 
02:46:04.969 --> 02:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
DEA comes knocking on your door and it's
 
02:46:06.770 --> 02:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
happened to me not because they're
 
02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
looking at me from a broad point of view
 
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
but they wanted to talk to me about
 
02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
something else we're doing as a model
 
02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
um it sends chills down your spine when
 
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
they take out that badge and it's coming
 
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
from the de office
 
02:46:20.809 --> 02:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
um you take it very seriously
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
Christian so again thank you
 
02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:26.270 align:start position:0%
Christian so again thank you
Representatives

02:46:26.270 --> 02:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
02:46:28.490 --> 02:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
Merchant and McGuire for your testimony
 
02:46:30.770 --> 02:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
and for this bill
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh is there anyone else here to testify
 
02:46:35.929 --> 02:46:35.939 align:start position:0%
on HB 223
 
02:46:37.490 --> 02:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I am going to close the
 
02:46:40.370 --> 02:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 223 and open the
 
02:46:43.490 --> 02:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 397.
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'd recognize the prime sponsor
 
02:46:55.490 --> 02:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
good morning representative Phillips
 
02:46:58.969 --> 02:46:58.979 align:start position:0%
this is my first bill so let's see how
 
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
this goes
 
02:47:03.530 --> 02:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
um this legislation is basically to
 
02:47:05.330 --> 02:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
decriminalize children who are helping
 
02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
parents who need a um who have a
 
02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
prescription for hypodermic needles or
 
02:47:13.130 --> 02:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
pen needles those sort of things I'm a
 
02:47:15.889 --> 02:47:15.899 align:start position:0%
type 1 diabetic and have been since I
 
02:47:19.090 --> 02:47:19.100 align:start position:0%
was a child so I carry roughly
 
02:47:21.950 --> 02:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
six or seven hypodermic needles or
 
02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
products with me on a regular basis I
 
02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
have three children two of which are
 
02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
responsible enough to help deliver my
 
02:47:33.469 --> 02:47:33.479 align:start position:0%
medication to me if I need it or pick up
 
02:47:35.870 --> 02:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
after me or handle my purse or what have
 
02:47:39.050 --> 02:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
you and I'm trying to remove the
 
02:47:42.170 --> 02:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
criminality in that we're adding
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
language that would allow an authorized
 
02:47:46.849 --> 02:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
agent of somebody who has a prescription
 
02:47:49.010 --> 02:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
for these supplies
 
02:47:52.670 --> 02:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh who is a minor to be protected an
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
authorized agent I have the description
 
02:47:56.530 --> 02:47:56.540 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:47:59.330 --> 02:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
shall mean any person including but not
 
02:48:01.429 --> 02:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
limited to family member or caregiver
 
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
who has the intent to deliver the
 
02:48:05.330 --> 02:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
prescription drug to the person to whom
 
02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs are lawfully
 
02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:07.969 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs are lawfully
prescribed

02:48:07.969 --> 02:48:07.979 align:start position:0%
prescribed
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
another example would be a teenage
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
babysitter who had to administer an
 
02:48:16.550 --> 02:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
EpiPen or insulin to a child they were
 
02:48:18.469 --> 02:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
watching that would be breaking the law
 
02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:20.810 align:start position:0%
right now
um

02:48:20.810 --> 02:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:20.820 --> 02:48:22.130 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:48:22.130 --> 02:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:48:25.130 --> 02:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
another example I could think of was a
 
02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
parent going through IVF and needing to
 
02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
take a trigger shot in their gluteus
 
02:48:31.490 --> 02:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
they need help with that so sometimes
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
they'll ask a teenager to help them with
 
02:48:34.849 --> 02:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
that just by touching these supplies
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
they're breaking the law right now so I
 
02:48:38.750 --> 02:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
think that we need to recognize an
 
02:48:40.370 --> 02:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
authorized agent who might be a minor
 
02:48:41.809 --> 02:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
who's helping someone who's lawfully
 
02:48:45.230 --> 02:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
prescribed hypodermic products the
 
02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
second part of this legislation is to
 
02:48:49.370 --> 02:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
protect minors who might be
 
02:48:50.809 --> 02:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
participating in the needle exchange
 
02:48:53.450 --> 02:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
program right now that's an anonymous
 
02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
program so I'm not sure how many people
 
02:48:56.990 --> 02:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
that would even affect because we're not
 
02:48:59.210 --> 02:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
asking for ages or names as far as I
 
02:49:01.010 --> 02:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
understand so I don't want to
 
02:49:02.630 --> 02:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
criminalize people who are seeking
 
02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
assistance of these programs to get help
 
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
for their substance abuse I don't think
 
02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
we want to put more people through
 
02:49:11.450 --> 02:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
um legal problems when they're reaching
 
02:49:13.969 --> 02:49:13.979 align:start position:0%
out for substance abuse assistance
 
02:49:16.610 --> 02:49:16.620 align:start position:0%
and I think that I had one more one more
 
02:49:18.290 --> 02:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
reference point is um there's a product
 
02:49:20.150 --> 02:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
prescribed to all type 1 diabetics
 
02:49:23.570 --> 02:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
called a glucagon glucagon kit and if I
 
02:49:26.090 --> 02:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
were to go unconscious
 
02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
um in a situation I would need to be
 
02:49:31.190 --> 02:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
administered a glucagon shot in my thigh
 
02:49:33.050 --> 02:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
and I obviously can't administer myself
 
02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
so whoever's around which might be my
 
02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
minor children would need to draw up
 
02:49:40.070 --> 02:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
this medication into a hypodermic needle
 
02:49:42.170 --> 02:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
and inject it into my thigh to save my
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
life minutes matter so I obviously train
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
my kids on how to use this currently
 
02:49:48.770 --> 02:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
just by touching it and looking at it
 
02:49:51.170 --> 02:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
they're breaking the law so
 
02:49:53.150 --> 02:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
I'll yield any questions people might
 
02:49:55.849 --> 02:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
have I think it's pretty simple
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay questions for representative
 
02:49:57.600 --> 02:49:59.150 align:start position:0%
okay questions for representative
Phillips

02:49:59.150 --> 02:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
Phillips
 
02:50:02.270 --> 02:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative yes go ahead thank you so
 
02:50:04.910 --> 02:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
besides um children with allergies that
 
02:50:07.610 --> 02:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
might carry epipens
 
02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
um and type one or type 2 diabetics is
 
02:50:12.770 --> 02:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
there another condition you can think of
 
02:50:16.250 --> 02:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
offhand that someone under 18 might need
 
02:50:19.849 --> 02:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't know of any but um you know
 
02:50:25.030 --> 02:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
type 1 diabetics is a very common
 
02:50:27.469 --> 02:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
autoimmune condition in children right
 
02:50:28.969 --> 02:50:28.979 align:start position:0%
now so
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and epipens as I know there's a large
 
02:50:33.650 --> 02:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
allergy population as well and it's not
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
just for
 
02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:35.809 align:start position:0%
just for
um

02:50:35.809 --> 02:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:37.610 --> 02:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
no I I don't I don't know of any
 
02:50:40.370 --> 02:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
specific uh conditions I mean I I felt
 
02:50:41.630 --> 02:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
this in my heart that doesn't connected
 
02:50:42.889 --> 02:50:42.899 align:start position:0%
with this that my kids were breaking the
 
02:50:43.790 --> 02:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
loss I was like well we have to do
 
02:50:45.590 --> 02:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
something about this so absolutely yeah
 
02:50:46.849 --> 02:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
maybe you're familiar with other
 
02:50:49.250 --> 02:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
conditions no okay anyway thank you
 
02:50:50.990 --> 02:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:52.429 --> 02:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
 
02:50:52.439 --> 02:50:54.349 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
Phillips

02:50:54.349 --> 02:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
Phillips
 
02:50:59.090 --> 02:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:51:02.389 --> 02:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
02:51:02.399 --> 02:51:04.309 align:start position:0%
taking this question
um

02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:07.730 --> 02:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
seems to make common sense but I wonder
 
02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:08.510 align:start position:0%
seems to make common sense but I wonder
um

02:51:08.510 --> 02:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:11.210 --> 02:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
I wonder how someone gets designated as
 
02:51:13.969 --> 02:51:13.979 align:start position:0%
an authorized agent agent
 
02:51:16.490 --> 02:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem to be at least I
 
02:51:19.490 --> 02:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
didn't find text to explain that but
 
02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:21.230 align:start position:0%
didn't find text to explain that but
how

02:51:21.230 --> 02:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:51:24.110 --> 02:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
who would oversee that if anybody
 
02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
and what are the what's the criteria for
 
02:51:30.110 --> 02:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
being an authorized agent
 
02:51:32.030 --> 02:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
02:51:33.650 --> 02:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
say I would give permission as a
 
02:51:35.929 --> 02:51:35.939 align:start position:0%
prescribe as a person prescribed because
 
02:51:37.849 --> 02:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
the intent was to deliver the
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
prescription drug to the person whom the
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs are lawfully
 
02:51:42.830 --> 02:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
prescribed so this is all relative to
 
02:51:44.450 --> 02:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
minors so my children in that moment
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
would be an authorized agent authorized
 
02:51:48.349 --> 02:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
by me because I'm the one authorized to
 
02:51:54.670 --> 02:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:58.010 --> 02:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
I guess I I I'm not really sure but I
 
02:51:59.389 --> 02:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
wonder if we should look into that a
 
02:52:02.210 --> 02:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
little bit more to have a you know a
 
02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:03.290 align:start position:0%
little bit more to have a you know a
specific

02:52:03.290 --> 02:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
way of describing an authorized agent
 
02:52:09.950 --> 02:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
and um figuring out who that person is
 
02:52:11.570 --> 02:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
you know I wonder when you authorize
 
02:52:13.429 --> 02:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
someone to use your vehicle
 
02:52:14.929 --> 02:52:14.939 align:start position:0%
it's just a simple I gave them
 
02:52:14.939 --> 02:52:16.670 align:start position:0%
it's just a simple I gave them
permission

02:52:16.670 --> 02:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
permission
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:23.990 --> 02:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you for
 
02:52:25.070 --> 02:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
the question other questions for
 
02:52:27.050 --> 02:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips representative
 
02:52:27.060 --> 02:52:29.090 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips representative
Merchant

02:52:29.090 --> 02:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:52:32.450 --> 02:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm clear about this as I read it
 
02:52:36.650 --> 02:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
went back to look at the statute itself
 
02:52:39.170 --> 02:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
and the uh 318
 
02:52:40.429 --> 02:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
which is kind of weird
 
02:52:42.650 --> 02:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
I live most of my life
 
02:52:44.990 --> 02:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent a child from
 
02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
having that device as long as it has a
 
02:52:49.130 --> 02:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
prescription attached to it yeah this
 
02:52:50.690 --> 02:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do it with children who
 
02:52:52.370 --> 02:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
are prescribed it yes
 
02:52:52.380 --> 02:52:55.910 align:start position:0%
are prescribed it yes
so

02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:57.469 --> 02:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
how we understand if they're not
 
02:52:58.969 --> 02:52:58.979 align:start position:0%
prescribed it why would they have it
 
02:53:01.969 --> 02:53:01.979 align:start position:0%
what I mean is that the a child touch so
 
02:53:03.530 --> 02:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
if their family members say a sibling of
 
02:53:05.690 --> 02:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
theirs a younger sibling has a need for
 
02:53:07.849 --> 02:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
has a prescription and the older sibling
 
02:53:10.969 --> 02:53:10.979 align:start position:0%
is helping to administer the medication
 
02:53:14.450 --> 02:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
right now any child under 18 who does
 
02:53:16.010 --> 02:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
not have a prescription for cannot pick
 
02:53:19.910 --> 02:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:31.690 --> 02:53:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
what's authorization because I think at
 
02:53:35.330 --> 02:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
that point in time who's author writing
 
02:53:36.410 --> 02:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
is a whom
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be critical here
 
02:53:38.399 --> 02:53:39.530 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be critical here
um

02:53:39.530 --> 02:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:41.450 --> 02:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
I hear what you're saying as far as the
 
02:53:43.010 --> 02:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
other person in the family or somebody
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
else if you're gonna say it at a
 
02:53:46.730 --> 02:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
football game and you have somebody has
 
02:53:48.290 --> 02:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
a bee sting and you have an EpiPen and
 
02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
you want to have somebody else give it
 
02:53:50.929 --> 02:53:50.939 align:start position:0%
the person who's been strong may not be
 
02:53:52.190 --> 02:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
able to give the EpiPen but somebody
 
02:53:54.830 --> 02:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
near them was underage could so I
 
02:53:55.969 --> 02:53:55.979 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from I
 
02:53:57.349 --> 02:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
just don't know how this is to be
 
02:53:58.969 --> 02:53:58.979 align:start position:0%
written that's all thank you
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
02:54:03.110 --> 02:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I think this um the part about
 
02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
the designated agent that might be
 
02:54:05.870 --> 02:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
something to have our committee
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
researcher look into and provide
 
02:54:09.349 --> 02:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
information to the committee
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
but isn't it true that as a parent
 
02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:21.290 align:start position:0%
but isn't it true that as a parent
um

02:54:21.290 --> 02:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:25.370 --> 02:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
there are many things that you authorize
 
02:54:28.490 --> 02:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
your child to do that are not in writing
 
02:54:28.500 --> 02:54:30.550 align:start position:0%
your child to do that are not in writing
not

02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:54:33.230 --> 02:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
written down in a particular format or
 
02:54:35.809 --> 02:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
anything else but you as a parent can
 
02:54:39.290 --> 02:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
make it very clear to your child what
 
02:54:42.170 --> 02:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
they are authorized to do and what they
 
02:54:43.969 --> 02:54:43.979 align:start position:0%
are not authorized to do and what the
 
02:54:46.370 --> 02:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
consequences are if those trusts are
 
02:54:46.380 --> 02:54:47.990 align:start position:0%
consequences are if those trusts are
breached

02:54:47.990 --> 02:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
breached
 
02:54:51.769 --> 02:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:54.050 --> 02:54:54.060 align:start position:0%

I just wanted to uh kind of follow up
 
02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
and not repeat the the language
 
02:55:37.429 --> 02:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
because obviously I agree with
 
02:55:39.769 --> 02:55:39.779 align:start position:0%
everything representative Phillips said
 
02:55:43.730 --> 02:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to clarify that uh under our
 
02:55:45.530 --> 02:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
current law
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh authorized agents are allowed for a
 
02:55:52.809 --> 02:55:52.819 align:start position:0%
wide range of things as far as
 
02:55:56.030 --> 02:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs if
 
02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:56.990 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs if
um

02:55:56.990 --> 02:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:00.050 --> 02:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
um if an adult
 
02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
has a prescription and asks another
 
02:56:07.610 --> 02:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
adult to help administer that
 
02:56:09.410 --> 02:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
prescription they are an authorized
 
02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
agent currently under the law and so I
 
02:56:15.170 --> 02:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
would just direct like the um
 
02:56:20.929 --> 02:56:20.939 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 31842 is dealing with per
 
02:56:22.969 --> 02:56:22.979 align:start position:0%
possession of prescription drugs and
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's where it defines
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
um what authorized agent is and so you
 
02:56:31.450 --> 02:56:31.460 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to possess position
 
02:56:33.410 --> 02:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs that you're not
 
02:56:35.330 --> 02:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
prescribed unless you're an authorized
 
02:56:38.030 --> 02:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
agent which is currently in statute and
 
02:56:40.670 --> 02:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
currently allowed and so all that we're
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
proposing in this bill is to essentially
 
02:56:46.969 --> 02:56:46.979 align:start position:0%
use that same logic for these these uh
 
02:56:49.670 --> 02:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
hypodermic needles that someone else has
 
02:56:52.190 --> 02:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
a legitimate use for using them and
 
02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
you're just facilitating that and you
 
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to be I I'm not sure
 
02:57:00.110 --> 02:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
that we need to you know redefine the
 
02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
entire authorized agent
 
02:57:04.730 --> 02:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
um thing because it has been working
 
02:57:07.070 --> 02:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
this whole time like no one has has
 
02:57:09.110 --> 02:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
brought that up as an issue this bill is
 
02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
only with the issue of over regulating
 
02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
these children and people that provided
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
the um the needles to the children and
 
02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:18.230 align:start position:0%
the um the needles to the children and
saying

02:57:18.230 --> 02:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
um that there are certain circumstances
 
02:57:23.030 --> 02:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
that it's appropriate and shouldn't be
 
02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:24.170 align:start position:0%
that it's appropriate and shouldn't be
unlawful

02:57:24.170 --> 02:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
unlawful
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's all we're trying to
 
02:57:27.769 --> 02:57:27.779 align:start position:0%
clarify in the law so thank you
 
02:57:29.269 --> 02:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative questions for
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative representative Shapiro
 
02:57:34.370 --> 02:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:57:36.410 --> 02:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
clarifying that um that's very helpful
 
02:57:38.809 --> 02:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
could you just repeat the statute that
 
02:57:41.389 --> 02:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
where authorized agent is defined yes
 
02:57:47.809 --> 02:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
it's RSA 318 42 and it's Roman 1.
 
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:54.110 --> 02:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:57:55.790 --> 02:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
speaking today
 
02:57:57.359 --> 02:57:58.490 align:start position:0%
speaking today
um

02:57:58.490 --> 02:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:00.830 --> 02:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
under current law if
 
02:58:03.230 --> 02:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
If the parents are gone for example and
 
02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
they have needles at the house and the
 
02:58:07.610 --> 02:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
children are at home alone is that
 
02:58:10.130 --> 02:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
considered possession or if a child
 
02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
borrows the mother's car for example and
 
02:58:15.050 --> 02:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
she always keeps needles in her car are
 
02:58:17.630 --> 02:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
they considered to be in possession are
 
02:58:20.210 --> 02:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
they are they can can they be held
 
02:58:22.429 --> 02:58:22.439 align:start position:0%
criminally liable for borrowing mom's
 
02:58:22.439 --> 02:58:24.590 align:start position:0%
criminally liable for borrowing mom's
car

02:58:24.590 --> 02:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
car
 
02:58:26.570 --> 02:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I definitely
 
02:58:30.429 --> 02:58:30.439 align:start position:0%
so I proposed a version of this bill uh
 
02:58:34.130 --> 02:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
brought this issue back in a prior
 
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
session and I had a number of of
 
02:58:39.469 --> 02:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
situations that I thought that this
 
02:58:42.530 --> 02:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
could be potentially an issue as far as
 
02:58:45.830 --> 02:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
what is possession of of the needle like
 
02:58:47.990 --> 02:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you grab your mom's purse
 
02:58:49.849 --> 02:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
if she didn't give you permission to
 
02:58:52.250 --> 02:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
grab the purse does that is that allowed
 
02:58:55.309 --> 02:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
because the needle is in the purse
 
02:58:55.319 --> 02:58:56.650 align:start position:0%
because the needle is in the purse
um

02:58:56.650 --> 02:58:56.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:59.269 --> 02:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
it I think that
 
02:59:01.610 --> 02:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
um at that point you're you know maybe
 
02:59:04.370 --> 02:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
if you had the car if the parent left
 
02:59:06.530 --> 02:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
the left the needles in the car and the
 
02:59:08.870 --> 02:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
parent left gave you permission to use
 
02:59:11.210 --> 02:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
the car then maybe you could make an
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
argument but you're probably if you're
 
02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:13.790 align:start position:0%
argument but you're probably if you're
getting

02:59:13.790 --> 02:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
getting
 
02:59:15.410 --> 02:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
you know you get pulled over and the
 
02:59:17.809 --> 02:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
cops do a search and they say Hey you
 
02:59:20.090 --> 02:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
have this needle and and did you get
 
02:59:20.100 --> 02:59:21.590 align:start position:0%
have this needle and and did you get
permission

02:59:21.590 --> 02:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
permission
 
02:59:23.750 --> 02:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
you probably would have to go to court
 
02:59:26.809 --> 02:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
to say like hey this is I actually did
 
02:59:28.670 --> 02:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
get permission to use the car but not
 
02:59:31.309 --> 02:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
specifically the needle or you know uh
 
02:59:31.319 --> 02:59:32.690 align:start position:0%
specifically the needle or you know uh
that's

02:59:32.690 --> 02:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's probably going to come down to
 
02:59:37.910 --> 02:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
a legal thing if they if the if the
 
02:59:39.769 --> 02:59:39.779 align:start position:0%
courts wanted to
 
02:59:39.779 --> 02:59:40.610 align:start position:0%
courts wanted to
um

02:59:40.610 --> 02:59:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:45.290 --> 02:59:45.300 align:start position:0%
to uh prosecute you in that case and you
 
02:59:47.210 --> 02:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
would have to try and get the person
 
02:59:50.210 --> 02:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
that was authorized to kind of speak in
 
02:59:53.090 --> 02:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
your on your behalf I think
 
02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:53.929 align:start position:0%
your on your behalf I think
okay

02:59:53.929 --> 02:59:53.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:00:00.889 --> 03:00:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:03.170 --> 03:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
I think the intent of the law when it
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
was written was to
 
03:00:09.889 --> 03:00:09.899 align:start position:0%
limit the access of miners to these
 
03:00:09.899 --> 03:00:10.969 align:start position:0%
limit the access of miners to these
devices

03:00:10.969 --> 03:00:10.979 align:start position:0%
devices
 
03:00:12.889 --> 03:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
for a lot of different reasons
 
03:00:14.510 --> 03:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
I commend you what you're saying is
 
03:00:16.670 --> 03:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
trying to open this up but are we
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
opening up a can of worms where all of a
 
03:00:20.690 --> 03:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
sudden we're giving miners permission to
 
03:00:23.570 --> 03:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
have hypogenic needles and other things
 
03:00:25.370 --> 03:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
in their possession which is not the
 
03:00:26.630 --> 03:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
intent of what you're trying to get to
 
03:00:28.790 --> 03:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
but it does open up that window does it
 
03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:31.429 align:start position:0%
but it does open up that window does it
not

03:00:31.429 --> 03:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:33.769 --> 03:00:33.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question if they're
 
03:00:35.809 --> 03:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
possessing it for a legitimate use then
 
03:00:37.849 --> 03:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
I don't think that there there should be
 
03:00:42.849 --> 03:00:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:45.769 --> 03:00:45.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
03:00:51.050 --> 03:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think that
 
03:00:54.590 --> 03:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
an authorized agent is pretty clear
 
03:00:57.290 --> 03:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
about whether or not you're
 
03:01:00.110 --> 03:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
um you're authorized or not that would
 
03:01:05.330 --> 03:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:07.969 --> 03:01:07.979 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative Nagel
 
03:01:10.730 --> 03:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you this is
 
03:01:12.710 --> 03:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
an issue I've dealt with since I was 11
 
03:01:14.510 --> 03:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
years old my brother was a juvenile
 
03:01:17.210 --> 03:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
diabetic but the way we dealt with it is
 
03:01:20.809 --> 03:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
he had the glucagon on him if he needed
 
03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
it we took it off of him and
 
03:01:23.870 --> 03:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
administered it to him we weren't
 
03:01:26.090 --> 03:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
carrying it around ourselves
 
03:01:28.309 --> 03:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
and same thing with epipens the person
 
03:01:30.110 --> 03:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
who is affected by the illness has the
 
03:01:32.510 --> 03:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
EpiPen not the person you know who might
 
03:01:34.969 --> 03:01:34.979 align:start position:0%
administer it
 
03:01:38.150 --> 03:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
um so I think my question is that that's
 
03:01:40.370 --> 03:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
how I would deal with this am I wrong
 
03:01:43.250 --> 03:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
about that thank you for the question
 
03:01:47.330 --> 03:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
um under current law if you gave it to
 
03:01:50.050 --> 03:01:50.060 align:start position:0%
your sibling for them to administer it
 
03:01:53.450 --> 03:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
you and your sibling would all both be
 
03:01:56.450 --> 03:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
committing a crime under current law and
 
03:01:58.370 --> 03:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter that you're normally
 
03:02:01.190 --> 03:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
carrying it as soon as you allow another
 
03:02:02.630 --> 03:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
person that it doesn't have a
 
03:02:06.050 --> 03:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
prescription to possess it you and your
 
03:02:08.330 --> 03:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
the person possessing it both committed
 
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
a crime
 
03:02:11.929 --> 03:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're trying to address I
 
03:02:13.730 --> 03:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
don't think that you would normally
 
03:02:16.849 --> 03:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
maybe in the example of um you know a
 
03:02:19.330 --> 03:02:19.340 align:start position:0%
parent giving the EpiPen to a babysitter
 
03:02:22.849 --> 03:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
for the entire duration of the time that
 
03:02:24.650 --> 03:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
they're watching their kid might be a
 
03:02:26.530 --> 03:02:26.540 align:start position:0%
situation where the person is actually
 
03:02:29.570 --> 03:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
holding the EpiPen for the you know
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
two-year-old or whatever like you're not
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
giving it to the two-year-old and having
 
03:02:35.750 --> 03:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
them give it back to the to the
 
03:02:39.050 --> 03:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
babysitter later right so
 
03:02:40.730 --> 03:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question other
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative Merchant and
 
03:02:45.889 --> 03:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
looking at a couple attorneys on our
 
03:02:47.929 --> 03:02:47.939 align:start position:0%
committee would that be would that not
 
03:02:52.250 --> 03:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:56.570 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

03:02:56.570 --> 03:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:56.580 --> 03:02:58.370 align:start position:0%
um
if

03:02:58.370 --> 03:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:03:01.849 --> 03:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
it was an emergency and and
 
03:03:04.730 --> 03:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
um you didn't have permission so if the
 
03:03:06.590 --> 03:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
kid was like the two-year-old the
 
03:03:08.750 --> 03:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
babysitter was watching them
 
03:03:11.210 --> 03:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
um the the two-year-old had an emergency
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
they didn't get permission they went
 
03:03:14.990 --> 03:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
into the drawer and found the EpiPen and
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
and administered it that would be
 
03:03:19.370 --> 03:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
covered under the
 
03:03:22.190 --> 03:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
um the Good Samaritan law however the
 
03:03:23.809 --> 03:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
parents just giving it to them without
 
03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
an emergency ever happening like Prima
 
03:03:29.389 --> 03:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
before an emergency happening that is
 
03:03:31.070 --> 03:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
not an emergent situation and so
 
03:03:32.929 --> 03:03:32.939 align:start position:0%
therefore I don't believe that in that
 
03:03:34.610 --> 03:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
case that would be covered under the
 
03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
emergency emergent law any other
 
03:03:37.560 --> 03:03:40.730 align:start position:0%
emergency emergent law any other
questions

03:03:40.730 --> 03:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:42.530 --> 03:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you representative
 
03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:06.170 --> 03:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:08.450 --> 03:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman McDonald and
 
03:04:10.010 --> 03:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Abby
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
Rogers I'm the legislative liaison for
 
03:04:13.070 --> 03:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
03:04:15.110 --> 03:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'm in and I'm here today with Rachel
 
03:04:18.950 --> 03:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
Kush we came today to learn more about
 
03:04:21.530 --> 03:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
the intent of the sponsors Bill we had a
 
03:04:22.849 --> 03:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
conversation in the hall and realized
 
03:04:24.170 --> 03:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
that the intend the bill really is in
 
03:04:27.469 --> 03:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
section one related to The Possession or
 
03:04:29.870 --> 03:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
the assistance with a family member that
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
has a medical condition which would
 
03:04:33.950 --> 03:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
require a child a reminder to maybe
 
03:04:36.490 --> 03:04:36.500 align:start position:0%
assist the parent or caregiver with
 
03:04:40.610 --> 03:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
using that device so we were prepared to
 
03:04:42.650 --> 03:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the work that we
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
do with prevention with syringe service
 
03:04:47.990 --> 03:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
programs and I have Rachel here that
 
03:04:49.250 --> 03:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
could provide information to the
 
03:04:50.450 --> 03:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
committee on the second part of the bill
 
03:04:51.769 --> 03:04:51.779 align:start position:0%
if you're interested in hearing about
 
03:04:53.690 --> 03:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
that today or if you're more focused on
 
03:04:55.309 --> 03:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
the first part of the bill we can skip
 
03:04:56.750 --> 03:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
that we are trying to limit testimony
 
03:04:59.210 --> 03:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
the same minutes per per individuals so
 
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
great okay if you can cover it sure sure
 
03:05:06.230 --> 03:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Ray real Kush k-u-s-c-h and I
 
03:05:12.769 --> 03:05:12.779 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give a little background
 
03:05:14.269 --> 03:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
information about
 
03:05:16.990 --> 03:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
the second part of the Bell
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
which allows
 
03:05:19.920 --> 03:05:20.690 align:start position:0%
which allows
um

03:05:20.690 --> 03:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
allows the possession of syringes if
 
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
they have been obtained legitimately
 
03:05:28.849 --> 03:05:28.859 align:start position:0%
through a syringe service program so
 
03:05:31.070 --> 03:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
syringe service programs in New
 
03:05:31.080 --> 03:05:32.110 align:start position:0%
syringe service programs in New
Hampshire

03:05:32.110 --> 03:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:05:35.210 --> 03:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
are programs that
 
03:05:38.210 --> 03:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
um are kind of Statewide and they allow
 
03:05:41.690 --> 03:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
people the ability to get sterile
 
03:05:44.510 --> 03:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
syringes to inject drugs if they are
 
03:05:46.309 --> 03:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
actively injecting drug injection drug
 
03:05:46.319 --> 03:05:47.389 align:start position:0%
actively injecting drug injection drug
users

03:05:47.389 --> 03:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
users
 
03:05:51.410 --> 03:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
and they help people get linked to
 
03:05:54.410 --> 03:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment disorder they
 
03:05:57.050 --> 03:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
help people learn more about overdose
 
03:05:57.060 --> 03:05:58.090 align:start position:0%
help people learn more about overdose
prevention

03:05:58.090 --> 03:05:58.100 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
and get linked into care for
 
03:06:04.429 --> 03:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
testing for different infectious
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
diseases so
 
03:06:08.510 --> 03:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
um so are there any questions
 
03:06:11.330 --> 03:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
specifically about this bill related to
 
03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:18.830 --> 03:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
I had a couple of questions so my first
 
03:06:20.809 --> 03:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
um does the department have an uh an
 
03:06:25.490 --> 03:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
actual opinion on this bill are you just
 
03:06:28.610 --> 03:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
here to answer questions we we are not
 
03:06:30.050 --> 03:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
taking a position on the go where here's
 
03:06:33.230 --> 03:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
a resource today thank you may I have
 
03:06:35.330 --> 03:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
one other question with the specific
 
03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh with respect specifically to the
 
03:06:40.849 --> 03:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
needle exchange portion but possibly
 
03:06:46.450 --> 03:06:46.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:50.570 --> 03:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
do you know of situations where the
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill
 
03:06:57.469 --> 03:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
might be used in a way that I would deem
 
03:07:00.950 --> 03:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriate where you have per EX for
 
03:07:00.960 --> 03:07:02.090 align:start position:0%
inappropriate where you have per EX for
example

03:07:02.090 --> 03:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:07:06.070 --> 03:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
a family where the misuse of needles is
 
03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
fairly prevalent
 
03:07:12.769 --> 03:07:12.779 align:start position:0%
and somebody says oh are you
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
are you parent allowing your child to
 
03:07:17.630 --> 03:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
use this
 
03:07:20.450 --> 03:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
instrument and the parent just says yeah
 
03:07:20.460 --> 03:07:21.730 align:start position:0%
instrument and the parent just says yeah
whatever

03:07:21.730 --> 03:07:21.740 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:07:27.349 --> 03:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
is it possible that by enacting this we
 
03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
may be
 
03:07:28.680 --> 03:07:31.630 align:start position:0%
may be
enabling

03:07:31.630 --> 03:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
03:07:34.610 --> 03:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
misuse in a situation where we would
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
prefer not to have misuse in addition to
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
the uses that people have testified that
 
03:07:46.309 --> 03:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:48.830 --> 03:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
03:07:53.450 --> 03:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what uh what you mean by
 
03:07:56.210 --> 03:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
misuse related to how it says authorized
 
03:07:58.670 --> 03:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
agent in the bill so
 
03:07:58.680 --> 03:07:59.570 align:start position:0%
agent in the bill so
um

03:07:59.570 --> 03:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:02.269 --> 03:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
so I think the bill is written such that
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
it would it would make it so that uh
 
03:08:09.889 --> 03:08:09.899 align:start position:0%
any any syringes that were supplied
 
03:08:11.090 --> 03:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
through a syringe service program
 
03:08:11.100 --> 03:08:12.889 align:start position:0%
through a syringe service program
legitimately

03:08:12.889 --> 03:08:12.899 align:start position:0%
legitimately
 
03:08:17.330 --> 03:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:19.550 --> 03:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
03:08:19.560 --> 03:08:20.769 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
Merchant

03:08:20.769 --> 03:08:20.779 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
03:08:23.090 --> 03:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
first of all a statement and a question
 
03:08:26.450 --> 03:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
but as a
 
03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the second part of this
 
03:08:35.090 --> 03:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
from line 11 down
 
03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
it sort of conflicts with lines above it
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to understand
 
03:08:42.650 --> 03:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
if the first part of it is you have to
 
03:08:45.590 --> 03:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
have a prescription to begin with
 
03:08:48.650 --> 03:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
in order to obtain it you have therefore
 
03:08:50.690 --> 03:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
need a prescription
 
03:08:53.330 --> 03:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the second section it
 
03:08:54.769 --> 03:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
says that you don't have to have a
 
03:08:54.779 --> 03:08:55.790 align:start position:0%
says that you don't have to have a
prescription

03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
03:08:58.670 --> 03:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
but the first one says you do
 
03:09:01.130 --> 03:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the language and
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
saying it really is not in
 
03:09:05.330 --> 03:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
sync with each other because in order
 
03:09:07.730 --> 03:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
for somebody to have it you have to have
 
03:09:08.710 --> 03:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
a prescription
 
03:09:10.969 --> 03:09:10.979 align:start position:0%
basically yes
 
03:09:14.450 --> 03:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know I can speak to that
 
03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:20.450 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know I can speak to that
one

03:09:20.450 --> 03:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
didn't you I think so I could speak that
 
03:09:24.230 --> 03:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
I would I thank you for the question
 
03:09:25.790 --> 03:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative merchandise as you know
 
03:09:28.370 --> 03:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
the intent of the the sponsor spoke of
 
03:09:29.870 --> 03:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
the intent of to bring the bill forward
 
03:09:32.090 --> 03:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
to to assist with heart with parents
 
03:09:34.010 --> 03:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
caregivers medical needs I can see how
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
you could say that there would be some
 
03:09:37.490 --> 03:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
concerns about the second part
 
03:09:38.690 --> 03:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
um you know we're here today to really
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
talk about the fact that
 
03:09:43.070 --> 03:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
um as a department when we look at uh
 
03:09:45.650 --> 03:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
into the subject of subject substance
 
03:09:49.070 --> 03:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
misuse we use the youth risk behavior
 
03:09:51.050 --> 03:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
survey and have found that substance use
 
03:09:53.269 --> 03:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
identified by data we collect from that
 
03:09:57.050 --> 03:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
survey starts as young as 12. and we
 
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
support the concept of minors can get
 
03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment at the age of
 
03:10:04.370 --> 03:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
12. we don't have a position in this
 
03:10:06.349 --> 03:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
bill but would like to you know just to
 
03:10:08.510 --> 03:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
talk about the fact that you know there
 
03:10:11.349 --> 03:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
should be resources available for for
 
03:10:13.630 --> 03:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
minors in that situation so any
 
03:10:15.469 --> 03:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
technicalities on the bill perhaps
 
03:10:16.610 --> 03:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
should be better addressed with the
 
03:10:18.530 --> 03:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
sponsor and maybe on a subcommittee
 
03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:19.370 align:start position:0%
sponsor and maybe on a subcommittee
level

03:10:19.370 --> 03:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:10:21.290 --> 03:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
and perhaps an amendment needs to be
 
03:10:22.670 --> 03:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
offered or something
 
03:10:26.450 --> 03:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative the Weber
 
03:10:29.630 --> 03:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you just as you read the bill
 
03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
isn't the purpose for two different
 
03:10:34.130 --> 03:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
sections that have two different kinds
 
03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
of Provisions because they're addressing
 
03:10:39.250 --> 03:10:39.260 align:start position:0%
two different parts of the existing Bill
 
03:10:41.690 --> 03:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
one being
 
03:10:44.349 --> 03:10:44.359 align:start position:0%
syringes that are part of a prescription
 
03:10:47.710 --> 03:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
and therefore there is a prescription
 
03:10:50.389 --> 03:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
and the second part being part of the
 
03:10:53.030 --> 03:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
existing bill that deals with syringes
 
03:10:55.730 --> 03:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
that were never a part of a prescription
 
03:10:58.190 --> 03:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
but part of a needle exchange and that's
 
03:11:00.170 --> 03:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
why you knew the two different sections
 
03:11:02.090 --> 03:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
and one has a prescription and one
 
03:11:06.530 --> 03:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:10.849 --> 03:11:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:12.830 --> 03:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much thank you
 
03:11:13.849 --> 03:11:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:11:13.859 --> 03:11:16.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
thank you both

03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you both
 
03:11:17.990 --> 03:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the final pink card I have this
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
morning uh is from
 
03:11:22.790 --> 03:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
Lauren McGinley
 
03:11:35.870 --> 03:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
is Miss McGinley here
 
03:11:41.090 --> 03:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone else wish to testify on
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:11:45.230 --> 03:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay saying no one I'm going to close
 
03:11:48.530 --> 03:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 397.
 
03:11:50.510 --> 03:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
03:11:50.520 --> 03:12:09.170 align:start position:0%
at this point
um

03:12:09.170 --> 03:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:12.290 --> 03:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:13.370 --> 03:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
hers doesn't do we want to continue with
 
03:12:13.380 --> 03:12:19.610 align:start position:0%
hers doesn't do we want to continue with
this

03:12:19.610 --> 03:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
um it's uh it's 12 10 by my watch do we
 
03:12:24.590 --> 03:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
want to continue I'll ask the
 
03:12:27.710 --> 03:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
committee's Indulgence or failing you
 
03:12:29.210 --> 03:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
want to continue or do you want to um
 
03:12:33.650 --> 03:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:36.309 --> 03:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
we have six
 
03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like a break that no two before
 
03:12:42.650 --> 03:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
lunch one of which should be incredibly
 
03:12:42.660 --> 03:12:46.730 align:start position:0%
lunch one of which should be incredibly
short

03:12:46.730 --> 03:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:49.370 --> 03:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
any preferences in light of the weather
 
03:12:51.650 --> 03:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
I would certainly appreciate continuing
 
03:12:54.230 --> 03:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
on and if somebody needs to step out and
 
03:12:56.150 --> 03:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
get nourishment these are hearings we
 
03:12:58.309 --> 03:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
don't need a quorum for a hearing
 
03:13:02.210 --> 03:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
okay so anybody who is suffering can can
 
03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
Rush away and get notes from somebody
 
03:13:06.469 --> 03:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
else when they come back any objection
 
03:13:08.990 --> 03:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
to continuing then
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none all right let's proceed to
 
03:13:13.550 --> 03:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh let me I will then proceed to open
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 338.
 
03:13:19.370 --> 03:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
and accordingly I will recognize
 
03:13:22.370 --> 03:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative adjutant to uh
 
03:13:24.230 --> 03:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
to uh introduce the bill was the Prime
 
03:13:32.590 --> 03:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.910 --> 03:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
03:13:36.530 --> 03:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh my name is
 
03:13:38.269 --> 03:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
representative Josh Adrian from the town
 
03:13:40.790 --> 03:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
of Enfield and I bring to you today HB
 
03:13:43.849 --> 03:13:43.859 align:start position:0%
338 a bill that would do several things
 
03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
before I forget to before I get to those
 
03:13:47.330 --> 03:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
I figured I would talk about where the
 
03:13:50.269 --> 03:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
bill came from in 2020 the state of New
 
03:13:52.010 --> 03:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adopted a co-pay cap for
 
03:13:54.170 --> 03:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
insulin and while I was happy to support
 
03:13:56.030 --> 03:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
that at the time I had a lingering
 
03:13:58.550 --> 03:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
concern in the back of my mind a co-pay
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
necessitates commercial insurance or
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
government-backed Insurance like
 
03:14:03.410 --> 03:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicare
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
at the time I voted for that bill I was
 
03:14:07.010 --> 03:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
an uninsured American and I knew there
 
03:14:08.990 --> 03:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
were many more like me people who made
 
03:14:10.849 --> 03:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
too much for Medicaid but not nearly
 
03:14:13.250 --> 03:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
enough to afford Commercial Insurance
 
03:14:16.370 --> 03:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
in 2021 in 2022 Congress took action
 
03:14:19.250 --> 03:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
again within the same co-pay parameters
 
03:14:22.190 --> 03:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
I still held those concerns
 
03:14:24.410 --> 03:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
so in September I submitted an LSR that
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
would expand to Medicaid to further
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
cover those individuals and qualify for
 
03:14:28.730 --> 03:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
the cap
 
03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
OLS and I ran into an issue with the
 
03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rules and so through a work
 
03:14:36.190 --> 03:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
around the language was placed in nhrsa
 
03:14:38.929 --> 03:14:38.939 align:start position:0%
161-l Colon 2 the New Hampshire
 
03:14:41.510 --> 03:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
prescription drug Advantage program a
 
03:14:43.070 --> 03:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
program that I did not know existed in
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
the rsas prior to November I read it
 
03:14:46.610 --> 03:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
over and I thought well isn't this
 
03:14:48.830 --> 03:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
fantastic we have a mechanism to reduce
 
03:14:50.510 --> 03:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of prescriptions and deal with
 
03:14:52.610 --> 03:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
big Pharma right in our statute
 
03:14:54.950 --> 03:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
why have I not heard of this before I
 
03:14:56.389 --> 03:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
began calling around and sure enough
 
03:14:59.030 --> 03:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
nobody else had either it turns out this
 
03:15:00.830 --> 03:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
was a program that got hit with the one
 
03:15:03.230 --> 03:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
dollar budget fix shortly after passing
 
03:15:06.290 --> 03:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
in 2008 and has not been active since
 
03:15:08.389 --> 03:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
so now that we've arrived to today the
 
03:15:10.849 --> 03:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
bill does one smaller thing and its
 
03:15:12.170 --> 03:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
other committee referral would do a
 
03:15:13.130 --> 03:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
bigger thing
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
the small thing it would do would be to
 
03:15:16.610 --> 03:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
add language to the RSA that
 
03:15:18.650 --> 03:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
specifically caps the cost of insulin
 
03:15:20.510 --> 03:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
copay for the four percent of New
 
03:15:22.790 --> 03:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents that are reported to
 
03:15:24.769 --> 03:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
not have insurance per the insurance
 
03:15:26.570 --> 03:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
department and there are two things
 
03:15:29.630 --> 03:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
about that figure that I think may make
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
that four percent figure a little low
 
03:15:33.830 --> 03:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
the reporting mechanism on that I'm
 
03:15:35.330 --> 03:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
really hard-pressed to believe that only
 
03:15:37.370 --> 03:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
four percent of the state particularly
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
low-wage workers fall into the
 
03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
parameters of not having employer
 
03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
Insurance on making too much to qualify
 
03:15:46.490 --> 03:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
for State assistance
 
03:15:48.530 --> 03:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
um and making too little to qualify
 
03:15:50.570 --> 03:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance but also the
 
03:15:52.450 --> 03:15:52.460 align:start position:0%
existence of the public health emergency
 
03:15:58.090 --> 03:15:58.100 align:start position:0%
and how once that's over uh or once we
 
03:16:00.530 --> 03:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
move on from that as far as Medicaid is
 
03:16:01.690 --> 03:16:01.700 align:start position:0%
concerned there'll be a lot more
 
03:16:03.469 --> 03:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire who are
 
03:16:03.479 --> 03:16:05.510 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire who are
uninsured

03:16:05.510 --> 03:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
uninsured
 
03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
um but that language doesn't do a whole
 
03:16:08.990 --> 03:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
lot unless the bigger thing this build
 
03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
does goes into effect the bigger issue
 
03:16:13.790 --> 03:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
here would be to re-establish and refund
 
03:16:15.230 --> 03:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
the program and we can do that by
 
03:16:17.330 --> 03:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
agreeing that the program has Merit that
 
03:16:18.710 --> 03:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
prescriptions of all kinds in the United
 
03:16:21.170 --> 03:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
States are far too expensive these days
 
03:16:22.910 --> 03:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
and that grandstaters especially the
 
03:16:25.190 --> 03:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
elderly and those unfixed incomes need
 
03:16:27.290 --> 03:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
price relief and we can deliver that in
 
03:16:28.490 --> 03:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
the form of Cheaper prescriptions
 
03:16:30.170 --> 03:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
through the refunding of the New
 
03:16:31.969 --> 03:16:31.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RX Advantage Program
 
03:16:33.530 --> 03:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'm hard-pressed to think you'd find
 
03:16:35.330 --> 03:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
anybody who relies on prescription
 
03:16:37.010 --> 03:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
medication who holds the opinion that
 
03:16:39.290 --> 03:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
the cost of these Goods is reasonable in
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
fact many Americans either do not fill
 
03:16:42.650 --> 03:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
prescriptions because they can't afford
 
03:16:44.450 --> 03:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
them or they cut medication in half
 
03:16:45.650 --> 03:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford to take what
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
their doctor tells them and they need to
 
03:16:49.670 --> 03:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
take every day to get better and live
 
03:16:51.769 --> 03:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
happy healthy lives with that I would
 
03:16:52.910 --> 03:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to consider two
 
03:16:55.190 --> 03:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
pictures here a smaller picture and a
 
03:16:56.269 --> 03:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
bigger picture
 
03:16:58.730 --> 03:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
small pictures that we have to a way to
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
universally lock in the price of a
 
03:17:02.450 --> 03:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
life-saving drug like insulin for
 
03:17:04.309 --> 03:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
uninsured Granite sitters the bigger
 
03:17:06.170 --> 03:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
pictures that we already on the books
 
03:17:08.030 --> 03:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
have the means to reduce prescription
 
03:17:10.010 --> 03:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
costs for constituents all the guesswork
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
has been taken out of that and it can be
 
03:17:13.790 --> 03:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
sent somewhere else where hopefully they
 
03:17:14.990 --> 03:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
can find the means to pay for this
 
03:17:17.150 --> 03:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
important program and I would like to
 
03:17:20.510 --> 03:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
raise one point with the committee as
 
03:17:23.090 --> 03:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
far as the methodology of the bill
 
03:17:24.830 --> 03:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at that under the fiscal
 
03:17:24.840 --> 03:17:25.929 align:start position:0%
if you look at that under the fiscal
note

03:17:25.929 --> 03:17:25.939 align:start position:0%
note
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
presumably individuals who receive
 
03:17:29.389 --> 03:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
coverage through Medicaid will not
 
03:17:31.190 --> 03:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
utilize this benefit given that Medicaid
 
03:17:33.230 --> 03:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
insulin coverage is a one dollar copay
 
03:17:35.570 --> 03:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
for up to a 90-day Supply I think that's
 
03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
an important thing to note because as I
 
03:17:41.530 --> 03:17:41.540 align:start position:0%
was just speaking to Mr very from HHS
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid threshold as far as income
 
03:17:46.490 --> 03:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
is concerned cuts off at around sixteen
 
03:17:48.130 --> 03:17:48.140 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for an individual
 
03:17:52.370 --> 03:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
whereas this bill uses the figure of the
 
03:17:54.290 --> 03:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
300 percent
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
um or within 300 of the poverty uh
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines parameter so that gets that
 
03:18:01.130 --> 03:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
closer to forty one thousand and there
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
is a considerable income difference
 
03:18:06.290 --> 03:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
between somebody making 16 000 a year uh
 
03:18:07.550 --> 03:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
and forty two thousand a year it
 
03:18:09.050 --> 03:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
captures a lot more people
 
03:18:10.610 --> 03:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
um using the 300 of the property
 
03:18:12.349 --> 03:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines so
 
03:18:14.349 --> 03:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to just clarify that before
 
03:18:16.670 --> 03:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
somebody said well you already have a
 
03:18:17.690 --> 03:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
lot of people on Medicaid they're
 
03:18:18.889 --> 03:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
already paying the dollar I understand
 
03:18:23.630 --> 03:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
that my goal here really is to close the
 
03:18:25.730 --> 03:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
gap like I said several times in the
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
testimony between people who do not
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
qualify qualify for Medicaid because
 
03:18:32.090 --> 03:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
they make just barely too much uh and
 
03:18:34.010 --> 03:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
those who do not have insurance through
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
their work or affording it commercially
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
so I understand we're behind I'll wrap
 
03:18:39.769 --> 03:18:39.779 align:start position:0%
up with that and I can take any
 
03:18:39.779 --> 03:18:40.910 align:start position:0%
up with that and I can take any
questions

03:18:40.910 --> 03:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:18:43.670 --> 03:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative way on um thank
 
03:18:44.750 --> 03:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:18:46.490 --> 03:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
representatives for sticking with us and
 
03:18:49.010 --> 03:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
being here to testify my question is
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
regarding which types of insulin you
 
03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
intend to cover with this
 
03:18:54.530 --> 03:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
um and and what limits you would have on
 
03:18:54.540 --> 03:18:57.050 align:start position:0%
um and and what limits you would have on
this

03:18:57.050 --> 03:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:59.090 --> 03:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
types of insulin we would cover
 
03:19:01.490 --> 03:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll ask my question better
 
03:19:03.230 --> 03:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
um so there's not really generic insulin
 
03:19:04.550 --> 03:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
on the market because that's been
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
replaced by new novel ones they do sell
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
some as sort of branded generics
 
03:19:11.809 --> 03:19:11.819 align:start position:0%
um the way it's written is insulin I
 
03:19:13.010 --> 03:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're intending to
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
include insulin pumps or other very
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
costly Innovative medical devices which
 
03:19:20.510 --> 03:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
while they improve people's lives are
 
03:19:22.429 --> 03:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
very very expensive I was wondering what
 
03:19:23.809 --> 03:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
what limits you were planning to put on
 
03:19:26.030 --> 03:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
this sure I will happily cop to the fact
 
03:19:29.450 --> 03:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
that I'm very grateful to not have to
 
03:19:30.950 --> 03:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
have used that medication before so I
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
was not aware that there were broader
 
03:19:34.130 --> 03:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
parameters on that
 
03:19:34.140 --> 03:19:35.450 align:start position:0%
parameters on that
um so

03:19:35.450 --> 03:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:19:38.030 --> 03:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I would like to on that issue defer
 
03:19:39.290 --> 03:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
to the wisdom of the committee if that's
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
something that you guys want to clarify
 
03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
but I did not know necessarily that that
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
was a distinction thank you
 
03:19:48.170 --> 03:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
the questions representative Shapiro
 
03:19:50.750 --> 03:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:19:52.969 --> 03:19:52.979 align:start position:0%
taking this question so if I understand
 
03:19:56.630 --> 03:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
correctly this is talking about this is
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
um capping the insulin cost at 30 per
 
03:20:01.370 --> 03:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
month for people who
 
03:20:01.380 --> 03:20:02.090 align:start position:0%
month for people who
um

03:20:02.090 --> 03:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:02.100 --> 03:20:06.469 align:start position:0%
um
already

03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:08.450 --> 03:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
not for people who have Medicaid but for
 
03:20:10.490 --> 03:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
people who do not qualify for Medicaid
 
03:20:10.500 --> 03:20:13.429 align:start position:0%
people who do not qualify for Medicaid
are

03:20:13.429 --> 03:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:20:15.290 --> 03:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
um under 300 percent of the federal
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
poverty level and don't have other
 
03:20:18.479 --> 03:20:20.450 align:start position:0%
poverty level and don't have other
insurance

03:20:20.450 --> 03:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:20:22.490 --> 03:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
or even if they do have insurance it
 
03:20:24.349 --> 03:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
still caps the co-payment correct
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
there's not necessarily limiting
 
03:20:27.650 --> 03:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
language in here that would um kick in
 
03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
if they have
 
03:20:31.309 --> 03:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
um Commercial Insurance
 
03:20:33.650 --> 03:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
um but essentially trying to catch that
 
03:20:36.650 --> 03:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
vicious metal uh so my question really
 
03:20:36.660 --> 03:20:38.330 align:start position:0%
vicious metal uh so my question really
is

03:20:38.330 --> 03:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:20:42.530 --> 03:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I know pricing for pharmaceuticals is
 
03:20:42.540 --> 03:20:44.750 align:start position:0%
um I know pricing for pharmaceuticals is
incredibly

03:20:44.750 --> 03:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly
 
03:20:49.690 --> 03:20:49.700 align:start position:0%
bizarre and and subjective and but
 
03:20:52.190 --> 03:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
assuming that there's a cost to someone
 
03:20:54.650 --> 03:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
that goes beyond thirty dollars who's
 
03:20:56.210 --> 03:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
paying that cost
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
is it that is it the state is that the
 
03:21:01.190 --> 03:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacies will not be able to charge
 
03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
more than thirty dollars
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
so where's the cost go right I mean I
 
03:21:08.210 --> 03:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
think that bleeds broaderly uh more
 
03:21:09.950 --> 03:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
broadly into
 
03:21:09.960 --> 03:21:12.230 align:start position:0%
broadly into
um 161.

03:21:12.230 --> 03:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
um 161.
 
03:21:14.750 --> 03:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
um I can grab that really quick
 
03:21:16.910 --> 03:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
um this has to do largely with the
 
03:21:19.910 --> 03:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
rebate program that pharmacies go into
 
03:21:22.849 --> 03:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
um so I I would ask that that question
 
03:21:24.769 --> 03:21:24.779 align:start position:0%
be deferred
 
03:21:27.530 --> 03:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
um to Mr Berry from HHS
 
03:21:28.969 --> 03:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
um just because
 
03:21:31.309 --> 03:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
um I was not as familiar with the rebate
 
03:21:32.809 --> 03:21:32.819 align:start position:0%
as I would like to be
 
03:21:34.490 --> 03:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
um like I said I found out in November
 
03:21:36.170 --> 03:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
that this program existed uh which is
 
03:21:37.309 --> 03:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
really unfortunate because it looks like
 
03:21:38.809 --> 03:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
a really good program
 
03:21:40.610 --> 03:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
um and it would be really good to be
 
03:21:42.180 --> 03:21:42.190 align:start position:0%
able to deliver those savings for folks
 
03:21:42.190 --> 03:21:43.730 align:start position:0%
able to deliver those savings for folks

03:21:43.730 --> 03:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
oh representative Nagel
 
03:21:55.730 --> 03:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just have a real
 
03:21:57.530 --> 03:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
quick question it says in the bill
 
03:21:59.750 --> 03:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
language qualified individuals and I'm
 
03:22:01.730 --> 03:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
trying and I think I understand based on
 
03:22:02.990 --> 03:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
what you said
 
03:22:05.750 --> 03:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
but I don't see what that's referring to
 
03:22:08.690 --> 03:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
within the text that's another thing
 
03:22:10.670 --> 03:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
um I spoke with Mr Berry
 
03:22:13.010 --> 03:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I goofed and I think there may need
 
03:22:15.290 --> 03:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
to be some harmonizing between qualified
 
03:22:17.630 --> 03:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
individual and qualified resident
 
03:22:19.309 --> 03:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I did not catch that during the OLS
 
03:22:21.290 --> 03:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
process but just to make sure that those
 
03:22:23.330 --> 03:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
two things sync up
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
um I think that'd be valuable is that
 
03:22:29.210 --> 03:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:39.290 --> 03:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak as a co-sponsor
 
03:22:46.429 --> 03:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:49.610 --> 03:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
representative short here
 
03:22:49.620 --> 03:22:51.370 align:start position:0%
representative short here
okay

03:22:51.370 --> 03:22:51.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
sure understandable
 
03:23:21.170 --> 03:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:23.510 --> 03:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:23:25.729 --> 03:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
um and thank you honorable members
 
03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
former colleagues
 
03:23:30.889 --> 03:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
the cost I'm here to speak to you about
 
03:23:34.309 --> 03:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 338 my name is Senator
 
03:23:35.809 --> 03:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
Deborah alchillar I represent the
 
03:23:39.650 --> 03:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
Seacoast District 24 the towns of Exeter
 
03:23:41.210 --> 03:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
Greenland Hampton Hampton Falls
 
03:23:44.809 --> 03:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
Northampton rye and stratum the cost of
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
life-saving prescription drugs is one
 
03:23:48.410 --> 03:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
that can put many Granite Staters who
 
03:23:50.210 --> 03:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
are chronically ill in danger of having
 
03:23:53.210 --> 03:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
to make unimaginable choices to maintain
 
03:23:55.070 --> 03:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
their health care and afford it as well
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
in the last 20 years the cost of
 
03:24:00.349 --> 03:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
diabetes drugs has doubled
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
03:24:05.630 --> 03:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
the price of insulin has increased more
 
03:24:08.929 --> 03:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
than now I have put in my testimony 500
 
03:24:11.389 --> 03:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
percent and in fact checking just two
 
03:24:14.030 --> 03:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
minutes ago have been corrected and it
 
03:24:16.670 --> 03:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
is actually 600 percent
 
03:24:18.469 --> 03:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
according to the American Diabetes
 
03:24:20.750 --> 03:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
Association people with type 1 diabetes
 
03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
need on average two to three vials per
 
03:24:24.239 --> 03:24:25.729 align:start position:0%
need on average two to three vials per
month

03:24:25.729 --> 03:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
month
 
03:24:28.250 --> 03:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
for the uninsured and those with poor
 
03:24:30.889 --> 03:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
coverage A month's worth of insulin can
 
03:24:34.010 --> 03:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
cost on average one thousand dollars or
 
03:24:34.020 --> 03:24:34.849 align:start position:0%
cost on average one thousand dollars or
more

03:24:34.849 --> 03:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:24:37.010 --> 03:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
this poses a significant financial
 
03:24:38.929 --> 03:24:38.939 align:start position:0%
burden for patients and their families
 
03:24:41.570 --> 03:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
who need insulin to stay alive for those
 
03:24:43.670 --> 03:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
who may not be intimately acquainted
 
03:24:46.969 --> 03:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
with Diabetes Type 1 is not curable it
 
03:24:49.130 --> 03:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
is a chronic disease managed by daily
 
03:24:52.190 --> 03:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
dosing of insulin people who have the
 
03:24:52.200 --> 03:24:53.750 align:start position:0%
dosing of insulin people who have the
disease

03:24:53.750 --> 03:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
disease
 
03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
are wholly dependent upon prescription
 
03:24:59.389 --> 03:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
drugs to remain alive those prescription
 
03:25:02.090 --> 03:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
drugs are a required purchase for these
 
03:25:05.630 --> 03:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
people even as costs Skyrocket currently
 
03:25:07.910 --> 03:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
there is no alternative to insulin
 
03:25:10.130 --> 03:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
meaning that the drug companies have
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
diabetic patients trapped
 
03:25:15.950 --> 03:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
Diabetes Type 2 often referred to as
 
03:25:18.469 --> 03:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
adult onset diabetes can in some cases
 
03:25:21.110 --> 03:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
be managed with diet and exercise but
 
03:25:24.290 --> 03:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
often patients with type 2 also rely on
 
03:25:24.300 --> 03:25:26.570 align:start position:0%
often patients with type 2 also rely on
insulin

03:25:26.570 --> 03:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
insulin
 
03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
a person
 
03:25:29.809 --> 03:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let you read the rest of
 
03:25:32.809 --> 03:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
that testimony but I wanted to take the
 
03:25:35.150 --> 03:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
last bit of my time to make a couple of
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
clarifications on some questions that
 
03:25:39.469 --> 03:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
were posed by the committee a moment ago
 
03:25:39.479 --> 03:25:42.110 align:start position:0%
were posed by the committee a moment ago
for

03:25:42.110 --> 03:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:25:44.990 --> 03:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
insulin pumps
 
03:25:47.929 --> 03:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
um are considered durable medical
 
03:25:51.469 --> 03:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
equipment they are not what we are
 
03:25:53.210 --> 03:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
talking about in this bill we are
 
03:25:56.769 --> 03:25:56.779 align:start position:0%
talking about the actual insulin itself
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
and insulin
 
03:26:03.410 --> 03:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
the markup on insulin is over 500
 
03:26:05.809 --> 03:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
percent so the
 
03:26:08.750 --> 03:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
um the questions of oh how will we pay
 
03:26:11.210 --> 03:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
for it insulin is actually a very very
 
03:26:14.210 --> 03:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
inexpensive product to produce the
 
03:26:17.090 --> 03:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
markup is on is coming out of the
 
03:26:20.090 --> 03:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and now that we have
 
03:26:20.100 --> 03:26:22.070 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and now that we have
fortunately

03:26:22.070 --> 03:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
fortunately
 
03:26:25.849 --> 03:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
now have bargaining power with the
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies we are hoping
 
03:26:32.210 --> 03:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
that the the prices for some of these
 
03:26:34.630 --> 03:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly marked up and life-saving
 
03:26:36.830 --> 03:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals will be more affordable
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
for states to be purchasing
 
03:26:42.050 --> 03:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you
 
03:26:44.690 --> 03:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
any questions for Senator walsheller
 
03:26:46.610 --> 03:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative Nagle
 
03:26:48.590 --> 03:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
just a quick question oh thank you Mr
 
03:26:50.269 --> 03:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
chairman thank a quick question so
 
03:26:52.070 --> 03:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to cover the insulin that
 
03:26:54.290 --> 03:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
goes into the pump but not the pump
 
03:26:56.929 --> 03:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
right now not everybody uses a pump some
 
03:26:59.750 --> 03:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
people use hypodermic needles um pumps
 
03:26:59.760 --> 03:27:01.429 align:start position:0%
people use hypodermic needles um pumps
are

03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:27:04.010 --> 03:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
pumps and patches are fairly new to the
 
03:27:05.570 --> 03:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
market and they're not suitable or
 
03:27:08.990 --> 03:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate for all patients so that is
 
03:27:11.090 --> 03:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
that is not the intent of the bill the
 
03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is to get the
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
expensive insulin into the hands of the
 
03:27:17.630 --> 03:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
patients who need it
 
03:27:17.640 --> 03:27:18.290 align:start position:0%
patients who need it
um

03:27:18.290 --> 03:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
and we aren't we're not discussing the
 
03:27:23.630 --> 03:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
method of of delivery just getting that
 
03:27:26.330 --> 03:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
insulin to the patients thank you thank
 
03:27:27.830 --> 03:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
you for your question other questions
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:31.920 --> 03:27:33.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:27:33.250 --> 03:27:33.260 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:27:40.370 --> 03:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:42.290 --> 03:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
hey next sign up to testify is Robert
 
03:27:43.670 --> 03:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
Berry from the New Hampshire Department
 
03:27:49.790 --> 03:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:51.290 --> 03:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
03:27:52.790 --> 03:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'll be very brief
 
03:27:54.469 --> 03:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
because I know that there's weather
 
03:27:56.750 --> 03:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
concerns and people are hungry
 
03:27:58.429 --> 03:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:28:00.170 --> 03:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
um essentially what uh representative
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
imagine stated was of the Crux of my
 
03:28:04.729 --> 03:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
testimony I just want to go over a brief
 
03:28:08.510 --> 03:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
test a brief history of the New
 
03:28:12.110 --> 03:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prescription uh drug Advantage
 
03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:13.429 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prescription uh drug Advantage
Program

03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
Program
 
03:28:17.210 --> 03:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
um it was enacted in 2007 due to funding
 
03:28:18.889 --> 03:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
issues we had never been able to
 
03:28:22.370 --> 03:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
operationalize this program in 2019
 
03:28:26.090 --> 03:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
through HB 458 the
 
03:28:28.550 --> 03:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
um the funding mechanism was repealed
 
03:28:30.790 --> 03:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
and that brings us here today
 
03:28:33.950 --> 03:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
essentially as representative agent
 
03:28:37.690 --> 03:28:37.700 align:start position:0%
alluded to the department cannot
 
03:28:40.130 --> 03:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
manage this bill without some funding
 
03:28:42.170 --> 03:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
mechanism so that's the one thing we
 
03:28:43.309 --> 03:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out to the committee
 
03:28:44.630 --> 03:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
other than that I'm happy to take
 
03:28:47.150 --> 03:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
questions and bring them back
 
03:28:49.190 --> 03:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr Berry representative
 
03:28:49.200 --> 03:28:52.250 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr Berry representative
Shapiro

03:28:52.250 --> 03:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:54.290 --> 03:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
taking this question you might have just
 
03:28:57.229 --> 03:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
answered it but I didn't fully
 
03:28:59.450 --> 03:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
understand it so the the difference
 
03:29:01.250 --> 03:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
between thirty dollars a month and a
 
03:29:04.010 --> 03:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month is substantial
 
03:29:05.630 --> 03:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
um and whether
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
whether these drugs are ferociously
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
marked up or not the numbers are still
 
03:29:13.010 --> 03:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
substantial so
 
03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the mechanics of
 
03:29:19.670 --> 03:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
pain for this would be that
 
03:29:19.680 --> 03:29:20.750 align:start position:0%
pain for this would be that
um

03:29:20.750 --> 03:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:23.650 --> 03:29:23.660 align:start position:0%
the previous statute
 
03:29:27.710 --> 03:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
would be revived somehow so that money
 
03:29:29.510 --> 03:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
would come from the state to make up the
 
03:29:31.610 --> 03:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
difference it would have to be revived
 
03:29:34.429 --> 03:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
in yes funding from the legislature
 
03:29:37.370 --> 03:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
would need to follow that yes so would
 
03:29:39.290 --> 03:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
an appropriation have to be in this bill
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
or how would that how would that what
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
would be the mechanics of that be well I
 
03:29:45.950 --> 03:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
think it's up for the to the legislature
 
03:29:48.349 --> 03:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
to cyber the appropriation uh would go
 
03:29:48.359 --> 03:29:50.389 align:start position:0%
to cyber the appropriation uh would go
but

03:29:50.389 --> 03:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have a number to throw out
 
03:29:54.290 --> 03:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
as to what the appropriation would look
 
03:29:55.490 --> 03:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
like we don't really have a point of
 
03:29:57.290 --> 03:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
reference at the department I am working
 
03:29:59.929 --> 03:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
on trying to obtain a number for what it
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
would take to run such a program but
 
03:30:03.950 --> 03:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
just have not been able to do that at
 
03:30:06.590 --> 03:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
this at this juncture thank you
 
03:30:08.690 --> 03:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
03:30:12.769 --> 03:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
for questions my question goes back to
 
03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
the different types of insulin if the
 
03:30:15.590 --> 03:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
department would if they were
 
03:30:16.969 --> 03:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
implementing this would look for
 
03:30:19.849 --> 03:30:19.859 align:start position:0%
injectable insulins continuous insulin
 
03:30:22.370 --> 03:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
pumps or where they would set that bar
 
03:30:24.590 --> 03:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
of where it's important to have state
 
03:30:26.090 --> 03:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
funds make up the difference for people
 
03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
or if it's a matter matter of providing
 
03:30:31.070 --> 03:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
something that is adequate so that's a
 
03:30:32.269 --> 03:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's
 
03:30:33.889 --> 03:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
something I had not personally
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
considered I'm also not familiar with
 
03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
the different various types of insulin
 
03:30:38.929 --> 03:30:38.939 align:start position:0%
so what I would do and I'm going to do
 
03:30:40.610 --> 03:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
is I'm going to take that back to our
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy experts at the department to
 
03:30:44.570 --> 03:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
get a sense as to what that might look
 
03:30:44.580 --> 03:30:45.650 align:start position:0%
get a sense as to what that might look
like

03:30:45.650 --> 03:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:30:47.330 --> 03:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up I'll offer what
 
03:30:49.010 --> 03:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
services I can my job used to be trying
 
03:30:50.630 --> 03:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
to get governments to pay for insulin
 
03:30:53.389 --> 03:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
pumps awesome I will uh take note of
 
03:30:55.190 --> 03:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Mr Berry
 
03:31:03.710 --> 03:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:05.389 --> 03:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
in the last pink card I have this
 
03:31:07.969 --> 03:31:07.979 align:start position:0%
morning or this afternoon uh on this
 
03:31:15.830 --> 03:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:15.840 --> 03:31:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:31:18.229 --> 03:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
microphone please
 
03:31:22.610 --> 03:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
sorry I have testimony to send around I
 
03:31:24.050 --> 03:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
also have
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh a little thing for each of you if you
 
03:31:28.849 --> 03:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
want to take whichever one out of the
 
03:31:30.410 --> 03:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
bag you'd like
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
um I'll explain it in a minute
 
03:31:34.969 --> 03:31:34.979 align:start position:0%
we haven't had lunch is it something we
 
03:31:50.570 --> 03:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
that's okay we've been doing good
 
03:31:56.210 --> 03:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
so first and foremost I would love to
 
03:31:57.889 --> 03:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
answer that question I've been chomping
 
03:31:59.630 --> 03:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
at the bit in terms of insulin and what
 
03:32:00.950 --> 03:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
you would cover
 
03:32:00.960 --> 03:32:02.330 align:start position:0%
you would cover
um

03:32:02.330 --> 03:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:04.250 --> 03:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
first of all I hope my testimony will
 
03:32:06.349 --> 03:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of something different
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
to think about during this bill but also
 
03:32:11.929 --> 03:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
in my experience these bills only cover
 
03:32:15.469 --> 03:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
insulin uh typically on a vial or a pen
 
03:32:18.349 --> 03:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
form and that's just because it's
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
durable medical is going to go to a
 
03:32:21.889 --> 03:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
different piece of insurance altogether
 
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
so durable medical equipment and
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
prescription benefits are usually two
 
03:32:27.710 --> 03:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
separate things anyways
 
03:32:27.720 --> 03:32:28.370 align:start position:0%
separate things anyways
um

03:32:28.370 --> 03:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
and also we don't want to be greedy
 
03:32:32.750 --> 03:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
um really I'm just we're just looking
 
03:32:35.690 --> 03:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
for affordable insulin I would love to
 
03:32:37.969 --> 03:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
have the conversation of how to get cgms
 
03:32:40.429 --> 03:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
and Insulin pumps covered but I would
 
03:32:42.290 --> 03:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
settle for just the medication I need to
 
03:32:42.300 --> 03:32:43.190 align:start position:0%
settle for just the medication I need to
live

03:32:43.190 --> 03:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
live
 
03:32:43.200 --> 03:32:43.969 align:start position:0%
live
um

03:32:43.969 --> 03:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:45.710 --> 03:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
with that being said I did write a
 
03:32:45.720 --> 03:32:46.969 align:start position:0%
with that being said I did write a
testimony

03:32:46.969 --> 03:32:46.979 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:32:48.769 --> 03:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
I know you're short on time I will try
 
03:32:51.530 --> 03:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
to be quick on it but it helps me stick
 
03:32:52.910 --> 03:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
to my point
 
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:32:56.690 --> 03:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
my name is Brittany O'Donnell I am the
 
03:32:58.190 --> 03:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chapter leader for T1
 
03:32:59.809 --> 03:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
International which is a global
 
03:33:02.269 --> 03:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization that works
 
03:33:03.889 --> 03:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
towards affordability and accessibility
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
of insulin today I am here to offer my
 
03:33:09.469 --> 03:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
support of HB 338 as well as ideas for
 
03:33:11.210 --> 03:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
how to ensure it truly helps the most
 
03:33:13.130 --> 03:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rights affected by the
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
insulin price crisis I'm sure that you
 
03:33:16.910 --> 03:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
may be able to think of someone you know
 
03:33:18.469 --> 03:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
or love who is living with diabetes
 
03:33:21.650 --> 03:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
there are 26.8 million diagnosed
 
03:33:23.690 --> 03:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
diabetics in the U.S making your odds
 
03:33:24.889 --> 03:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
one in ten
 
03:33:27.650 --> 03:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
if you can't think of anyone allow me to
 
03:33:30.349 --> 03:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
introduce myself I have been living with
 
03:33:32.570 --> 03:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
type 1 diabetes since 1990 when I was
 
03:33:35.090 --> 03:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
diagnosed at 13 months old I lived
 
03:33:36.710 --> 03:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
through my mom pureeing meals from
 
03:33:38.090 --> 03:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
Weight Watchers
 
03:33:40.370 --> 03:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
that was the only diabetic diet that
 
03:33:41.870 --> 03:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
they had for conversion at the time
 
03:33:44.090 --> 03:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
blood sugar monitors that took over a
 
03:33:45.950 --> 03:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
minute to produce results assuming that
 
03:33:47.570 --> 03:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
you put just the perfect amount of Blood
 
03:33:50.330 --> 03:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
on the test strip and most notably I
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
survived off insulins that were derived
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
from Pig and Cattle
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
when Humalog insulin was released in
 
03:33:58.610 --> 03:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
1996 there was a seismic shift in the
 
03:34:00.349 --> 03:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
way diabetes was treated as it was
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
finally offered and it finally had
 
03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
offered enough predictability to also
 
03:34:06.590 --> 03:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
provide hope for the diabetic community
 
03:34:09.469 --> 03:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
and their caretakers that is until it
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
became a medication so expensive that it
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
is now unobtainable without great
 
03:34:15.710 --> 03:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
insurance or a healthy disposable income
 
03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
since the 1990s the cost of insulin has
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
increased over 1200 percent yet the cost
 
03:34:24.349 --> 03:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
of production for a vial of most analog
 
03:34:27.410 --> 03:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
insulin which is NovoLog Humalog the
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
fast acting insulin you need to cover
 
03:34:30.889 --> 03:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
anything that you eat or a high blood
 
03:34:30.899 --> 03:34:31.849 align:start position:0%
anything that you eat or a high blood
sugar

03:34:31.849 --> 03:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
sugar
 
03:34:35.210 --> 03:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
it costs only between 3.69 and six
 
03:34:37.250 --> 03:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
dollars and sixteen cents to make
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
for those unfamiliar insulin is an
 
03:34:40.969 --> 03:34:40.979 align:start position:0%
absolute necessity especially with those
 
03:34:43.309 --> 03:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
with type 1 diabetes where your pancreas
 
03:34:45.410 --> 03:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
no longer produces it insulin helps
 
03:34:47.090 --> 03:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
blood sugar enter the body cells to
 
03:34:49.010 --> 03:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
create energy using insulin is
 
03:34:51.650 --> 03:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
meticulous with some training you are
 
03:34:53.389 --> 03:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
expected to be a mathematician a
 
03:34:55.190 --> 03:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
dietitian and make life or death
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
decisions daily somehow diabetics around
 
03:34:59.570 --> 03:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
the world not only manage this but do so
 
03:35:01.490 --> 03:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
while holding down full-time jobs and
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
supporting families
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
quite simply without insulin we die
 
03:35:08.030 --> 03:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
there is no grease in it and oftentimes
 
03:35:10.250 --> 03:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's slow and painful it's a condition
 
03:35:12.950 --> 03:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
known as diabetic ketoacidosis or DKI
 
03:35:14.690 --> 03:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
when you hear about diabetics who have
 
03:35:16.250 --> 03:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
died due to rationing there is no
 
03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
justice done for what they actually went
 
03:35:17.880 --> 03:35:18.650 align:start position:0%
justice done for what they actually went
through

03:35:18.650 --> 03:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:35:21.050 --> 03:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
with dka your body slowly deteriorates
 
03:35:23.630 --> 03:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
your liver eats away at fat for fuel you
 
03:35:25.370 --> 03:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
have a general feeling of weakness and
 
03:35:27.469 --> 03:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
illness and though it can occur within
 
03:35:29.630 --> 03:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
24 hours it can take days for untreated
 
03:35:31.849 --> 03:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
Decay to claim the life
 
03:35:33.650 --> 03:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
described by those who have experienced
 
03:35:36.170 --> 03:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
it as burning or your blood feeling like
 
03:35:38.690 --> 03:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
it's on fire it is actually the blood in
 
03:35:40.790 --> 03:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
your body turning to acid
 
03:35:42.950 --> 03:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
those who go to the hospital can expect
 
03:35:44.690 --> 03:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
to accumulate an average bill of about
 
03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars to treat it and
 
03:35:47.630 --> 03:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
be released
 
03:35:49.370 --> 03:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
I would also expect those numbers to
 
03:35:51.950 --> 03:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
have changed that came from a 2001 study
 
03:35:54.429 --> 03:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
I had read in a medical journal
 
03:35:57.290 --> 03:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
over the last year with difficulties in
 
03:35:59.269 --> 03:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
hospital Staffing and challenges faced
 
03:36:00.889 --> 03:36:00.899 align:start position:0%
by patients and being able to find
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals equipped to care for them
 
03:36:08.150 --> 03:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
so what can HB 338 do if properly funded
 
03:36:10.010 --> 03:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
the bill has an incredible opportunity
 
03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
to help people who even with the copay
 
03:36:15.050 --> 03:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
cap in place can't afford insulin it has
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to help people who are too
 
03:36:18.290 --> 03:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
ashamed to ask for help because for a
 
03:36:19.849 --> 03:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
lot of people who ration their insulin
 
03:36:21.889 --> 03:36:21.899 align:start position:0%
it feels embarrassing to ask for help to
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
afford a medication that is as vital to
 
03:36:26.269 --> 03:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
living as air itself
 
03:36:27.830 --> 03:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
it can help people who are in between
 
03:36:30.530 --> 03:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
jobs relationships or whatever other
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
transitional period life tends to throw
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
at us when we are least expecting it
 
03:36:37.070 --> 03:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
has the potential to help people who are
 
03:36:38.990 --> 03:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
in the position I was in when I ration
 
03:36:41.210 --> 03:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
my insulin the only reason I'm here
 
03:36:42.950 --> 03:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
today to talk to you is because there
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
were only three months between my 26th
 
03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
birthday and the day I got married
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
I had a high deductible on the plan I
 
03:36:51.050 --> 03:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
went on after aging off of my dad's
 
03:36:53.530 --> 03:36:53.540 align:start position:0%
insurance and even with the coupon I was
 
03:36:56.570 --> 03:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
graciously told about by the pharmacist
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
I was only able to pick up one vial of
 
03:37:01.010 --> 03:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
insulin at a time I stretched it for as
 
03:37:02.990 --> 03:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
long as I could I found old vials with
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
expired insulin around the house I opted
 
03:37:07.070 --> 03:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
for lower carb meals so I wouldn't have
 
03:37:09.170 --> 03:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
to use too much insulin and I let my
 
03:37:10.670 --> 03:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
blood sugars run higher than I normally
 
03:37:12.530 --> 03:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
would to avoid running out
 
03:37:14.929 --> 03:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
I never told anyone what I was doing but
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
I did sleep easier when I was able to go
 
03:37:18.950 --> 03:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
on my husband's insurance
 
03:37:20.929 --> 03:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
in researching what this bill has the
 
03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
potential to do I would be remiss if I
 
03:37:25.250 --> 03:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
didn't acknowledge my concerns about
 
03:37:26.990 --> 03:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
what would happen if it's not properly
 
03:37:29.030 --> 03:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
funded the New Hampshire prep
 
03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
prescription card on which this bill
 
03:37:32.450 --> 03:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
relies was never given the
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations following its
 
03:37:36.530 --> 03:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
establishment in 2007. it's also not
 
03:37:38.330 --> 03:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
very user friendly from what I found on
 
03:37:40.849 --> 03:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
the website and some of the programs
 
03:37:43.010 --> 03:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
only cover medications for type 2
 
03:37:43.020 --> 03:37:44.389 align:start position:0%
only cover medications for type 2
diabetes

03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
diabetes
 
03:37:47.210 --> 03:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
which is a whole different conversation
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
but if we're talking about type 2
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
diabetes as a preventative medication we
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
should be talking about type 1
 
03:37:54.830 --> 03:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
medications as preventative medication
 
03:37:57.769 --> 03:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
for things like dka and all of those
 
03:38:02.090 --> 03:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
other things amputations that go with it
 
03:38:02.100 --> 03:38:02.809 align:start position:0%
other things amputations that go with it
um

03:38:02.809 --> 03:38:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:04.849 --> 03:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
for it to be successful funding for New
 
03:38:06.229 --> 03:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prescription card would have
 
03:38:08.450 --> 03:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
to be included and Insulin would have to
 
03:38:10.490 --> 03:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
be guaranteed coverage by the program
 
03:38:12.290 --> 03:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
with a bill that offers so much promise
 
03:38:13.969 --> 03:38:13.979 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to share a different
 
03:38:15.530 --> 03:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
approach to the same problem I could ask
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
you to start wrapping up yep sure I have
 
03:38:19.729 --> 03:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
one more paragraph
 
03:38:23.389 --> 03:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
in 2020 Utah passed HB 207 and created
 
03:38:25.210 --> 03:38:25.220 align:start position:0%
the Utah insulin Savings Program
 
03:38:27.410 --> 03:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
recognizing the dangers of rationing
 
03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
Republican representative Norm Thurston
 
03:38:31.190 --> 03:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
negotiated a set price with Express
 
03:38:32.570 --> 03:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
Scripts where the state could buy
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
insulin in bulk at one set price
 
03:38:37.010 --> 03:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
which they would then pass along to the
 
03:38:38.690 --> 03:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
people who signed up for the program at
 
03:38:40.429 --> 03:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
that same price given that Express
 
03:38:42.469 --> 03:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
Scripts has a relationship here in New
 
03:38:44.450 --> 03:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with its state employees
 
03:38:46.250 --> 03:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
as they are currently working with the
 
03:38:47.330 --> 03:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's prescription drug
 
03:38:49.010 --> 03:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
affordability board they may be
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
interested in setting up a similar
 
03:38:53.450 --> 03:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
program as Utah's the Utah Savings
 
03:38:55.190 --> 03:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
Program is open to all residents of the
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
state with the only exception being if
 
03:38:58.849 --> 03:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
you are an employee of the state I did
 
03:39:01.250 --> 03:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
give you the website in my testimony
 
03:39:03.410 --> 03:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
the Savings Program had bipartisan
 
03:39:04.849 --> 03:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
support and passed both the House and
 
03:39:06.290 --> 03:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
Senate with ease before it was signed
 
03:39:08.210 --> 03:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
into law less than two months after its
 
03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
introduction it was created to do
 
03:39:12.469 --> 03:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
exactly what this is looking to do which
 
03:39:14.150 --> 03:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
has helped those with no insurance or a
 
03:39:16.370 --> 03:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
large deductible with 8.3 Americans
 
03:39:18.590 --> 03:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
uninsured and 47 percent having high
 
03:39:20.330 --> 03:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
deductible plans there are many who need
 
03:39:21.229 --> 03:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
this help
 
03:39:23.090 --> 03:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
I'm here today because I survived
 
03:39:24.769 --> 03:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
insulin rationing and I owe it to those
 
03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
who did not to do better one important
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
diabetics in the United States will
 
03:39:31.370 --> 03:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
ration their insulin so statistically
 
03:39:32.990 --> 03:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
speaking you know someone who is
 
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
rationing or has rash in their insulin
 
03:39:37.429 --> 03:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
as much as I take my response my
 
03:39:39.650 --> 03:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
survival as a responsibility I hope you
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
take this opportunity to help save lives
 
03:39:43.790 --> 03:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue it's a
 
03:39:45.290 --> 03:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
human issue and I hope to have your
 
03:39:45.300 --> 03:39:46.849 align:start position:0%
human issue and I hope to have your
support

03:39:46.849 --> 03:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:39:48.050 --> 03:39:48.060 align:start position:0%

03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%

thank you for the record representative
 
03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
Alicia leckis Hillsboro 38 which is the
 
03:40:40.490 --> 03:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
photorial between Hudson and Litchfield
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
um whenever I meet new constituents I
 
03:40:45.410 --> 03:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
always say so I'm one of your reps do
 
03:40:48.130 --> 03:40:48.140 align:start position:0%
you have any concerns questions
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
complaints and if it's a business person
 
03:40:53.929 --> 03:40:53.939 align:start position:0%
I say I ask are there things that are in
 
03:40:55.729 --> 03:40:55.739 align:start position:0%
law which interfere with you're doing
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
your business or conducting your job or
 
03:41:00.950 --> 03:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
whatever so when I got my new primary
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
care physician who is a nurse
 
03:41:05.870 --> 03:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
practitioner I ask her that question she
 
03:41:08.570 --> 03:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
said let me get back to you in
 
03:41:11.690 --> 03:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
um at my next physical she said actually
 
03:41:14.210 --> 03:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
I have a few things for you and this was
 
03:41:17.570 --> 03:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
one of them and basically she said I can
 
03:41:20.809 --> 03:41:20.819 align:start position:0%
prescribe drugs that can kill you but I
 
03:41:23.450 --> 03:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
can't prescribe diabetic shoes
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
so I I went to research and you know try
 
03:41:29.090 --> 03:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
to figure that out and this bill came
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
out of that somebody just recently said
 
03:41:33.590 --> 03:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
to me what if instead of diabetic shoes
 
03:41:36.290 --> 03:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
it said medical devices if you want to
 
03:41:38.150 --> 03:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
do that that's certainly fine with me as
 
03:41:39.950 --> 03:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
long as there isn't an exception in law
 
03:41:42.889 --> 03:41:42.899 align:start position:0%
already for diabetic shoes
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm in education
 
03:41:48.290 --> 03:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
so I don't know I'm just trying to help
 
03:41:51.110 --> 03:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
my nurse practitioner and anybody else
 
03:41:53.570 --> 03:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
and her comment was there are plenty of
 
03:41:56.030 --> 03:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
offices where there are just nurse
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
practitioners not
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
um medical doctors and if a patient
 
03:42:04.849 --> 03:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
comes to her and needs this she that
 
03:42:07.250 --> 03:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
they would then have to set up an
 
03:42:08.750 --> 03:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
appointment with a doctor they'd never
 
03:42:10.969 --> 03:42:10.979 align:start position:0%
met as a first
 
03:42:14.030 --> 03:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
you know as a as
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
brain failure uh you know when you first
 
03:42:19.849 --> 03:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
see a doctor whatever that is and and go
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
over all of that stuff and pay all that
 
03:42:23.570 --> 03:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
extra money to a doctor they don't even
 
03:42:26.330 --> 03:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
have never seen so they can get their
 
03:42:28.610 --> 03:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
prescription for diabetic shoes rather
 
03:42:31.010 --> 03:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
than just having their primary care
 
03:42:33.170 --> 03:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
physician who deals with their diabetes
 
03:42:36.410 --> 03:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
and prescribes their medicine to be able
 
03:42:38.750 --> 03:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
to prescribe that and that's all I have
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
to say but I will try to answer
 
03:42:42.889 --> 03:42:42.899 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them thank you
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
03:42:48.650 --> 03:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:42:50.570 --> 03:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
so these
 
03:42:53.450 --> 03:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
um physician assistants and nurse
 
03:42:55.610 --> 03:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
practitioners they already have the
 
03:42:59.389 --> 03:42:59.399 align:start position:0%
legal authority to prescribe medication
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
um but they supposedly don't have the
 
03:43:05.210 --> 03:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
ability to prescribe diabetic shoes why
 
03:43:08.150 --> 03:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
there must be some law already written
 
03:43:11.090 --> 03:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
or something that prohibits that why
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't we instead of adding new words to
 
03:43:16.010 --> 03:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
the code why don't we just scratch out
 
03:43:18.530 --> 03:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
the old words that are somehow
 
03:43:21.889 --> 03:43:21.899 align:start position:0%
preventing the you know prescription of
 
03:43:23.870 --> 03:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
diabetic shoes and other ridiculous
 
03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
things that should be legal
 
03:43:28.910 --> 03:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
I like removing code not settings I
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
agree with you and that's entirely I'd
 
03:43:34.370 --> 03:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
be thrilled with that this is the law
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
that came the bill that came out when I
 
03:43:39.650 --> 03:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
went to research and then research
 
03:43:42.889 --> 03:43:42.899 align:start position:0%
talked to Ola you know this is what they
 
03:43:44.929 --> 03:43:44.939 align:start position:0%
came up with when I went and said this
 
03:43:48.590 --> 03:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
is a problem how do we fix it so
 
03:43:51.410 --> 03:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
and as I said I'm education I don't
 
03:43:53.090 --> 03:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
understand what all the Health and Human
 
03:43:56.090 --> 03:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
Services laws are but if you do please
 
03:44:00.170 --> 03:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:04.130 --> 03:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.870 --> 03:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
isn't the answer to the previous
 
03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
question that this is not governed by
 
03:44:10.130 --> 03:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
law but governed by the scope of
 
03:44:13.309 --> 03:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
practice of an individual practice and
 
03:44:15.469 --> 03:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
therefore it's not a law subject to
 
03:44:18.590 --> 03:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
being repealed what we need to do if we
 
03:44:21.290 --> 03:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
choose to do this is to add this to the
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
scope of practice for this particular
 
03:44:23.399 --> 03:44:24.830 align:start position:0%
scope of practice for this particular
practitioner

03:44:24.830 --> 03:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
if that's actually what's stopping it
 
03:44:31.370 --> 03:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
yes that will be what we need to do it
 
03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
may be Medicaid or Medicare
 
03:44:36.650 --> 03:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
that is saying that in order to do this
 
03:44:39.889 --> 03:44:39.899 align:start position:0%
so like I said I don't know but yes
 
03:44:42.650 --> 03:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
whatever needs to be done amend it
 
03:44:45.469 --> 03:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
however you have to and if there are
 
03:44:48.110 --> 03:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
other silly things out there get rid of
 
03:44:49.849 --> 03:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
them too please
 
03:44:49.859 --> 03:44:51.830 align:start position:0%
them too please
representative

03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:44:58.130 --> 03:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
for taking my question or I think one of
 
03:44:59.809 --> 03:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
the problems that this does have to do
 
03:45:02.570 --> 03:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
with Medicare it it you bring the thing
 
03:45:04.849 --> 03:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
that you bring up has been a
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
sewerpoint for years because a lot of
 
03:45:09.530 --> 03:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
the durable medical equipment and other
 
03:45:12.110 --> 03:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
things physician assistance and nurse
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
practitioners aren't haven't been
 
03:45:15.830 --> 03:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to prescribe but that's by
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare regulation and I think there's
 
03:45:20.990 --> 03:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
been some loosening up with that so my
 
03:45:24.170 --> 03:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
question for is I For Me Maybe is to go
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
and look and see if that would allow
 
03:45:28.429 --> 03:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
because we can make a law here but if
 
03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
Medicare isn't going to allow it it's
 
03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
not going to matter so I think that's
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
what we need to find out thank you for
 
03:45:37.190 --> 03:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
03:45:39.290 --> 03:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
03:45:41.570 --> 03:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative I
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
definitely understand the constraints
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
around Medicare but do you think it
 
03:45:46.010 --> 03:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
would be important to offer it up to
 
03:45:47.809 --> 03:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
patients on Commercial Insurance or cash
 
03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
pay if they wanted to shoe better suited
 
03:45:52.190 --> 03:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
to reduce amputations absolutely
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
anything that's going to help and
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
anything you guys know how to do and I
 
03:45:59.150 --> 03:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you looking at this
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
03:46:03.110 --> 03:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
um this bill really surprised me because
 
03:46:08.330 --> 03:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
did you actually look through the scope
 
03:46:11.150 --> 03:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
of practice for nurse practitioners I
 
03:46:15.769 --> 03:46:15.779 align:start position:0%
went to research OLS research and I
 
03:46:18.170 --> 03:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
asked them and they gave me some things
 
03:46:21.550 --> 03:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
but there was it just said
 
03:46:23.870 --> 03:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
MDS only
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't know
 
03:46:27.950 --> 03:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
but at any rate they said they did a lot
 
03:46:29.630 --> 03:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
of research which they only sent me part
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
of they said so when I put in the bill
 
03:46:32.809 --> 03:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
with OLS
 
03:46:35.330 --> 03:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
they will be happy to work with OLS so
 
03:46:37.490 --> 03:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
they did that and this is what came out
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
to me so I don't know what all the ins
 
03:46:43.910 --> 03:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
and outs are because they communicated
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah I was going to try to
 
03:46:48.050 --> 03:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
look drag up the nurse practitioner
 
03:46:50.269 --> 03:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
rules to see that because my that
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
surprised me that they can't write them
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
now and just so we acknowledge who's the
 
03:46:56.870 --> 03:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
hero in this um I as a doctor they as an
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner write a prescription
 
03:47:00.769 --> 03:47:00.779 align:start position:0%
the pedorthist actually makes the device
 
03:47:02.210 --> 03:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who really know what
 
03:47:05.210 --> 03:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
they're doing and and um for them to
 
03:47:07.130 --> 03:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
write a prescription for it's not a big
 
03:47:07.140 --> 03:47:08.210 align:start position:0%
write a prescription for it's not a big
deal

03:47:08.210 --> 03:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
deal
 
03:47:10.790 --> 03:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
which I'm shocked it's not allowed well
 
03:47:13.490 --> 03:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
my my PCP was shocked that it was not
 
03:47:13.500 --> 03:47:15.050 align:start position:0%
my my PCP was shocked that it was not
allowed

03:47:15.050 --> 03:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
03:47:17.809 --> 03:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
 
03:47:20.330 --> 03:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
03:47:21.769 --> 03:47:21.779 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:47:24.650 --> 03:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
question uh would you believe that the
 
03:47:28.490 --> 03:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
language here is being inserted into the
 
03:47:31.809 --> 03:47:31.819 align:start position:0%
um the nurse Practice Act in the um
 
03:47:35.110 --> 03:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistance scope of practice
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
so it is in the in the place that we're
 
03:47:40.370 --> 03:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but because I would
 
03:47:44.929 --> 03:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
you be agreeable to like amending it to
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
broaden it to other devices I would be
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
amenable to anything that's going to get
 
03:47:53.150 --> 03:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
patients the care they need thank you
 
03:47:54.590 --> 03:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:59.330 --> 03:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.070 --> 03:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
the point of order representative Leon
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman as a point of
 
03:48:04.969 --> 03:48:04.979 align:start position:0%
order I think we all slip back into the
 
03:48:06.650 --> 03:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
sort of discussing through questions and
 
03:48:09.410 --> 03:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
what I know I was guilty of that as well
 
03:48:10.670 --> 03:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
um hopefully we'll try and keep things
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
more focused in the future even though
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
this was beneficial right now
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
see none representatively because thank
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:28.190 --> 03:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
he also signed up to testify is a
 
03:48:31.250 --> 03:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards
 
03:48:31.260 --> 03:48:32.330 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards
foreign

03:48:32.330 --> 03:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I didn't really
 
03:48:37.010 --> 03:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
intend to testify on this I was waiting
 
03:48:38.690 --> 03:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
for my own bill later but as I was
 
03:48:40.429 --> 03:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
listening to this
 
03:48:42.290 --> 03:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
um the the one thing that I thought
 
03:48:44.809 --> 03:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
might be useful to the committee that uh
 
03:48:47.210 --> 03:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
maybe this is their first term is that
 
03:48:50.870 --> 03:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
we have a trend of multiple terms trying
 
03:48:55.550 --> 03:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
to open up access to care to make it
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
more easy for patients to get access
 
03:49:01.250 --> 03:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
like for example last term we passed one
 
03:49:04.370 --> 03:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
saying that a person can go order their
 
03:49:04.380 --> 03:49:05.530 align:start position:0%
saying that a person can go order their
own

03:49:05.530 --> 03:49:05.540 align:start position:0%
own
 
03:49:08.570 --> 03:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
diagnostic pathology test without an
 
03:49:12.769 --> 03:49:12.779 align:start position:0%
order uh and and and so so the to the
 
03:49:14.570 --> 03:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
extent that this is consistent with that
 
03:49:17.210 --> 03:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
Trend I think it's fully supportable or
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
I hope we can support it and then the
 
03:49:22.250 --> 03:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
other part is that I have uh I got
 
03:49:23.870 --> 03:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
another little Bill that I'm coming to
 
03:49:26.030 --> 03:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
you with that I had overlooked one of
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
the practitioners of a health care in
 
03:49:31.190 --> 03:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in in my bill and so they
 
03:49:33.170 --> 03:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
asked me to come back and think and get
 
03:49:36.490 --> 03:49:36.500 align:start position:0%
them at it so so my point there is
 
03:49:40.190 --> 03:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
these two types of care providers may be
 
03:49:43.370 --> 03:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
necessary but not sufficient and since
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is in an early bill you know maybe
 
03:49:48.290 --> 03:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
maybe there's time to do a little bit
 
03:49:50.929 --> 03:49:50.939 align:start position:0%
more research and an amendment to make
 
03:49:52.490 --> 03:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
sure that you're comfortable with it I'd
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
be happy to work with any representative
 
03:49:57.229 --> 03:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
on that even though I'm not a co-sponsor
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
here thank you representative
 
03:50:02.929 --> 03:50:02.939 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments or primary
 
03:50:04.490 --> 03:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
questions represent Dr Nagel
 
03:50:06.650 --> 03:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
03:50:11.210 --> 03:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
there's other doctors here no I know
 
03:50:13.190 --> 03:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
um the only problem that I see with this
 
03:50:15.229 --> 03:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
bill at all because I think it's it's
 
03:50:17.330 --> 03:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
sad that it's not
 
03:50:19.010 --> 03:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
doable now
 
03:50:21.050 --> 03:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
the number of durable medical supply
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
devices that we're talking about is
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
immense so are we going to just add them
 
03:50:27.050 --> 03:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
one by one by one by one by one and
 
03:50:28.610 --> 03:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
right now most of the health care
 
03:50:30.650 --> 03:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
Primary Care are substantial percentage
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
of it is increasingly be done by nurse
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
practitioners and Physicians assistants
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
and it's important that they have the
 
03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
skills or the abilities to be able to
 
03:50:41.690 --> 03:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
provide these services so I'm
 
03:50:44.090 --> 03:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm I I would like to think that there's
 
03:50:46.250 --> 03:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
a way to work this in more broadly than
 
03:50:48.590 --> 03:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
just that and not have to come back here
 
03:50:51.530 --> 03:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
every year to add another one
 
03:50:54.950 --> 03:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards okay so there's a
 
03:50:57.050 --> 03:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
I think a question in there and I I and
 
03:50:59.330 --> 03:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
and my answer the answer to the question
 
03:51:00.889 --> 03:51:00.899 align:start position:0%
I heard
 
03:51:05.450 --> 03:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
is is is is is I agree this feels to me
 
03:51:08.929 --> 03:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
like it's a very small shot at what
 
03:51:10.849 --> 03:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
could probably be handled in a more
 
03:51:14.510 --> 03:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
broad sense and as somebody who needs an
 
03:51:18.229 --> 03:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
orthotic for my ankle I I I know that
 
03:51:20.690 --> 03:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
the Specialty Care resides in the people
 
03:51:23.330 --> 03:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
who make the brace and not and that's
 
03:51:25.130 --> 03:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
not the magic isn't in the prescription
 
03:51:27.349 --> 03:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
the magic is in the person who fits you
 
03:51:27.359 --> 03:51:28.490 align:start position:0%
the magic is in the person who fits you
so

03:51:28.490 --> 03:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:30.830 --> 03:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Weber point of procedure
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
while I'm very much in sympathy with the
 
03:51:38.210 --> 03:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
idea of broadening
 
03:51:40.370 --> 03:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
areas of practice
 
03:51:43.130 --> 03:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make the point that if
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
we take this particular Bill and start
 
03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
adding a lot of different things on it
 
03:51:50.090 --> 03:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
we're either going to need to have a
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
whole other public hearing so that the
 
03:51:53.809 --> 03:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
public gets notice of what we're doing
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
or we could use it to set up some kind
 
03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
of study
 
03:52:00.769 --> 03:52:00.779 align:start position:0%
or without having a bill at all either
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
you as chair you as chairman of this
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee could appoint some people to
 
03:52:08.030 --> 03:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
study the issue so there's lots of ways
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
of doing that I just wanted to caution
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
people about putting 18 more devices or
 
03:52:17.210 --> 03:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
categories of devices onto a bill
 
03:52:19.490 --> 03:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
without the appropriate public hearing
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
on it
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh because I I don't want people to
 
03:52:25.010 --> 03:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
waste all that good work for something
 
03:52:27.110 --> 03:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
that then is going to be run across a
 
03:52:28.490 --> 03:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
procedural there's an amendment we're
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
offer though would not have to have a
 
03:52:32.210 --> 03:52:32.220 align:start position:0%
public hearing by itself or we don't
 
03:52:33.710 --> 03:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
normally have public hearings on
 
03:52:35.389 --> 03:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
amendments we offer amendments all the
 
03:52:37.610 --> 03:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
time without public hearings thank you
 
03:52:40.849 --> 03:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
it it the question is how far it Strays
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
from the original intent of the bill and
 
03:52:46.190 --> 03:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
how much members of the public who might
 
03:52:48.530 --> 03:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
have something to tell us about it get
 
03:52:50.929 --> 03:52:50.939 align:start position:0%
notice of what we're doing it's more
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
honored I'm afraid in the breach than in
 
03:52:54.830 --> 03:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
the observance
 
03:52:56.510 --> 03:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:58.670 --> 03:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
anything else any other questions for
 
03:53:03.229 --> 03:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:05.210 --> 03:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman are we representative on
 
03:53:08.690 --> 03:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
Bill 413 yes one of the things if I
 
03:53:08.700 --> 03:53:09.469 align:start position:0%
Bill 413 yes one of the things if I
could

03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:53:11.570 --> 03:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation to the
 
03:53:13.729 --> 03:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
representative there I went back and
 
03:53:15.769 --> 03:53:15.779 align:start position:0%
looked at the physician assistance
 
03:53:19.370 --> 03:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
chapter they can according to the RSA
 
03:53:19.380 --> 03:53:22.190 align:start position:0%
chapter they can according to the RSA
318d3b

03:53:22.190 --> 03:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
318d3b
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
prescribed for devices
 
03:53:28.550 --> 03:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
this is clearly the device number two
 
03:53:31.190 --> 03:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
is that if you simply add a language
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
under the current statute which is 326 B
 
03:53:38.030 --> 03:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
11 which have copies of four people here
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
is simply where it says they have the
 
03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:41.750 align:start position:0%
is simply where it says they have the
authority

03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
authority
 
03:53:43.370 --> 03:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
to prescribe control and uncontrolled
 
03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
drugs is at that point in time just add
 
03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
a simple thing and devices like you do
 
03:53:49.370 --> 03:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
with a PA
 
03:53:51.050 --> 03:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
versus trying to get into a Litany of
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
what they can and cannot do
 
03:53:56.510 --> 03:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
another procedural thing is this not a
 
03:53:58.130 --> 03:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
matter for either a work session or a
 
03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or an executive session I
 
03:54:02.990 --> 03:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
would say or discussion among any number
 
03:54:05.450 --> 03:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
of members of this committee less than a
 
03:54:07.729 --> 03:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
quorum who could just go off and talk
 
03:54:09.530 --> 03:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
about it and bring back an amendment
 
03:54:12.650 --> 03:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
quite well taken thank you
 
03:54:14.870 --> 03:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
all right no other questions or comments
 
03:54:16.969 --> 03:54:16.979 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards thank
 
03:54:19.190 --> 03:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I've been getting mentored
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
by representative Weber now for five
 
03:54:23.929 --> 03:54:23.939 align:start position:0%
years so it's good to continue the
 
03:54:27.650 --> 03:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
education a lot of experience thank you
 
03:54:31.130 --> 03:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
okay good to see my old seat mate
 
03:54:34.070 --> 03:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
our next bill is um
 
03:54:36.349 --> 03:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
for one o'clock by not having lunch
 
03:54:37.490 --> 03:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
we're actually a little ahead of
 
03:54:37.500 --> 03:54:38.330 align:start position:0%
we're actually a little ahead of
schedule

03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
and as I understood
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly so if somebody wants to
 
03:54:44.929 --> 03:54:44.939 align:start position:0%
people want to get up and stretch a
 
03:54:47.870 --> 03:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
little bit close the hearing foreign yes
 
03:54:50.150 --> 03:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh and with no one else had to testify
 
03:54:52.130 --> 03:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
in 413 I will
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry did somebody have a question
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing
 
03:55:01.330 --> 03:55:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:04.070 --> 03:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
if you need to go and get something to
 
03:55:05.510 --> 03:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
eat that's fine but we're not family
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
breaking for lunch now so I'm going to
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HP 413 and
 
03:55:13.010 --> 03:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
we'll reconvene in a few minutes for at
 
03:55:15.889 --> 03:55:15.899 align:start position:0%
one o'clock for HB 329.
 
03:55:23.450 --> 03:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.090 --> 04:11:13.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:17.520 --> 04:11:18.729 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:11:18.729 --> 04:11:18.739 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
as as as things often happen in
 
04:11:22.849 --> 04:11:22.859 align:start position:0%
government you say you're going to take
 
04:11:24.650 --> 04:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
five minutes you take 15 but that's good
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
but that's okay we had a long morning
 
04:11:28.969 --> 04:11:28.979 align:start position:0%
and a busy morning and I appreciate
 
04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
everybody's Indulgence
 
04:11:33.530 --> 04:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
with that I am going to open the public
 
04:11:37.490 --> 04:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
hearing for HB 329
 
04:11:39.889 --> 04:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
and I'd like I would recognize the prime
 
04:11:42.650 --> 04:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Jim Murphy
 
04:11:45.889 --> 04:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
great good afternoon now everybody uh
 
04:11:47.210 --> 04:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
and good afternoon and thank you Mr
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
chairman in um honorable committee
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
members for HHS and Ena
 
04:11:54.710 --> 04:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
for allowing me the opportunity to
 
04:11:56.570 --> 04:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
present this bill which has been
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
presented before as you all may know uh
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill 329 with a
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached establishing an a
 
04:12:07.130 --> 04:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
myotrophic lateral sclerosis registry in
 
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Jim Murphy I
 
04:12:14.330 --> 04:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
represent Grafton 12 which is lime in
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
Hanover uh in in my second term where I
 
04:12:19.309 --> 04:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
worked previously in ways and means so
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy to be in a place where
 
04:12:23.809 --> 04:12:23.819 align:start position:0%
I'm most comfortable having been in
 
04:12:26.570 --> 04:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
medicine for 40 years up in Dartmouth
 
04:12:28.969 --> 04:12:28.979 align:start position:0%
and through the New London area
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
as you all know ALS is also known as Lou
 
04:12:34.870 --> 04:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
Gehrig's Disease it's a really a fatal
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
devastating neurodegenerative disease
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
which patients suffer deeply I have
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
given you a written testimony hopefully
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
I'll have it as well as Dr stormel's
 
04:12:46.969 --> 04:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
It generally strikes people in our age
 
04:12:49.729 --> 04:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
group 50 to 75 it is thought to be a
 
04:12:51.410 --> 04:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
disease which is genetically susceptible
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
and likely even triggered by
 
04:12:55.969 --> 04:12:55.979 align:start position:0%
environmental you know stimuli
 
04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
the average survival time from the time
 
04:13:02.689 --> 04:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
of diagnosis is about 3.3 to 5 years
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
currently there's absolutely no cure and
 
04:13:07.490 --> 04:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
there's really no understanding of its
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
true etiology
 
04:13:11.929 --> 04:13:11.939 align:start position:0%
establishing an ALS registry in New
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would help those caring for
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
these patients better understand the
 
04:13:17.870 --> 04:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
disease and help treating its rather
 
04:13:20.269 --> 04:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
rapidly Progressive symptoms
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
present with me is Dr Elijah stomal Dr
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
Elijah stoma is a board of neurologist
 
04:13:26.150 --> 04:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth Hitchcock who I've worked
 
04:13:29.090 --> 04:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
with for many years and out in works in
 
04:13:31.250 --> 04:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
the care of many of these ALS patients
 
04:13:33.410 --> 04:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with his laboratory and
 
04:13:35.150 --> 04:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
his team
 
04:13:38.090 --> 04:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
so you might ask why a registry
 
04:13:40.429 --> 04:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
how many people have ALS
 
04:13:42.530 --> 04:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
is there a genetic predict
 
04:13:44.030 --> 04:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
these are straightforward questions we
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
know this from most diseases we take
 
04:13:49.309 --> 04:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
care of but we don't know it with ALS
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
without Registries and research these
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
questions just go unanswered
 
04:13:56.450 --> 04:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
it the Registries will help us
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
understand both the prevalence which is
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
the total burden in the state or region
 
04:14:03.290 --> 04:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
in the incidence how many cases per year
 
04:14:05.689 --> 04:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
are actually discovered
 
04:14:08.689 --> 04:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
they the Registries help us with um uh
 
04:14:10.010 --> 04:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
the Natural History genetic
 
04:14:12.889 --> 04:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
predispositions environmental influences
 
04:14:15.170 --> 04:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
the benefit of clinical tries and More
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire alone we have
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 to 40 new patients of
 
04:14:22.849 --> 04:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
ALS every year
 
04:14:26.330 --> 04:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
but that also is is recognizing that in
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
the northern part of New England about
 
04:14:30.290 --> 04:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
20 percent of these patients or patients
 
04:14:32.450 --> 04:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
with ALS go on undiagnosed and
 
04:14:32.460 --> 04:14:35.150 align:start position:0%
with ALS go on undiagnosed and
unrecognized

04:14:35.150 --> 04:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
unrecognized
 
04:14:37.130 --> 04:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
the Registries help providers give more
 
04:14:38.750 --> 04:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
accurate advice to patients and families
 
04:14:40.729 --> 04:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
for clinical pathways which can lead to
 
04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
improved care and life expectancies
 
04:14:45.889 --> 04:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
even in the absence of a cure which we
 
04:14:47.150 --> 04:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
don't have right now
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
Registries can also help get patients
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
connected with ALS support systems
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
and help them navigate really as we
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
would all recognize a very scary
 
04:14:58.969 --> 04:14:58.979 align:start position:0%
and sometimes very complicated Health
 
04:15:01.250 --> 04:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
Care system
 
04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
we have many Registries in medicine we
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
have them in cancer and infectious
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
disease many of you may have been
 
04:15:09.229 --> 04:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
involved or have family members who have
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
been involved in actually benefited from
 
04:15:12.349 --> 04:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
a registry
 
04:15:14.210 --> 04:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
with the registry
 
04:15:16.490 --> 04:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
um we get better treatment of diseases
 
04:15:18.410 --> 04:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
at once were considered basically death
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
sentences but with research Registries
 
04:15:23.150 --> 04:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
and identification of the problem a
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
living long and productive lives
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
the other the other part of this like
 
04:15:30.349 --> 04:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
many other
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
um diseases that we discover and that we
 
04:15:36.050 --> 04:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
treat and understand the etiology the
 
04:15:38.269 --> 04:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
derivative basic help here with would
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
help us with other neurodegenerative
 
04:15:42.889 --> 04:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
diseases think Alzheimer's disease and
 
04:15:45.110 --> 04:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
Parkinson's disease
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is really the only state
 
04:15:49.849 --> 04:15:49.859 align:start position:0%
in the country right now with a
 
04:15:52.370 --> 04:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
reportable mandated uh registry which is
 
04:15:54.830 --> 04:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
up and running curiously Vermont and
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
Maine our neighbors now we're surrounded
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
have just passed legislation to set up
 
04:16:01.729 --> 04:16:01.739 align:start position:0%
ALS ALS registries
 
04:16:03.530 --> 04:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
together with our neighboring states we
 
04:16:05.450 --> 04:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
will better able understand the regional
 
04:16:07.370 --> 04:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
burden of this disease and work
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
collaboratively and working the best
 
04:16:11.689 --> 04:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
possible care for our patients with ALS
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
Regional integration supported by a
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
registry helps us get a much broader
 
04:16:18.410 --> 04:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
data set
 
04:16:21.110 --> 04:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
diseases that we don't understand are
 
04:16:23.689 --> 04:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
benefited by getting large data sets the
 
04:16:25.849 --> 04:16:25.859 align:start position:0%
more data points the better able we are
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
able to understand demographics risk
 
04:16:31.550 --> 04:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
factors exposures prevalence and that's
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
how we lead ourselves to identify causes
 
04:16:37.790 --> 04:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:40.010 --> 04:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
Dutch stomal already has a very well
 
04:16:40.020 --> 04:16:41.450 align:start position:0%
Dutch stomal already has a very well
established

04:16:41.450 --> 04:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
established
 
04:16:44.090 --> 04:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
um I should say he also has a very well
 
04:16:46.450 --> 04:16:46.460 align:start position:0%
established Department which he runs
 
04:16:49.130 --> 04:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's a very strong laboratory which
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
takes care of virtually all of the ALS
 
04:16:53.330 --> 04:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
patients in the state he has a team of
 
04:16:56.389 --> 04:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
nurses mid-level providers residents
 
04:16:59.150 --> 04:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
fellows interns all who help them along
 
04:17:02.150 --> 04:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
with grants that he uses to support his
 
04:17:03.410 --> 04:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
ALS work
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
with a registry they will be able to
 
04:17:07.849 --> 04:17:07.859 align:start position:0%
provide even better care and even you
 
04:17:09.950 --> 04:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
know understand our regional burden and
 
04:17:12.050 --> 04:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
then ultimately connect with the
 
04:17:13.849 --> 04:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
National Registry
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
if we can then partner in some way or
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
another with the state
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
collaborating then with the National
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
Registry we can which can then provide
 
04:17:24.349 --> 04:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
us with a you know which is oftentimes
 
04:17:27.410 --> 04:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
considered a very um potential
 
04:17:30.410 --> 04:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
consequence of established Registries uh
 
04:17:32.990 --> 04:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
the National Registry now in the in the
 
04:17:35.809 --> 04:17:35.819 align:start position:0%
United States uses a system called
 
04:17:39.650 --> 04:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
redcap which we will have access to the
 
04:17:41.809 --> 04:17:41.819 align:start position:0%
the physician in charge of the National
 
04:17:44.570 --> 04:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
Registry has worked with Dr stomel and
 
04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
has basically stated that we will have
 
04:17:49.610 --> 04:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
access to the Red Cap system uh which is
 
04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
a safe electronic storage base
 
04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and committee members I
 
04:17:58.969 --> 04:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
honestly believe that my focus is on the
 
04:18:01.130 --> 04:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
patient only that's what I've done for
 
04:18:03.410 --> 04:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
40 years I know that we can work
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
together in some way or another to
 
04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
establish an ALS registry which will
 
04:18:08.809 --> 04:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
only improve the care of our patients
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
help family and friends who suffer with
 
04:18:13.490 --> 04:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
this debilitating disease and fatal
 
04:18:13.500 --> 04:18:14.389 align:start position:0%
this debilitating disease and fatal
disease

04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
disease
 
04:18:16.250 --> 04:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
it is only with this research and
 
04:18:18.050 --> 04:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
Registries that we will actually be able
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
to improve the model of care and
 
04:18:23.450 --> 04:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
therefore I encourage you to support
 
04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:18:25.800 --> 04:18:26.570 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

04:18:26.570 --> 04:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:28.189 --> 04:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'm more than willing to take any
 
04:18:29.929 --> 04:18:29.939 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have I am really
 
04:18:33.110 --> 04:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
not the subject matter expert I did take
 
04:18:35.210 --> 04:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
care of many patients with ALS only when
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
they slipped fell and broke a bone or a
 
04:18:39.530 --> 04:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
hip but I really don't understand ALS
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
much beyond that
 
04:18:42.769 --> 04:18:42.779 align:start position:0%
um but I'm willing to answer any
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
questions you may have of me but also I
 
04:18:47.450 --> 04:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
have here Dr stomal Who is prepared to
 
04:18:48.889 --> 04:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
give a statement and answer any
 
04:18:52.969 --> 04:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:56.809 --> 04:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions for
 
04:18:58.670 --> 04:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
this gentleman
 
04:19:01.429 --> 04:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
yes Dr Nagel I mean representative Nagel
 
04:19:03.530 --> 04:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll get it done
 
04:19:03.540 --> 04:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll get it done
eventually

04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
04:19:09.670 --> 04:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr representative Dr Murphy
 
04:19:12.410 --> 04:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
I just I have two questions if I made
 
04:19:14.809 --> 04:19:14.819 align:start position:0%
the first one is um
 
04:19:17.809 --> 04:19:17.819 align:start position:0%
how does this replace what does this
 
04:19:19.610 --> 04:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
offer us at the National Registry does
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
not and maybe you're not the right
 
04:19:23.330 --> 04:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
person to answer I probably am not the
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
right person I think Dr stomach how do
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
we know about Dr stomo then and have his
 
04:19:28.729 --> 04:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
testimony well why would you like to
 
04:19:30.110 --> 04:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
speak to that because he will be able to
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
speak more um uh cogently about that do
 
04:19:34.969 --> 04:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
you want me to answer it now sure go
 
04:19:37.969 --> 04:19:37.979 align:start position:0%
ahead good so uh the National Registry
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
is not a reportable mandatory registry
 
04:19:43.370 --> 04:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
and they probably only get somewhere
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
like 60 percent of cases in the in the
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
entire U.S
 
04:19:51.710 --> 04:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
um and one of the major goals here is to
 
04:19:54.349 --> 04:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
try to assert in all the cases and even
 
04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
go through the data to make sure there
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
aren't false positives
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and in big States like Michigan or
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
California or Texas if you were able to
 
04:20:06.650 --> 04:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
get all the cases in a state like that
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
in one year you'd have an incredible
 
04:20:12.590 --> 04:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
database and if you could share it with
 
04:20:14.210 --> 04:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
the National Registry which they would
 
04:20:17.870 --> 04:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
like to do then uh
 
04:20:20.630 --> 04:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win situation because they
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't have the the reportable registry
 
04:20:26.290 --> 04:20:26.300 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary process
 
04:20:29.330 --> 04:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
and eventually I could see where the
 
04:20:31.070 --> 04:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
National Registry might become a
 
04:20:33.290 --> 04:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
reportable mandatory registry but it
 
04:20:35.809 --> 04:20:35.819 align:start position:0%
isn't at this time
 
04:20:38.570 --> 04:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
let me ask a follow-up no go ahead you
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
kind of asked my second question
 
04:20:43.610 --> 04:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
um I diagnosed probably one patient a
 
04:20:46.010 --> 04:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
year with ALS and it's you said the word
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
mandate what happens to me if I neglect
 
04:20:51.469 --> 04:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
full in my duty what happens to you if
 
04:20:55.370 --> 04:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
I'm neglectful in my duty to to I failed
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
don't even know this registry exists
 
04:20:59.929 --> 04:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
whatever what happens to me I
 
04:21:02.330 --> 04:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
just of most Physicians including
 
04:21:04.550 --> 04:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
yourself would be
 
04:21:06.349 --> 04:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
um to report I don't think they're
 
04:21:08.929 --> 04:21:08.939 align:start position:0%
they're going to take you to jail
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't think uh you would be find
 
04:21:13.870 --> 04:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
some huge amount of money
 
04:21:16.010 --> 04:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
it brings
 
04:21:18.170 --> 04:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
it to everybody who's in the clinical
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
world to their attention that it's
 
04:21:21.889 --> 04:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
something that they need to report the
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
same thing with Lyme disease or
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases certain cancers
 
04:21:31.610 --> 04:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
is sort of on your on your filing system
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
that you need to report it and
 
04:21:34.319 --> 04:21:34.969 align:start position:0%
that you need to report it and
um

04:21:34.969 --> 04:21:34.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:37.490 --> 04:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
if I may also I think that you know as
 
04:21:39.290 --> 04:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
you well know I think most Physicians
 
04:21:40.969 --> 04:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
you know when they see that you're
 
04:21:43.130 --> 04:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
mandated to report something whether
 
04:21:44.809 --> 04:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
it's Lyme disease or other communicable
 
04:21:47.809 --> 04:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
diseases we tend to do that in that in
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
our business so to speak
 
04:21:52.130 --> 04:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
um uh one of the potential you know
 
04:21:54.290 --> 04:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
consequences of not reporting which is
 
04:21:56.929 --> 04:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
when mandated by Statute is even
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
potentially reporting to Board of
 
04:22:00.290 --> 04:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
Medicine to say there has been some
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
egregious Behavior here and you know
 
04:22:06.670 --> 04:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
maybe a reprimand or at least some
 
04:22:09.290 --> 04:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
knowledge that they need to do it and
 
04:22:12.530 --> 04:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:15.110 --> 04:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative Merchant thank you
 
04:22:16.250 --> 04:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
and also thank you Doug Stonewall taking
 
04:22:20.809 --> 04:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
my question if we have if I understand
 
04:22:22.370 --> 04:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
this correctly
 
04:22:25.130 --> 04:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
redcap currently exists
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
but the challenge is we're not using it
 
04:22:29.450 --> 04:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
to its fullest extent
 
04:22:32.210 --> 04:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
could we simply just mandate
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
that they reported to Red Cap and not
 
04:22:37.010 --> 04:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
have to set up our own registry
 
04:22:37.020 --> 04:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
have to set up our own registry
uh

04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:22:40.490 --> 04:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
important to have
 
04:22:44.210 --> 04:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
some experts who can a certain cases and
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
review records and make sure that there
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
is a misdiagnosis you don't want to have
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of false positives in a database
 
04:22:51.840 --> 04:22:53.210 align:start position:0%
a lot of false positives in a database
follow

04:22:53.210 --> 04:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:22:55.330 --> 04:22:55.340 align:start position:0%
-up thank you Mr chair
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
in saying that
 
04:23:00.050 --> 04:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
once it goes into the Red Cap
 
04:23:02.330 --> 04:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
could there be another step which I see
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
you have been kind enough to volunteer
 
04:23:06.530 --> 04:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
at least just now
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
to review a lot of the documents could
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
at that point your staff or somebody
 
04:23:12.650 --> 04:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
from the medical center review the
 
04:23:14.689 --> 04:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
documentation to invalidate the
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis my concern is that
 
04:23:19.610 --> 04:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
this is kind of frankly State of New
 
04:23:22.610 --> 04:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being frugally who we are to
 
04:23:24.170 --> 04:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
get authorization for half a million
 
04:23:25.849 --> 04:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
dollars is going to be an uphill
 
04:23:28.370 --> 04:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
challenge so I'm trying to find a way to
 
04:23:29.689 --> 04:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
allow for
 
04:23:31.969 --> 04:23:31.979 align:start position:0%
the reporting to occur in an existing
 
04:23:34.130 --> 04:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
database and if we could do that and
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
still have your staff review it it may
 
04:23:38.570 --> 04:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
take care of some of the fiscal note
 
04:23:40.250 --> 04:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
attached to it with that that's what I'm
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get to Okay so okay so our lab
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
does have red cap and there probably is
 
04:23:48.050 --> 04:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
a way to funnel the information directly
 
04:23:50.210 --> 04:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
into my lab
 
04:23:52.630 --> 04:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
um but we need some kind of legislation
 
04:23:58.790 --> 04:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:01.070 --> 04:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
but that's you know it's only going to
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
be about 30 patients a year 30 plus and
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm reviewing records on 30 patients
 
04:24:11.210 --> 04:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
every other day sometimes
 
04:24:14.030 --> 04:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
so representative Leon thank you Mr
 
04:24:15.530 --> 04:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you doctor for being
 
04:24:18.110 --> 04:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
here would changing would amending this
 
04:24:21.530 --> 04:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
to Simply require reporting to Dartmouth
 
04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
and to allow Dartmouth to maintain this
 
04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
information be sufficient in order to
 
04:24:28.610 --> 04:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
achieve these goals
 
04:24:31.309 --> 04:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
it would be sufficient to me
 
04:24:34.490 --> 04:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:38.689 --> 04:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
good peripheral vision Mr chairman thank
 
04:24:41.279 --> 04:24:42.290 align:start position:0%
good peripheral vision Mr chairman thank
you

04:24:42.290 --> 04:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:24:42.300 --> 04:24:46.729 align:start position:0%
you
um

04:24:46.729 --> 04:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:46.739 --> 04:24:48.010 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:24:48.010 --> 04:24:48.020 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
would would rep man would specifying a
 
04:24:57.889 --> 04:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
is there a concern
 
04:25:00.250 --> 04:25:00.260 align:start position:0%
other than mine because I don't know
 
04:25:04.370 --> 04:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
these systems well if we specify either
 
04:25:06.769 --> 04:25:06.779 align:start position:0%
something like redcap or a particular
 
04:25:06.779 --> 04:25:08.410 align:start position:0%
something like redcap or a particular
program

04:25:08.410 --> 04:25:08.420 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
aren't we creating a real mess for
 
04:25:14.929 --> 04:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
ourselves if if the program for example
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
moves from Dartmouth to another
 
04:25:21.110 --> 04:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
institution or if uh one registry is
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
found to be less user friendly and
 
04:25:25.030 --> 04:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
another one is created
 
04:25:27.410 --> 04:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm asking you the question
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
about are you more comfortable with a
 
04:25:34.130 --> 04:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
generic or with a specific
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
I don't see where their there would be
 
04:25:43.550 --> 04:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
another Center in New Hampshire with
 
04:25:46.250 --> 04:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
such a small number of patients
 
04:25:46.260 --> 04:25:46.849 align:start position:0%
such a small number of patients
um

04:25:46.849 --> 04:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:49.149 --> 04:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't know where that would be
 
04:25:53.149 --> 04:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of ALS patients
 
04:25:54.830 --> 04:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire either come to
 
04:25:56.929 --> 04:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth or end up at Mass General
 
04:25:59.450 --> 04:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
Hospital especially the ones on the
 
04:25:59.460 --> 04:26:00.710 align:start position:0%
Hospital especially the ones on the
border

04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
border
 
04:26:00.720 --> 04:26:01.550 align:start position:0%
border
um

04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:01.560 --> 04:26:03.410 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:26:03.410 --> 04:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:07.250 --> 04:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
so I I don't foresee things changing any
 
04:26:09.170 --> 04:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
kind of drastic way
 
04:26:11.689 --> 04:26:11.699 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative Weber
 
04:26:14.269 --> 04:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
so that just raises a follow-up for me
 
04:26:17.750 --> 04:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
is what happens uh with New Hampshire
 
04:26:19.490 --> 04:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
patients who are treated in
 
04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts do they go in our registry
 
04:26:25.969 --> 04:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
they're the way that those patients
 
04:26:27.290 --> 04:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
would be captured is through their
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians who are still in
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:26:31.920 --> 04:26:33.790 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
yeah

04:26:33.790 --> 04:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
doctor we kind of I kind of preempted
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
you before you could give a statement do
 
04:26:40.670 --> 04:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
you still want to give that statement or
 
04:26:43.090 --> 04:26:43.100 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
04:26:46.550 --> 04:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
Murphy did a great job but um I could
 
04:26:48.410 --> 04:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
add a few things okay
 
04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
um just to give you some examples
 
04:26:54.050 --> 04:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
um I've been studying ALS for
 
04:26:58.670 --> 04:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
probably 25 years now and had Fairly
 
04:27:01.130 --> 04:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
good success with funding and we've had
 
04:27:04.189 --> 04:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of epidemiology studies done and
 
04:27:06.889 --> 04:27:06.899 align:start position:0%
we found clustering of ALS in Northern
 
04:27:10.030 --> 04:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
New England in many areas one of our
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
sort of claim claims to fame is that we
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
were able to find clusters around water
 
04:27:18.830 --> 04:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
bodies that had cyanobacterial blooms
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
and cyanotoxins are implicated nail s
 
04:27:24.649 --> 04:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
and they're animal models that have
 
04:27:26.450 --> 04:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
shown that and there are clinical trials
 
04:27:29.950 --> 04:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
going on where you can sort of
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
arrest that exposure
 
04:27:33.239 --> 04:27:34.309 align:start position:0%
arrest that exposure
um

04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:37.010 --> 04:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
we've seen conjugal couples many
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
conjugal couples in Northern New England
 
04:27:40.910 --> 04:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
so people who live in the same house or
 
04:27:43.370 --> 04:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
work in the same office who come down
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
with ALS at about the same time those
 
04:27:47.290 --> 04:27:47.300 align:start position:0%
are fascinating
 
04:27:50.349 --> 04:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
and we've been collecting
 
04:27:54.349 --> 04:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
samples from patients saliva blood urine
 
04:27:58.610 --> 04:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
Nails we found risk factors including
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
the cyanotoxins heavy metals like lead
 
04:28:03.010 --> 04:28:03.020 align:start position:0%
and Mercury
 
04:28:05.570 --> 04:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
eating fish that are high on the trophic
 
04:28:09.189 --> 04:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
scale seems to be a risk factor for ALS
 
04:28:11.450 --> 04:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
persistent organic pollutants like
 
04:28:14.750 --> 04:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
pfases and other chemicals that come
 
04:28:14.760 --> 04:28:16.510 align:start position:0%
pfases and other chemicals that come
from

04:28:16.510 --> 04:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
electricity technology
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
I.T technology have persistent organic
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
pollutants in them that have been linked
 
04:28:31.250 --> 04:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:34.729 --> 04:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
air pollution I work with a with a lady
 
04:28:37.130 --> 04:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
in a physician
 
04:28:40.910 --> 04:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
from Mexico City where there's terrible
 
04:28:42.769 --> 04:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
air pollution and she's finding evidence
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
of ALS there and teenagers when she
 
04:28:48.530 --> 04:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
looks at the neuropathology
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so there's probably these factors
 
04:28:53.929 --> 04:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
including genetic factors and
 
04:28:57.229 --> 04:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
environmental factors work together and
 
04:28:59.330 --> 04:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
as an analogy not everybody who smokes
 
04:29:01.729 --> 04:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
cigarettes gets lung cancer but if you
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
have the right exposures over the right
 
04:29:06.889 --> 04:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
period of time it can have a devastating
 
04:29:06.899 --> 04:29:08.510 align:start position:0%
period of time it can have a devastating
effect

04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:29:08.520 --> 04:29:09.469 align:start position:0%
effect
um

04:29:09.469 --> 04:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:09.479 --> 04:29:11.929 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:29:11.929 --> 04:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:13.729 --> 04:29:13.739 align:start position:0%
was it going to say the VA population
 
04:29:16.330 --> 04:29:16.340 align:start position:0%
has about a two-fold higher rate of ALS
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
than the general public and that's been
 
04:29:20.090 --> 04:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
demonstrated all the way back to World
 
04:29:22.790 --> 04:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
War II and there's a lag period between
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
when they're deployed and when they come
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
down with ALS it's about 10 years and
 
04:29:29.809 --> 04:29:29.819 align:start position:0%
then there are all these things that
 
04:29:32.750 --> 04:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
that veterans are exposed to over their
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
their deployment
 
04:29:37.510 --> 04:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
um including
 
04:29:40.689 --> 04:29:40.699 align:start position:0%
dioxins pesticides
 
04:29:43.689 --> 04:29:43.699 align:start position:0%
diesel exhaust jet exhaust
 
04:29:47.649 --> 04:29:47.659 align:start position:0%
guns that produce a lot of lead
 
04:29:50.210 --> 04:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of unanswered questions
 
04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
there and you can imagine if the big
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
States in this country were to have
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
Registries like like Vermont New
 
04:30:02.830 --> 04:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not New Hampshire Vermont
 
04:30:06.170 --> 04:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
Maine and Massachusetts then you really
 
04:30:08.330 --> 04:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
can make a huge impact on understanding
 
04:30:11.750 --> 04:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
the disease and one of the keys here is
 
04:30:14.090 --> 04:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
is that if there's some precedence for
 
04:30:17.389 --> 04:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
setting these these these
 
04:30:20.210 --> 04:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
Registries up you might be able to get
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
the large states involved and then reach
 
04:30:25.849 --> 04:30:25.859 align:start position:0%
a point where the National Registry can
 
04:30:25.859 --> 04:30:27.469 align:start position:0%
a point where the National Registry can
can

04:30:27.469 --> 04:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:30:30.110 --> 04:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
take care of all the data and share it
 
04:30:32.269 --> 04:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
with whoever needs it so I think
 
04:30:36.170 --> 04:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
precedence here is is very important
 
04:30:36.180 --> 04:30:37.189 align:start position:0%
precedence here is is very important
um

04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:40.250 --> 04:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the cost of a of a
 
04:30:41.929 --> 04:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
registry in New Hampshire is going to
 
04:30:44.689 --> 04:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
amount to very much I know there's some
 
04:30:47.570 --> 04:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
disagreement about that but if my lab
 
04:30:51.649 --> 04:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
and my helpers were to do the brunt work
 
04:30:55.250 --> 04:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
and and review records and make sure
 
04:30:57.889 --> 04:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
they're safe and sound and in electronic
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
records and shared with the National
 
04:30:59.880 --> 04:31:01.490 align:start position:0%
records and shared with the National
Registry

04:31:01.490 --> 04:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
Registry
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
um I think the cost should be minimum
 
04:31:09.410 --> 04:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
minimal and I have
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
Paul made his word who's one of the
 
04:31:13.969 --> 04:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
directors of the National Registry that
 
04:31:16.910 --> 04:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
he could probably find funds to help
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
um pay for the assimilation of data and
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
the storage of data
 
04:31:22.680 --> 04:31:24.050 align:start position:0%
the storage of data
uh

04:31:24.050 --> 04:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:31:25.729 --> 04:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
so I think those are the important
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:33.410 --> 04:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take the bull by the horns
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
and and really try to help these ALS
 
04:31:38.210 --> 04:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
patients it's horrible to see them dying
 
04:31:41.450 --> 04:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
off and and can't do anything for them
 
04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you excellent point uh
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
04:31:49.130 --> 04:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
um answering this question
 
04:31:51.300 --> 04:31:52.250 align:start position:0%
um answering this question
um

04:31:52.250 --> 04:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
you use the number 30 people is that is
 
04:31:58.189 --> 04:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
that the number of new cases per year
 
04:32:00.769 --> 04:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
correct yes so that's a pretty minimal
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
number I I imagine the cumulative
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
numbers quite a bit more but still low
 
04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
the incidence is about one to two per
 
04:32:11.870 --> 04:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand yep so you you said you
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
just finished saying um that you think
 
04:32:17.530 --> 04:32:17.540 align:start position:0%
the cost would be minimal but there's a
 
04:32:20.689 --> 04:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal note here that where the costs
 
04:32:22.849 --> 04:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
seem to be
 
04:32:25.010 --> 04:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
pretty significant especially given
 
04:32:27.530 --> 04:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
pretty low numbers like
 
04:32:27.540 --> 04:32:28.910 align:start position:0%
pretty low numbers like
um

04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
over two hundred thousand dollars a year
 
04:32:35.269 --> 04:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
for two positions
 
04:32:37.490 --> 04:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't see that that would
 
04:32:39.649 --> 04:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
be necessary and then it costs should we
 
04:32:41.090 --> 04:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
ignore I guess well my question is
 
04:32:42.830 --> 04:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
should we ignore this part of the bill
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
at this point when we first wrote up the
 
04:32:48.110 --> 04:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
bill we were using some of the
 
04:32:50.210 --> 04:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
neighboring states models going forward
 
04:32:52.490 --> 04:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
we didn't Vermont and Maine don't have
 
04:32:54.110 --> 04:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
an academic Medical Center like Dr
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
stomals that can be a repository for all
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
of the data so in order to do that we we
 
04:33:02.090 --> 04:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
basically were using the model where
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
they were having that model having
 
04:33:05.929 --> 04:33:05.939 align:start position:0%
spoken with Dr stormel in the robust
 
04:33:08.570 --> 04:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
nature of his laboratory that the bottom
 
04:33:10.849 --> 04:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
line is you know he will be the
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
repository for a lot of the data the
 
04:33:14.689 --> 04:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
data collection the interpretation and
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
then ultimately
 
04:33:18.890 --> 04:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
um sharing it nationally uh with other
 
04:33:18.900 --> 04:33:20.269 align:start position:0%
um sharing it nationally uh with other
states

04:33:20.269 --> 04:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
um so I think that we can actually kind
 
04:33:25.250 --> 04:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
of we will ultimately minimize any
 
04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
potential costs with a significant
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
enhancement and the other derivative
 
04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
benefit is oftentimes when you
 
04:33:34.609 --> 04:33:34.619 align:start position:0%
understand a disease process like ALS
 
04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
you also are understanding other
 
04:33:37.970 --> 04:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
diseases like Parkinson's and
 
04:33:40.670 --> 04:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease they are and I'm not
 
04:33:42.490 --> 04:33:42.500 align:start position:0%
a neurologist
 
04:33:45.650 --> 04:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
Dr stomal is and he can tell you that
 
04:33:48.349 --> 04:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
there are similarities in trying to
 
04:33:50.689 --> 04:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
understand one has oftentimes a
 
04:33:52.490 --> 04:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
derivative benefit of helping others
 
04:33:56.330 --> 04:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:58.131 --> 04:33:58.141 align:start position:0%
um yes follow-up
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um so so it sounds like
 
04:34:03.230 --> 04:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is not accurate because
 
04:34:06.349 --> 04:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
now the thinking is that this um
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
registry could actually be incorporated
 
04:34:12.410 --> 04:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
into the the Dartmouth program
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
um it would seem to me I don't really
 
04:34:17.269 --> 04:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
know how one does this but um that
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
the bill should be refined before we
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
vote on it so that um
 
04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
so that people will be actually voting
 
04:34:27.650 --> 04:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
on something that's accurate and also
 
04:34:30.170 --> 04:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit more um
 
04:34:32.990 --> 04:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah palatable after I was speaking with
 
04:34:34.490 --> 04:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
Dr stormel and after the bill was
 
04:34:34.500 --> 04:34:35.510 align:start position:0%
Dr stormel and after the bill was
originally

04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
originally
 
04:34:38.510 --> 04:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
um uh drafted uh we recognized that as
 
04:34:40.369 --> 04:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
well that the fiscal note probably is
 
04:34:42.410 --> 04:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
well beyond what is absolutely necessary
 
04:34:45.769 --> 04:34:45.779 align:start position:0%
Dr stomal Labs is already very robust
 
04:34:48.051 --> 04:34:48.061 align:start position:0%
um there is already mechanisms in place
 
04:34:51.170 --> 04:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
for you know privacy there is also the
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
need to assimilate all of the data
 
04:34:56.209 --> 04:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
combine it nationally and actually make
 
04:34:57.890 --> 04:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
an impact on a disease that's fairly
 
04:34:59.570 --> 04:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
devastating representative thank you
 
04:35:02.090 --> 04:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
possibly an amendment uh I don't know if
 
04:35:03.769 --> 04:35:03.779 align:start position:0%
you want to do that but that might be
 
04:35:05.330 --> 04:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
something to consider representative
 
04:35:05.340 --> 04:35:07.970 align:start position:0%
something to consider representative
Weber

04:35:07.970 --> 04:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.890 --> 04:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
well I'm wondering if the mechanism
 
04:35:13.609 --> 04:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
isn't already in the bill on would the
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
language on page 1 lines 23 to 30 be the
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which the commissioner
 
04:35:25.551 --> 04:35:25.561 align:start position:0%
could simply say
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to have somebody else do it
 
04:35:29.869 --> 04:35:29.879 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to provide an awful
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
lot of funding for it yeah honestly
 
04:35:34.670 --> 04:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
would that would that suffice at this
 
04:35:36.830 --> 04:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
point or you know thank you for that
 
04:35:38.209 --> 04:35:38.219 align:start position:0%
question I don't have the bill right in
 
04:35:40.689 --> 04:35:40.699 align:start position:0%
front of me but I understand the intent
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding when we drafted the
 
04:35:46.810 --> 04:35:46.820 align:start position:0%
bill was that much of this data would be
 
04:35:49.849 --> 04:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
deposited into and I I don't know the
 
04:35:51.051 --> 04:35:51.061 align:start position:0%
exact numbers but I don't want to put
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
words in dot just almost but I imagine
 
04:35:55.970 --> 04:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
he has 99 of all the patients with ALS
 
04:35:58.609 --> 04:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and we
 
04:36:00.609 --> 04:36:00.619 align:start position:0%
don't really need a very robust system
 
04:36:04.250 --> 04:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
my intent and I will work with others
 
04:36:07.730 --> 04:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
um in in our region right here with us
 
04:36:11.330 --> 04:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
to figure out how we get the data to Dr
 
04:36:13.490 --> 04:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
stormel's Laboratory
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
um and I think it will be at a minimal
 
04:36:17.810 --> 04:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
cost basically because he already has a
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
system up and running and could I have
 
04:36:21.769 --> 04:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
one follow-up Mr chair
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
follow-up and will you also be working
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
with the Department to satisfy the
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
department that the language is not
 
04:36:32.529 --> 04:36:32.539 align:start position:0%
putting on them the onus of a large
 
04:36:35.330 --> 04:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
structure that they're not prepared to
 
04:36:37.551 --> 04:36:37.561 align:start position:0%
deal with in the absence of a
 
04:36:39.289 --> 04:36:39.299 align:start position:0%
significant amount of funding and for
 
04:36:40.849 --> 04:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
which it doesn't sound like there's any
 
04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
need because there's already a structure
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
available right our conversations prior
 
04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
to presenting today with the Department
 
04:36:48.769 --> 04:36:48.779 align:start position:0%
was basically to have those
 
04:36:48.779 --> 04:36:51.051 align:start position:0%
was basically to have those
conversations

04:36:51.051 --> 04:36:51.061 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
04:36:54.529 --> 04:36:54.539 align:start position:0%
uh Dr representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
04:36:54.539 --> 04:36:55.849 align:start position:0%
uh Dr representative Nagel thank you Mr
chairman

04:36:55.849 --> 04:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:36:58.369 --> 04:36:58.379 align:start position:0%
um Dr stumble I've known of you for a
 
04:36:59.810 --> 04:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
very long time I think the work you're
 
04:37:01.609 --> 04:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
doing is absolutely wonderful and very
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
needed and I appreciate you doing that
 
04:37:06.650 --> 04:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
um I've been involved with universities
 
04:37:09.429 --> 04:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
a lot and I know people come and they go
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
continuity is extremely important with
 
04:37:15.170 --> 04:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
the registry and I'm curious what the
 
04:37:17.631 --> 04:37:17.641 align:start position:0%
plan would be for registry when you're
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
not there anymore and I don't know what
 
04:37:23.230 --> 04:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
your time frame is what's that sorry
 
04:37:26.090 --> 04:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
yeah so so um
 
04:37:29.150 --> 04:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
I think you know people come and go as
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
you said and uh
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
I feel deeply that that I would turn
 
04:37:37.570 --> 04:37:37.580 align:start position:0%
this over to somebody who is responsible
 
04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to have to take care of
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
the ALS patients when I'm gone and uh
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to continue to come in
 
04:37:49.789 --> 04:37:49.799 align:start position:0%
and uh it's if you have any interest in
 
04:37:49.799 --> 04:37:50.949 align:start position:0%
and uh it's if you have any interest in
research

04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
research
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
everything will be set up for you and um
 
04:37:57.769 --> 04:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's you're being held
 
04:38:01.131 --> 04:38:01.141 align:start position:0%
handed a golden uh platter and I would
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
also from retirement I would also add
 
04:38:05.330 --> 04:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
that you know I am no longer fixing
 
04:38:07.070 --> 04:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
bones anymore but I know there are
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
adequate you know uh there are excellent
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
people at Dartmouth still taking care of
 
04:38:13.131 --> 04:38:13.141 align:start position:0%
good taking care of Bones and that is
 
04:38:14.570 --> 04:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
basically the legacy of the church here
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
Medical Center bringing on people that
 
04:38:18.051 --> 04:38:18.061 align:start position:0%
can actually carry on the work that's
 
04:38:20.209 --> 04:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
already starting thank you any other
 
04:38:24.910 --> 04:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Dr
 
04:38:28.970 --> 04:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
stromo and Murphy
 
04:38:31.849 --> 04:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
so given everything that has been shared
 
04:38:34.369 --> 04:38:34.379 align:start position:0%
and the clarification that you would
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
house the registry
 
04:38:39.949 --> 04:38:39.959 align:start position:0%
and this clarification that mandatory
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
reporting to you would be sufficient I
 
04:38:45.170 --> 04:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
am wondering
 
04:38:48.769 --> 04:38:48.779 align:start position:0%
would that then also mean you would be
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
reporting to the National Registry or
 
04:38:57.529 --> 04:38:57.539 align:start position:0%
um you need that uh sort of clarified as
 
04:38:59.330 --> 04:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
an expectation and could you be
 
04:39:01.730 --> 04:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
designated as the
 
04:39:03.709 --> 04:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
given the prior conversation could you
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
be designated as the the state
 
04:39:08.990 --> 04:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
registry not naming Dartmouth but the
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
State academic ALS registry
 
04:39:14.570 --> 04:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly what you'd call it
 
04:39:17.330 --> 04:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:39:19.970 --> 04:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
there's a ALS Center of Excellence at
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth which is part of the ALS
 
04:39:22.920 --> 04:39:24.230 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth which is part of the ALS
Association

04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
Association
 
04:39:27.289 --> 04:39:27.299 align:start position:0%
so um we could come up with a title and
 
04:39:29.769 --> 04:39:29.779 align:start position:0%
and contact people including myself
 
04:39:32.330 --> 04:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
that could and you would do the
 
04:39:34.010 --> 04:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
reporting as part of that or does that
 
04:39:36.650 --> 04:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
need to be authorized to the FED to this
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
National Registry we would have a
 
04:39:43.250 --> 04:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
easy system by which to transfer data
 
04:39:43.260 --> 04:39:44.868 align:start position:0%
easy system by which to transfer data
from

04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:39:47.930 --> 04:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
the registry at Dartmouth Hitchcock to
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
how's that representative thank you okay
 
04:39:55.810 --> 04:39:55.820 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
04:39:57.958 --> 04:39:59.750 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
so

04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm clear all right are you
 
04:40:06.470 --> 04:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
supporting then that the commissioner
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
would be the one to hold the
 
04:40:11.570 --> 04:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility but the commission would
 
04:40:13.810 --> 04:40:13.820 align:start position:0%
therefore work with Dartmouth Health
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
disestablished registry and so forth so
 
04:40:18.110 --> 04:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
if you look at where it says here in the
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
establishment the commissioner of the
 
04:40:20.690 --> 04:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:40:23.690 --> 04:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
shall established are you proposing then
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
the commission of the Department of
 
04:40:26.330 --> 04:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services shall work
 
04:40:28.250 --> 04:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
with Dartmouth Health to establish and
 
04:40:28.260 --> 04:40:29.448 align:start position:0%
with Dartmouth Health to establish and
create

04:40:29.448 --> 04:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
create
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
is that the intent are you talking about
 
04:40:33.230 --> 04:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
just Dr sumo
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
well I don't think that there would be
 
04:40:37.970 --> 04:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
really a need for a commissioner to
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
review data I think it could go directly
 
04:40:43.430 --> 04:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
to the ALS Center
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
yeah right
 
04:40:45.240 --> 04:40:46.310 align:start position:0%
yeah right
okay

04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:50.150 --> 04:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
I think we're good thank you very much
 
04:40:53.050 --> 04:40:53.060 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:58.990 --> 04:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
so rather than
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
establish could it be designate
 
04:41:04.490 --> 04:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
as far as the language
 
04:41:06.410 --> 04:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
because we have cancer Registries at
 
04:41:07.850 --> 04:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth that are the official state
 
04:41:11.090 --> 04:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
cancer registry so akin to that you
 
04:41:12.590 --> 04:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
already have the registry it's just not
 
04:41:14.810 --> 04:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
the official state one
 
04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
that might be taken up in a work session
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
or during the amendment process
 
04:41:22.128 --> 04:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you had a comment
 
04:41:22.138 --> 04:41:23.810 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you had a comment
okay

04:41:23.810 --> 04:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:41:26.930 --> 04:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions uh I'm seeing
 
04:41:28.970 --> 04:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much gentlemen thank
 
04:41:28.980 --> 04:41:32.810 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much gentlemen thank
you

04:41:32.810 --> 04:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:36.170 --> 04:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
next up is uh and let me take my glasses
 
04:41:37.330 --> 04:41:37.340 align:start position:0%
off for this one
 
04:41:48.770 --> 04:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:50.990 --> 04:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like I could use a handwriting
 
04:41:53.208 --> 04:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
lesson though for you no it's just it's
 
04:41:54.368 --> 04:41:54.378 align:start position:0%
my vision
 
04:41:56.810 --> 04:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm Jerry Stringham
 
04:41:58.788 --> 04:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
I'm the representative from Lincoln and
 
04:42:03.368 --> 04:42:03.378 align:start position:0%
Woodstock I'm a member of Finance three
 
04:42:06.530 --> 04:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
outside of of the state house I am a
 
04:42:09.610 --> 04:42:09.620 align:start position:0%
consultant in the healthcare industry
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
mainly working on reimbursement for
 
04:42:14.570 --> 04:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
medical technology which among other
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
things has me authoring studies using
 
04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
longitudinal data from claims data or
 
04:42:21.958 --> 04:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
longitudinal data from claims data or
registries

04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
registries
 
04:42:25.610 --> 04:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm I'm here really I think we
 
04:42:27.650 --> 04:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
heard most of what we had to hear about
 
04:42:31.010 --> 04:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
the bill itself but I'm here uh to talk
 
04:42:35.390 --> 04:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
about my personal experience with ALS my
 
04:42:38.570 --> 04:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law Dane Ward was a wonderful
 
04:42:42.170 --> 04:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
spouse to my sister uh Jenny he was an
 
04:42:46.070 --> 04:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
intelligent healthy and kind soul he was
 
04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
in his late 50s
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
and was a runner and in perfect shape
 
04:42:53.810 --> 04:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
great health his whole life at his
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
eldest son's wedding it was the first
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
time we noticed that his leg wasn't
 
04:43:03.170 --> 04:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
raising right and he uh he tripped a
 
04:43:05.868 --> 04:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
couple of times three months later he
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
was a full boar diagnosed with ALS in
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
one year one and a half years later he
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
passed away having gone through the
 
04:43:17.448 --> 04:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
incredible typical ALS devastating
 
04:43:17.458 --> 04:43:19.490 align:start position:0%
incredible typical ALS devastating
decline

04:43:19.490 --> 04:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
decline
 
04:43:19.500 --> 04:43:20.530 align:start position:0%
decline
um

04:43:20.530 --> 04:43:20.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:24.050 --> 04:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
this bill is important and was asked for
 
04:43:27.288 --> 04:43:27.298 align:start position:0%
by members of the ALS Community I know
 
04:43:30.430 --> 04:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
because there are many research areas
 
04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
still unstudied that could help these
 
04:43:36.590 --> 04:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
people my brother-in-law Dean was a PhD
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
and he was selected to be part of an ALS
 
04:43:42.890 --> 04:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
study group that kept a prioritized list
 
04:43:45.948 --> 04:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
of over 500 different identified
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
projects that that they could
 
04:43:52.788 --> 04:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
potentially benefit from and he after
 
04:43:54.770 --> 04:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
reading through the list one day said
 
04:43:56.330 --> 04:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
just for the heck of it he went to the
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
lowest priority project on there and he
 
04:44:00.250 --> 04:44:00.260 align:start position:0%
thought it was actually pretty good
 
04:44:03.230 --> 04:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of unexplored
 
04:44:03.240 --> 04:44:04.868 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of unexplored
opportunity

04:44:04.868 --> 04:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
and leveraging from the history of
 
04:44:10.490 --> 04:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
others that can happen through registry
 
04:44:12.190 --> 04:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
is really important
 
04:44:14.690 --> 04:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
cures and better treatment can come from
 
04:44:17.690 --> 04:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
these types of observational studies
 
04:44:21.530 --> 04:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
that come out of these and um uh you
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
know um I
 
04:44:23.280 --> 04:44:24.170 align:start position:0%
know um I
um

04:44:24.170 --> 04:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:27.288 --> 04:44:27.298 align:start position:0%
I think that this type of registry can
 
04:44:30.050 --> 04:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
help people like Dane and uh I hope
 
04:44:31.970 --> 04:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
there's a way we can we can establish it
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
um and I do know this this group has
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
been incredibly uh effective at raising
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
money through things like the ice Buck
 
04:44:45.410 --> 04:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
bucket challenge uh and um
 
04:44:49.128 --> 04:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm sure there'll be it'll be
 
04:44:50.990 --> 04:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
leveraged to the fullest if it exists
 
04:44:53.628 --> 04:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm also very grateful for Dr Steve
 
04:44:56.350 --> 04:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
oh for all he did there was a Dr Stegall
 
04:44:59.930 --> 04:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
supporting my brother-in-law that uh uh
 
04:45:02.810 --> 04:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
we were grateful for every day so thank
 
04:45:04.910 --> 04:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you any are you taking
 
04:45:08.208 --> 04:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:11.930 --> 04:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
in the last pink card certainly not last
 
04:45:16.128 --> 04:45:16.138 align:start position:0%
but not least we um have our friend

model of problem solving and I have to
 
04:45:54.770 --> 04:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank represent Jim Murphy James Murphy
 
04:45:56.448 --> 04:45:56.458 align:start position:0%
for taking the time to hear the
 
04:45:59.150 --> 04:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
Department's concerns I would um want to
 
04:46:01.368 --> 04:46:01.378 align:start position:0%
make one clarification the fiscal
 
04:46:03.050 --> 04:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
analysis that was done by the
 
04:46:04.610 --> 04:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
Legislative budget Assistance Office
 
04:46:06.410 --> 04:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
based upon information thoughtful
 
04:46:07.730 --> 04:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
information supplied by the department
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
is accurately reflected based upon the
 
04:46:12.110 --> 04:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
four corners of the document and the
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
bill that's in front of you the bill
 
04:46:16.128 --> 04:46:16.138 align:start position:0%
that's in front of you does mandate that
 
04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
the department set up a registry I
 
04:46:20.030 --> 04:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
registry that you've heard now
 
04:46:23.350 --> 04:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
testifying that the academic medical
 
04:46:26.570 --> 04:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
folks are able to do and this is a
 
04:46:28.190 --> 04:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
really good example because this bill
 
04:46:29.868 --> 04:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
actually came before this committee and
 
04:46:32.330 --> 04:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
for those of you who were here in 2019
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
there was HB 644 a very thoughtful Bill
 
04:46:38.448 --> 04:46:38.458 align:start position:0%
pretty much similar testimony Dr stomal
 
04:46:40.610 --> 04:46:40.620 align:start position:0%
came and testified to the committee as
 
04:46:42.470 --> 04:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
well but it didn't go forward because it
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have a funding mechanism for the
 
04:46:45.890 --> 04:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
Department to move forward with the bill
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
we do think and I have to say that very
 
04:46:49.610 --> 04:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
insightful questions I would say at
 
04:46:51.230 --> 04:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
least four or five great questions from
 
04:46:52.850 --> 04:46:52.860 align:start position:0%
this side of the room not to ignore
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
folks over here but but Bill's sponsor
 
04:46:56.570 --> 04:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
Bill sponsor is over here and he was
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
testifying but also from the front of
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
the room with your leadership you
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
actually came up with a solution that we
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
were talking with out in the hallway
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
with with Doctor uh excuse me
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Robert
 
04:47:09.470 --> 04:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
um representative Murphy
 
04:47:11.570 --> 04:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
um on this bill and so we think we can
 
04:47:14.030 --> 04:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
work out a solution to this um key to
 
04:47:15.890 --> 04:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
this bill is the mandated reporting
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that can be taken out of the
 
04:47:19.368 --> 04:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
department statutes and rather put in
 
04:47:21.410 --> 04:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
the physician surgeon statutes so that
 
04:47:23.330 --> 04:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
it would show that those individuals
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
would have a reporting requirement we
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to see people go to the jail
 
04:47:28.430 --> 04:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
or anything like that we want it to be a
 
04:47:29.868 --> 04:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
positive collaborative environment but
 
04:47:31.310 --> 04:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require the Department's
 
04:47:34.070 --> 04:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
oversight hhs's oversight or involvement
 
04:47:36.288 --> 04:47:36.298 align:start position:0%
I would also suggest and this is one of
 
04:47:37.850 --> 04:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
those rare occasions because I think
 
04:47:39.470 --> 04:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
that representative Weber is one of the
 
04:47:41.330 --> 04:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
finest drafters of legislation but this
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
is one of those rare occasions where
 
04:47:45.050 --> 04:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
identifying a specific entity is really
 
04:47:46.670 --> 04:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
critically important because they're the
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
one entity that could do that here in
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that could be accomplished
 
04:47:52.250 --> 04:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
through a chapter law versus putting it
 
04:47:54.770 --> 04:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
into an RSA so with those changes we are
 
04:47:57.110 --> 04:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
here as a resource to represent Murphy
 
04:47:58.850 --> 04:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
the committee and we think we can come
 
04:48:00.230 --> 04:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
up with a solution that we didn't come
 
04:48:02.090 --> 04:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
up with back in 2019 I know
 
04:48:04.128 --> 04:48:04.138 align:start position:0%
representative shame on well at least
 
04:48:06.288 --> 04:48:06.298 align:start position:0%
one person testifying right now but I do
 
04:48:08.448 --> 04:48:08.458 align:start position:0%
think we have a solution to eliminating
 
04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact of the bill by taking
 
04:48:12.650 --> 04:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
the department completely out of the
 
04:48:14.570 --> 04:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
conversation in terms of at least the
 
04:48:16.850 --> 04:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
program now with that said we like
 
04:48:18.410 --> 04:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth find that information to be
 
04:48:20.810 --> 04:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
critically important critically valuable
 
04:48:22.490 --> 04:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
and that's why I have the wonderful Miss
 
04:48:23.930 --> 04:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
Royce next to me who's going to tell you
 
04:48:25.970 --> 04:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
about the merits of the importance of
 
04:48:27.470 --> 04:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
that information anything else you'd
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
like to testify to and remaining one
 
04:48:32.930 --> 04:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Murphy and Dr
 
04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
stromwell did a really nice job of
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
giving an overview of ALS and you know
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
under the way this bill is written such
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
to what John just said in addition to
 
04:48:46.368 --> 04:48:46.378 align:start position:0%
the registry if if that's being moved
 
04:48:47.810 --> 04:48:47.820 align:start position:0%
out from under the department there is
 
04:48:49.550 --> 04:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
other language in here around the
 
04:48:51.288 --> 04:48:51.298 align:start position:0%
development and design of educational
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
materials and Outreach materials
 
04:48:55.128 --> 04:48:55.138 align:start position:0%
so I would just share that that would
 
04:48:56.750 --> 04:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
need to be something that is discussed
 
04:48:58.730 --> 04:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
as well because currently in public
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
health there there is no program or
 
04:49:03.410 --> 04:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
resources or funding or staff focused on
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
ALS right now so that would be something
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
new and then to also just share
 
04:49:13.010 --> 04:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
um RSA 141b and 141c do not include ALS
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
as a reportable as a reportable disease
 
04:49:17.930 --> 04:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
and currently we do not have the
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
authority under us to mandate something
 
04:49:22.670 --> 04:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
like this to be reported
 
04:49:24.708 --> 04:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
and that'll just quickly share as you
 
04:49:26.750 --> 04:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
know we think about Als in the the
 
04:49:28.788 --> 04:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
incidents and the prevalence
 
04:49:30.170 --> 04:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
um those are estimates that were
 
04:49:31.490 --> 04:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
provided and when we look at the
 
04:49:33.470 --> 04:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
National Data we know that the
 
04:49:36.170 --> 04:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
prevalence of this is around 5.5 per 100
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
000 people and then incidents so new
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
cases around 1.5 cases per hundred
 
04:49:44.690 --> 04:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
thousand so every life is important you
 
04:49:46.550 --> 04:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
know the fiscal impact here would be
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
pretty severe for the department and so
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see that there are some
 
04:49:52.970 --> 04:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
options on the table
 
04:49:57.948 --> 04:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry representative King
 
04:50:04.190 --> 04:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I didn't catch the rsas that you
 
04:50:10.610 --> 04:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh I heard 141 141b and 141c
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you repeat the last one
 
04:50:12.120 --> 04:50:15.050 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you repeat the last one
DNC

04:50:15.050 --> 04:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
DNC
 
04:50:17.570 --> 04:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very simple
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
I believe we also sent written testimony
 
04:50:22.610 --> 04:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
to the committee as well and that is
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
those are in there as well
 
04:50:30.650 --> 04:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:33.288 --> 04:50:33.298 align:start position:0%
so just as a drafting guideline we would
 
04:50:35.890 --> 04:50:35.900 align:start position:0%
need to change those statutes as well to
 
04:50:39.288 --> 04:50:39.298 align:start position:0%
include this as a mandated recording or
 
04:50:40.850 --> 04:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
are you saying we
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
leave it out of there and just put it
 
04:50:48.410 --> 04:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
I work with office of professional
 
04:50:51.770 --> 04:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
licensure then that would be something
 
04:50:53.930 --> 04:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
different to mandate Physicians to
 
04:50:56.090 --> 04:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
report this so we would not need to
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
revise 141 B or C okay thank you
 
04:51:02.208 --> 04:51:02.218 align:start position:0%
Department yes and the critical statute
 
04:51:05.150 --> 04:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
to references under chapter 329
 
04:51:06.890 --> 04:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
physician surgeon statute we think that
 
04:51:09.050 --> 04:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
that at least preliminarily with a
 
04:51:10.670 --> 04:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
needed conversation to our friends at
 
04:51:12.110 --> 04:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
04:51:13.850 --> 04:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
certification who we love and adore hi
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh to the viewing audience and so we do
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
need to make sure they're included in
 
04:51:20.090 --> 04:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
that conversation under that chapter for
 
04:51:22.670 --> 04:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirement
 
04:51:26.390 --> 04:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:28.368 --> 04:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
04:51:28.378 --> 04:51:30.288 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

04:51:30.288 --> 04:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:51:32.330 --> 04:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
okay I know of no one else ahead of
 
04:51:34.250 --> 04:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
testifier on this bill
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to is anyone else does
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to do so
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I am going to close the
 
04:51:43.850 --> 04:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 329 and open the
 
04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%

I'm the sponsor of HB 614 a bill that
 
04:52:38.510 --> 04:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
when filed proposed creating a pfas

repository to collect adverse Health
 
04:52:43.730 --> 04:52:43.740 align:start position:0%

this initiative was one of those
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
recommended for legislation and included
 
04:52:57.890 --> 04:52:57.900 align:start position:0%

04:53:12.650 --> 04:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
to an increase of excess cases of
 
04:53:15.288 --> 04:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
identified kidney cancer in Merrimack
 
04:53:17.868 --> 04:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
through this reporting DHHS made a
 
04:53:19.970 --> 04:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
recommendation that in response to the
 
04:53:22.250 --> 04:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
increase in cases the next appropriate
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
steps would be to conduct a phase 3
 
04:53:26.208 --> 04:53:26.218 align:start position:0%
feasibility study
 
04:53:28.368 --> 04:53:28.378 align:start position:0%
this feasibility study was another of
 
04:53:31.390 --> 04:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
the recommendations in the hb7 HB
 
04:53:34.250 --> 04:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
737pfest commission annual report
 
04:53:35.930 --> 04:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
as it is germane and with your
 
04:53:37.490 --> 04:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
permission I would like to introduce a
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
replace all amendment to hb614 that
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
would include language and an
 
04:53:44.570 --> 04:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the Department of
 
04:53:46.250 --> 04:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to engage in
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
this next step it is important work that
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
has potential to benefit communities
 
04:53:53.270 --> 04:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
Beyond Merrimack feasibility study
 
04:53:55.550 --> 04:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
relative to kidney cancers in this pfas
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
contaminated Community as proposed in
 
04:53:59.690 --> 04:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
this amendment is essentially
 
04:54:01.250 --> 04:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
foundational work for the data
 
04:54:02.810 --> 04:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
collection sought for our health
 
04:54:04.970 --> 04:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
outcomes Repository
 
04:54:08.030 --> 04:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
and can identify appropriate Cancers and
 
04:54:10.190 --> 04:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
health outcomes for inclusion in a
 
04:54:12.770 --> 04:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
potential epidemiological study
 
04:54:14.690 --> 04:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
with your permission I have copies that
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment has been brought forward
 
04:55:01.730 --> 04:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
after a significant collaboration with
 
04:55:01.740 --> 04:55:04.070 align:start position:0%
after a significant collaboration with
DHHS

04:55:04.070 --> 04:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
DHHS
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
um and I want to explain a little bit
 
04:55:07.550 --> 04:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
about why I've come home with this
 
04:55:07.560 --> 04:55:09.110 align:start position:0%
about why I've come home with this
amendment

04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:55:11.448 --> 04:55:11.458 align:start position:0%
given the statistically significant
 
04:55:13.490 --> 04:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
excess in the number of cases of kidney
 
04:55:16.250 --> 04:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
cancer in Merrimack the known exposure
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
of this community to environmental
 
04:55:20.090 --> 04:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
contaminants like pfas that have been
 
04:55:22.670 --> 04:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
associated with kidney cancer
 
04:55:24.288 --> 04:55:24.298 align:start position:0%
an increase in the number of those
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
cancer diagnoses over time
 
04:55:28.368 --> 04:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
and the recommendation of New
 
04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's DHHS that a feasibility
 
04:55:32.570 --> 04:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
study as determined by the New Hampshire
 
04:55:34.610 --> 04:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
cancer concern investigation protocol
 
04:55:37.368 --> 04:55:37.378 align:start position:0%
phase three be conducted to further
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
investigate this very concerning
 
04:55:41.330 --> 04:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
negative Health outcome
 
04:55:45.170 --> 04:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
HB 614 is amended is meant to authorize
 
04:55:47.570 --> 04:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
an appropriation to fund this cancer
 
04:55:50.330 --> 04:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
investigation protocol as despite its
 
04:55:52.850 --> 04:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
many wonderful employees DHHS does not
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
have the expertise in-house nor
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
resources to complete the study itself
 
04:56:00.050 --> 04:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
this work would be done through a
 
04:56:02.208 --> 04:56:02.218 align:start position:0%
contract with an academic or research
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
organization and would inform the next
 
04:56:07.128 --> 04:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
steps in the investigation
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
feasibility study would identify
 
04:56:11.570 --> 04:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate Cancers and health outcomes
 
04:56:13.690 --> 04:56:13.700 align:start position:0%
to be included in a phase four
 
04:56:15.708 --> 04:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
epidemiological study if that is
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
determined to be warranted as well as
 
04:56:19.970 --> 04:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
any next steps
 
04:56:23.868 --> 04:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
additionally hb614 would allow DHHS to
 
04:56:26.270 --> 04:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
identify potential exposures that may
 
04:56:27.890 --> 04:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
contribute to this excess of kidney
 
04:56:30.110 --> 04:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
cancer incidents and Aid in
 
04:56:30.120 --> 04:56:31.310 align:start position:0%
cancer incidents and Aid in
understanding

04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:56:33.288 --> 04:56:33.298 align:start position:0%
how those exposures May contribute to
 
04:56:35.208 --> 04:56:35.218 align:start position:0%
the excess of kidney cancer incidents in
 
04:56:35.218 --> 04:56:38.330 align:start position:0%
the excess of kidney cancer incidents in
Merrimack

04:56:38.330 --> 04:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:41.030 --> 04:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you all know probably what a
 
04:56:43.128 --> 04:56:43.138 align:start position:0%
feasibility study is I did not know
 
04:56:43.138 --> 04:56:44.230 align:start position:0%
feasibility study is I did not know
myself

04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:56:49.490 --> 04:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
and in terms of HB 614 it's part of the
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
cancer investigation protocol the
 
04:56:53.690 --> 04:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
purpose of which is to gather more
 
04:56:55.788 --> 04:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
information to see if it's likely that a
 
04:56:57.530 --> 04:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
study will show whether or not the
 
04:56:59.090 --> 04:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
cancer cases that we see here in
 
04:56:59.100 --> 04:57:00.110 align:start position:0%
cancer cases that we see here in
Merrimack

04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
Merrimack
 
04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
relate to a common cause for example the
 
04:57:05.390 --> 04:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
long-term exposure Merrimack residents
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
have had to the pfest contamination of
 
04:57:09.948 --> 04:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
our air water and soil
 
04:57:12.650 --> 04:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
there are a number of steps in regards
 
04:57:16.010 --> 04:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
to the study that um DC excuse me DHHS
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
could certainly elaborate on and they're
 
04:57:20.448 --> 04:57:20.458 align:start position:0%
here and I know willing to to take
 
04:57:20.458 --> 04:57:22.128 align:start position:0%
here and I know willing to to take
questions

04:57:22.128 --> 04:57:22.138 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:57:25.510 --> 04:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
um why we need this study you know it's
 
04:57:29.930 --> 04:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
a full epidemiological study is is time
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
and resource intensive I mean it's an
 
04:57:34.970 --> 04:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
important important to determine whether
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
or not that level of study is warranted
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
um the feasibility study would also
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
identify appropriate Cancers and health
 
04:57:43.970 --> 04:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
outcomes for their inclusion in the
 
04:57:45.890 --> 04:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
study I know when we looked at the
 
04:57:47.750 --> 04:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
Cancer report that we received in 2018
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
there were a number of other cancers I
 
04:57:51.470 --> 04:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
think at least three or four that were
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
just below that level where they um uh
 
04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
they reached the sir number and so you
 
04:58:00.350 --> 04:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
know we were talking kidney cancer is
 
04:58:02.750 --> 04:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
certainly an excess but in the Merrimack
 
04:58:04.490 --> 04:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
Community has concerns about a number of
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
other of cancers and health impacts as
 
04:58:06.958 --> 04:58:08.270 align:start position:0%
other of cancers and health impacts as
well

04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:58:10.850 --> 04:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
this study will tell us
 
04:58:12.410 --> 04:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
um it could help determine the
 
04:58:14.448 --> 04:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
plausibility that cases and contaminants
 
04:58:16.750 --> 04:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
have the potential to be Associated
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
and it would help us identify those
 
04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
cancers I mean other health outcomes for
 
04:58:28.850 --> 04:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
inclusion in that in a future study
 
04:58:31.788 --> 04:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
the benefits to impacted citizens we
 
04:58:33.530 --> 04:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
would finally have the data that we
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
believe exists but we just don't have it
 
04:58:38.390 --> 04:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
collected anywhere that shows our cancer
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
cases may be related to a common cause
 
04:58:43.250 --> 04:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
and that may impact things such as
 
04:58:46.670 --> 04:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring and also the more we
 
04:58:46.680 --> 04:58:48.010 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring and also the more we
know

04:58:48.010 --> 04:58:48.020 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:58:50.330 --> 04:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
our decision making is based on
 
04:58:50.340 --> 04:58:51.410 align:start position:0%
our decision making is based on
information

04:58:51.410 --> 04:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
so um this is you know it's a bit of
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
information that we don't have
 
04:58:58.970 --> 04:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
um the this will provide us a better
 
04:59:00.288 --> 04:59:00.298 align:start position:0%
understanding of the strengths and
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
limitations of existing Public Health
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
surveillance tools to support this work
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
I know we had originally talked about a
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
registry and then a repository of this
 
04:59:09.430 --> 04:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
health information
 
04:59:13.730 --> 04:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
but part of the the challenge is making
 
04:59:15.410 --> 04:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
sure that we have the tools to to access
 
04:59:17.090 --> 04:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
all that information so we have a place
 
04:59:19.550 --> 04:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's a place to put it and then it will
 
04:59:22.550 --> 04:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
drive decision making down the road
 
04:59:25.070 --> 04:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
um uh as far as privacy concerns uh
 
04:59:29.690 --> 04:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
around the um the study DHHS is a HIPAA
 
04:59:32.510 --> 04:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
covered entity uh it safeguards and
 
04:59:35.090 --> 04:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
secures any personally identified by
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
excuse me identifiable data and
 
04:59:39.170 --> 04:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
information for federal regulations
 
04:59:41.090 --> 04:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
um information would be self-reported by
 
04:59:43.490 --> 04:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
by individuals identified as a case via
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
a survey and it would be securely stored
 
04:59:48.530 --> 04:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
in a public health database all
 
04:59:50.150 --> 04:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
summaries and ports would aggregate the
 
04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
results uh to protect privacy and
 
04:59:52.320 --> 04:59:55.190 align:start position:0%
results uh to protect privacy and
confidentiality

04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
um you know I know that there's a
 
04:59:59.690 --> 04:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
there's a a um appropriation
 
05:00:02.990 --> 05:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
um involved here and you know I want to
 
05:00:04.910 --> 05:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
answer the question as to why is this
 
05:00:07.250 --> 05:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
study worth the money that we're asking
 
05:00:09.470 --> 05:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
be appropriated
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh this the feasibility study uh would
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
provide information that we don't have
 
05:00:15.120 --> 05:00:16.010 align:start position:0%
provide information that we don't have
now

05:00:16.010 --> 05:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:00:18.350 --> 05:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
um and around people that have diagnosed
 
05:00:20.330 --> 05:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
with cancer while living in Merrimack
 
05:00:23.090 --> 05:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that could help inform the
 
05:00:25.368 --> 05:00:25.378 align:start position:0%
development of a research proposal for
 
05:00:27.770 --> 05:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
that epidemiological study that I I
 
05:00:29.150 --> 05:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
05:00:30.530 --> 05:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and help us understand the difference
 
05:00:32.288 --> 05:00:32.298 align:start position:0%
in risk factors
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge drives decision making and for
 
05:00:37.490 --> 05:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
example living in a highly impacted pfas
 
05:00:40.190 --> 05:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
Community like Merrimack we must be able
 
05:00:42.530 --> 05:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
to show that there's increased risk and
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
negative human impacts on New Hampshire
 
05:00:46.730 --> 05:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
citizens associated with that exposure
 
05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
if we're ever really going to be able to
 
05:00:51.350 --> 05:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
truly impact our environment and the
 
05:00:54.170 --> 05:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
human health from risk these negative
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes increase health care
 
05:00:59.090 --> 05:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
costs to Citizens and government and
 
05:01:01.070 --> 05:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the quality and lives
 
05:01:03.288 --> 05:01:03.298 align:start position:0%
of our of our citizens
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh representatives from DHHS are here
 
05:01:08.090 --> 05:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
are far better equipped to answer many
 
05:01:09.530 --> 05:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
of the specific questions relative to
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
the study
 
05:01:13.010 --> 05:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and I know they're they're here and
 
05:01:14.510 --> 05:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
willing to do that
 
05:01:16.550 --> 05:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of a community greatly and
 
05:01:18.948 --> 05:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
disproportionately negative impacted by
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
a life-altering cancer diagnosis
 
05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
one known to be associated with the pfas
 
05:01:26.090 --> 05:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
contamination we have had long-term and
 
05:01:28.430 --> 05:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing exposure to I ask that you
 
05:01:31.788 --> 05:01:31.798 align:start position:0%
please vote OTP on HB 614 thank you for
 
05:01:33.410 --> 05:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
your time and attention have you taken
 
05:01:35.090 --> 05:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
questions representative or do you want
 
05:01:37.490 --> 05:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
to defer those through HHS
 
05:01:38.990 --> 05:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I I would imagine that probably many
 
05:01:40.490 --> 05:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
of the questions would probably be more
 
05:01:42.470 --> 05:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
specific to the study but I can answer
 
05:01:43.910 --> 05:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions if any questions for
 
05:01:46.670 --> 05:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
05:01:49.550 --> 05:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
okay and we will pick it up thank you so
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:57.350 --> 05:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay also a sign up to testify is
 
05:02:08.090 --> 05:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.830 --> 05:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
05:02:12.890 --> 05:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
Rosemarie wrong I'm a state
 
05:02:14.930 --> 05:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative from Hillsboro 12 which
 
05:02:17.150 --> 05:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
is the town of Merrimack I'm not going
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
to repeat uh the comments of
 
05:02:21.288 --> 05:02:21.298 align:start position:0%
Representative Murphy but I do want to
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
say that for the past three years I've
 
05:02:25.490 --> 05:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
been a member of the pfas commission
 
05:02:29.410 --> 05:02:29.420 align:start position:0%
that resulted from the passage of HB 737
 
05:02:32.330 --> 05:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
it's comprised of representatives from
 
05:02:34.910 --> 05:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
the towns of Merrimack Bedford and
 
05:02:37.788 --> 05:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
Litchfield last year we added the town
 
05:02:40.550 --> 05:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
of Londonderry to be represented since
 
05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
they have also been impacted by pvas
 
05:02:44.270 --> 05:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
contamination from the Merrimack
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
operations of Saint Cobain the last two
 
05:02:49.490 --> 05:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
years I've served as chair and one of
 
05:02:52.730 --> 05:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
the observations I've held and I I'm
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's been shared by other members of the
 
05:02:57.170 --> 05:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
commission and by people in the
 
05:02:58.970 --> 05:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
communities is we don't have
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive data to really understand
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
the impact and the extent of of the
 
05:03:06.650 --> 05:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
health impacts from this contamination
 
05:03:06.660 --> 05:03:08.868 align:start position:0%
health impacts from this contamination
and

05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:10.550 --> 05:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
um many times in the community people
 
05:03:13.550 --> 05:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
just rely on anecdotal stories about
 
05:03:15.230 --> 05:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
cancer oh this neighborhood's been
 
05:03:17.628 --> 05:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
really impacted and that type of
 
05:03:17.638 --> 05:03:19.910 align:start position:0%
really impacted and that type of
speculation

05:03:19.910 --> 05:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
speculation
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
um really damages The credibility of
 
05:03:26.030 --> 05:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
decision making that we need to make and
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
an accountability for what's going on
 
05:03:32.330 --> 05:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
the last point I want to make in support
 
05:03:35.390 --> 05:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
of this bill is that I believe this
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
feasibility study will help DHHS and
 
05:03:40.850 --> 05:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
I'll let them speak for themselves but
 
05:03:44.090 --> 05:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
but my opinion is that it would help
 
05:03:46.670 --> 05:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
them identify infrastructure processes
 
05:03:49.010 --> 05:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
and procedures that can be applied to
 
05:03:52.190 --> 05:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
much other situations or other diseases
 
05:03:54.890 --> 05:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
or other ways that we can more
 
05:03:57.230 --> 05:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively collect data
 
05:04:00.288 --> 05:04:00.298 align:start position:0%
to be able to drive good decisions that
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
benefit New Hampshire
 
05:04:04.490 --> 05:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
so with that I would be happy to take
 
05:04:05.930 --> 05:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:04:10.910 --> 05:04:10.920 align:start position:0%

HB 614 presented today by representative
 
05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%

Department's recommendations regarding

next steps in exploring potential
 
05:07:23.448 --> 05:07:23.458 align:start position:0%
exposures that could have contributed to

observed in Merrimack rather than
 
05:07:30.650 --> 05:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
requesting the department to collect
 
05:07:33.708 --> 05:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
data on reported adverse Health impacts
 
05:07:37.250 --> 05:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
in a voluntary pfas repository which was
 
05:07:39.530 --> 05:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
which was the language including
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
included as the in the bill as

the department has worked in
 
05:07:47.150 --> 05:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
collaboration with representative Murphy
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the proposed language
 
05:07:51.650 --> 05:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
modification we would which would
 
05:07:53.868 --> 05:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
provide necessary funds to support the
 
05:07:56.448 --> 05:07:56.458 align:start position:0%
Department's recommendation to conduct a
 
05:07:58.430 --> 05:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
feasibility study that would be
 
05:08:00.410 --> 05:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
completed through a contract with an
 
05:08:03.230 --> 05:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
academic or research organization and
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
would inform next steps of the
 
05:08:05.160 --> 05:08:08.868 align:start position:0%
would inform next steps of the
investigation

05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:08.878 --> 05:08:11.170 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

05:08:11.170 --> 05:08:11.180 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:08:13.810 --> 05:08:13.820 align:start position:0%
the department recommends that this
 
05:08:16.430 --> 05:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
investigation moved to phase three in
 
05:08:18.410 --> 05:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
accordance with the Department's cancer
 
05:08:21.170 --> 05:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
concern investigation protocol which
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
includes a feasibility study as noted
 
05:08:25.610 --> 05:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
early this earlier the study would
 
05:08:28.368 --> 05:08:28.378 align:start position:0%
require additional funding and
 
05:08:30.410 --> 05:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
partnership with an academic or research
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
organization the phase three study would
 
05:08:35.750 --> 05:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
determine if an epidemiological study or
 
05:08:36.910 --> 05:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
phase four
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
in in as we refer to it in the cancer
 
05:08:43.070 --> 05:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
concern investigation protocol whether
 
05:08:45.288 --> 05:08:45.298 align:start position:0%
that epidemiological study would be
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
warranted and if it would identify
 
05:08:50.750 --> 05:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate Cancers and health outcomes
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
for inclusion in the study the proposed
 
05:08:57.170 --> 05:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
500 000 appropriation to be a provided
 
05:09:00.590 --> 05:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
for the biennium ending June 30th 2023
 
05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
to the department would help fund this
 
05:09:03.480 --> 05:09:04.430 align:start position:0%
to the department would help fund this
study

05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:09:06.770 --> 05:09:06.780 align:start position:0%
and we would be happy to answer any
 
05:09:08.868 --> 05:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have on the
 
05:09:10.670 --> 05:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
amendment or provide any more detail
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
around the reports to the commission
 
05:09:16.430 --> 05:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
 
05:09:20.750 --> 05:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
so you made reference in your testimony
 
05:09:27.288 --> 05:09:27.298 align:start position:0%
to the study the doctor that
 
05:09:30.490 --> 05:09:30.500 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy was talking about
 
05:09:34.610 --> 05:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
and um I guess I'm just wondering is is
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
this the language that you prefer at
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
this point the language of the amendment
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
is presented or do you think that this
 
05:09:42.288 --> 05:09:42.298 align:start position:0%
needs further work I'm not under I
 
05:09:44.208 --> 05:09:44.218 align:start position:0%
wasn't unjust clear about that sorry
 
05:09:46.190 --> 05:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
about that no we are supportive of the
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
current language okay the amendment the
 
05:09:50.330 --> 05:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
amendment Amendment thank you I just
 
05:09:53.690 --> 05:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure I had that right yeah
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's consistent just it's consistent
 
05:10:00.530 --> 05:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:04.610 --> 05:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:06.288 --> 05:10:06.298 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you very much
 
05:10:08.750 --> 05:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:10:10.850 --> 05:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
I know of no one else signed up to
 
05:10:12.650 --> 05:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
testify is there anyone here who wishes
 
05:10:17.208 --> 05:10:17.218 align:start position:0%

bringing this bill to completion
 
05:11:07.740 --> 05:11:09.430 align:start position:0%

induced pregnancy termination statistics
 
05:11:23.890 --> 05:11:23.900 align:start position:0%
short form as abortion statistics

our past
 
05:11:29.570 --> 05:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
um really brief history was the last
 
05:11:29.580 --> 05:11:30.470 align:start position:0%
um really brief history was the last
bill

05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:11:33.530 --> 05:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
the last session was 1654 that got
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
tabled along with an attempted Amendment
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
and before that was 158
 
05:11:44.030 --> 05:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:11:47.150 --> 05:11:47.160 align:start position:0%

um

05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:53.448 --> 05:11:53.458 align:start position:0%
well I don't know what the numbers might
 
05:11:56.270 --> 05:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
be but we've had a number of iterations
 
05:11:58.610 --> 05:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
and a number of attempts
 
05:12:00.890 --> 05:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
and we've learned from each one of those
 
05:12:00.900 --> 05:12:02.410 align:start position:0%
and we've learned from each one of those
attempts

05:12:02.410 --> 05:12:02.420 align:start position:0%
attempts
 
05:12:06.350 --> 05:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
to rectify shortcomings and address
 
05:12:10.010 --> 05:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
concerns especially for privacy
 
05:12:14.330 --> 05:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
and the collection use and
 
05:12:17.628 --> 05:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
distribution of non-identifying
 
05:12:23.448 --> 05:12:23.458 align:start position:0%
anonymous anonymous data so that no
 
05:12:27.050 --> 05:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
persons are identified in any way either
 
05:12:29.628 --> 05:12:29.638 align:start position:0%
by location or by person or any other
 
05:12:29.638 --> 05:12:32.708 align:start position:0%
by location or by person or any other
effects

05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:35.330 --> 05:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:12:38.330 --> 05:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
why is it important
 
05:12:41.208 --> 05:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
we're a population now of about 340
 
05:12:43.610 --> 05:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
million people
 
05:12:46.010 --> 05:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
according to the good marker Institute
 
05:12:48.890 --> 05:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
the CDC the American Life league and
 
05:12:51.530 --> 05:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
several other organizations
 
05:12:55.610 --> 05:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
since 1973 when Roe v Wade was declared
 
05:12:58.368 --> 05:12:58.378 align:start position:0%
in doe versus Bolton
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
we've had something like 63 million
 
05:13:03.170 --> 05:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
abortions accounted for
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
probably more because many of them maybe
 
05:13:10.010 --> 05:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
otherwise classified as miscarriages or
 
05:13:12.650 --> 05:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
not reported or
 
05:13:15.948 --> 05:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
somehow slipped through the cracks
 
05:13:18.590 --> 05:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
and you know if you were to add the
 
05:13:21.050 --> 05:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
effect of contraception which is not
 
05:13:23.628 --> 05:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
part of this bill I'm just talking in
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
context here
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
you probably would be short of a hundred
 
05:13:28.560 --> 05:13:29.690 align:start position:0%
you probably would be short of a hundred
million

05:13:29.690 --> 05:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
births since 1973.
 
05:13:37.368 --> 05:13:37.378 align:start position:0%
that's a large segment of population
 
05:13:39.890 --> 05:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
and is it any Wonder these days that we
 
05:13:39.900 --> 05:13:40.670 align:start position:0%
and is it any Wonder these days that we
see

05:13:40.670 --> 05:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:13:42.350 --> 05:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
help wanted
 
05:13:44.448 --> 05:13:44.458 align:start position:0%
now hiring
 
05:13:48.590 --> 05:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
a shortage of employees in every venue
 
05:13:51.050 --> 05:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
in every industry
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care too
 
05:13:58.670 --> 05:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
so this is a huge impact
 
05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
on American population and American
 
05:14:01.440 --> 05:14:03.530 align:start position:0%
on American population and American
Health

05:14:03.530 --> 05:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
Health
 
05:14:06.410 --> 05:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
now we report
 
05:14:10.010 --> 05:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
all kinds of health statistics
 
05:14:13.250 --> 05:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
in just about every way possible
 
05:14:15.410 --> 05:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Health and Human
 
05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
Services has a health wisdom site maybe
 
05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
differently named now in
 
05:14:21.360 --> 05:14:23.448 align:start position:0%
differently named now in
transition

05:14:23.448 --> 05:14:23.458 align:start position:0%
transition
 
05:14:25.788 --> 05:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
that you can find just about every
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
Melody and ailment and condition
 
05:14:31.788 --> 05:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
concerning human health on that except
 
05:14:31.798 --> 05:14:33.368 align:start position:0%
concerning human health on that except
for

05:14:33.368 --> 05:14:33.378 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:14:35.930 --> 05:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
05:14:40.250 --> 05:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
induced pregnancy termination statistics
 
05:14:42.350 --> 05:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
and I would submit to you many claim
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
that abortion is Health Care well if
 
05:14:46.128 --> 05:14:46.138 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
05:14:49.368 --> 05:14:49.378 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that also be a component of
 
05:14:51.948 --> 05:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
the state's concern
 
05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
the concern of the people to know what's
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
happening in that realm of Health
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
instead of tucking it away in the corner
 
05:15:03.050 --> 05:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
and putting a dark cloth over the top of
 
05:15:03.060 --> 05:15:05.628 align:start position:0%
and putting a dark cloth over the top of
it

05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:09.230 --> 05:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
so we worked
 
05:15:13.070 --> 05:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
to find what would be best
 
05:15:16.788 --> 05:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
practices for reporting from the
 
05:15:19.250 --> 05:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
standpoint of privacy
 
05:15:23.270 --> 05:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
keeping this keeping data discrete
 
05:15:26.330 --> 05:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
collection very regimented
 
05:15:32.930 --> 05:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
and final reporting by DHHS
 
05:15:36.170 --> 05:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
under strict safety criteria and
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:39.600 --> 05:15:42.288 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:15:42.288 --> 05:15:42.298 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:15:45.170 --> 05:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records and the
 
05:15:47.570 --> 05:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State offices has the
 
05:15:50.030 --> 05:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
Machinery to collect
 
05:15:53.448 --> 05:15:53.458 align:start position:0%
all kinds of critical life data like
 
05:15:55.610 --> 05:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
marriages births deaths
 
05:15:59.690 --> 05:15:59.700 align:start position:0%
and are well suited to handle this task
 
05:16:03.770 --> 05:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
also with an addition of a module
 
05:16:06.350 --> 05:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
some years ago
 
05:16:09.530 --> 05:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
several years I'm not sure when
 
05:16:12.288 --> 05:16:12.298 align:start position:0%
that responsibility for data collection
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
was taken from the Department of Health
 
05:16:17.208 --> 05:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and moved over to
 
05:16:20.570 --> 05:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
so we were able to determine earlier on
 
05:16:26.330 --> 05:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
in the last 1654 bill that that was the
 
05:16:30.708 --> 05:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
proper continued proper venue for that
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
the department
 
05:16:36.590 --> 05:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire research office of
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
legislative research helped
 
05:16:40.730 --> 05:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
to discern
 
05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
what the standard reporting requirements
 
05:16:45.948 --> 05:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
would best be
 
05:16:48.948 --> 05:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
on this particular subject
 
05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
and in the bill
 
05:16:54.830 --> 05:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
there is an itemization
 
05:16:57.890 --> 05:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
that basically was taken off the form
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:05.868 --> 05:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
from the CDC
 
05:17:10.368 --> 05:17:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:15.650 --> 05:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:20.030 --> 05:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
page three starting at line 14.
 
05:17:21.410 --> 05:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
05:17:23.390 --> 05:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
um itemized
 
05:17:25.070 --> 05:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
items there
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
are um taken from the CDC specification
 
05:17:31.730 --> 05:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
and why do we use the CDC specification
 
05:17:35.150 --> 05:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
because 47 other states use it
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire California and Maryland
 
05:17:39.230 --> 05:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
are the only three that do not report
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't make sense if this is
 
05:17:45.170 --> 05:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
an important statistic it should be
 
05:17:47.868 --> 05:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
reportable by all states and we should
 
05:17:51.288 --> 05:17:51.298 align:start position:0%
we should join the other 47
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
not only for National figures but also
 
05:17:57.890 --> 05:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
so that we know what's going on in the
 
05:17:57.900 --> 05:17:59.030 align:start position:0%
so that we know what's going on in the
state

05:17:59.030 --> 05:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:18:02.868 --> 05:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
and can read understand and know the
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
but for the sake of reporting the CDC
 
05:18:15.230 --> 05:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
specification does make sense
 
05:18:16.970 --> 05:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
because they've been down this road
 
05:18:19.850 --> 05:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
before and it's worked for 47 other
 
05:18:19.860 --> 05:18:21.830 align:start position:0%
before and it's worked for 47 other
states

05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
the big question was
 
05:18:26.510 --> 05:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
how are we going to protect the data
 
05:18:29.448 --> 05:18:29.458 align:start position:0%
so that individuals are not
 
05:18:29.458 --> 05:18:31.810 align:start position:0%
so that individuals are not
disclosed

05:18:31.810 --> 05:18:31.820 align:start position:0%
disclosed
 
05:18:35.868 --> 05:18:35.878 align:start position:0%
or make known and so
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
the system sets up a confidential
 
05:18:40.440 --> 05:18:41.330 align:start position:0%
the system sets up a confidential
um

05:18:41.330 --> 05:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:43.610 --> 05:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
provider number
 
05:18:43.620 --> 05:18:44.930 align:start position:0%
provider number
and

05:18:44.930 --> 05:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:18:46.730 --> 05:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
a confidential
 
05:18:50.090 --> 05:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
patient number and that resides with the
 
05:18:50.100 --> 05:18:52.090 align:start position:0%
patient number and that resides with the
provider

05:18:52.090 --> 05:18:52.100 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:18:55.250 --> 05:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
the data goes to
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records
 
05:18:59.530 --> 05:18:59.540 align:start position:0%
in aggregate
 
05:19:02.330 --> 05:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
non-identifying form
 
05:19:04.730 --> 05:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
and those figures are
 
05:19:07.550 --> 05:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
tallied and aggregated
 
05:19:12.050 --> 05:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
and then when complete for the period or
 
05:19:13.970 --> 05:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
year then it turned over the Department
 
05:19:16.190 --> 05:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services for their
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
inclusion along with other Health Data
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:26.590 --> 05:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
as I say we had
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
challenges of the concern of privacy and
 
05:19:31.730 --> 05:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
rightly so
 
05:19:33.470 --> 05:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
and we think we've addressed that
 
05:19:33.480 --> 05:19:35.030 align:start position:0%
and we think we've addressed that
completely

05:19:35.030 --> 05:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
completely
 
05:19:39.490 --> 05:19:39.500 align:start position:0%
and this is the fifth attempt and uh
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
I think we've we've covered all of the
 
05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
concerns and patched all of the unknowns
 
05:19:46.970 --> 05:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
05:19:49.550 --> 05:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
the only thing we're waiting for now is
 
05:19:49.560 --> 05:19:51.050 align:start position:0%
the only thing we're waiting for now is
a

05:19:51.050 --> 05:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:19:53.090 --> 05:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
Financial note from the Department of
 
05:19:55.128 --> 05:19:55.138 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services relative to
 
05:19:56.510 --> 05:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
their cost
 
05:19:58.490 --> 05:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
for publication
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
the discrete publication within their
 
05:20:00.718 --> 05:20:02.510 align:start position:0%
the discrete publication within their
system

05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:20:06.128 --> 05:20:06.138 align:start position:0%
I see that the financial note from
 
05:20:06.138 --> 05:20:07.788 align:start position:0%
I see that the financial note from
the

05:20:07.788 --> 05:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records
 
05:20:14.448 --> 05:20:14.458 align:start position:0%
shows uh
 
05:20:17.090 --> 05:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
expenditures of 25
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
000 to 50 thousand dollars for the
 
05:20:21.530 --> 05:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
addition of the module onto their
 
05:20:24.650 --> 05:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.930 --> 05:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
I think that's a completely reasonable
 
05:20:26.940 --> 05:20:28.128 align:start position:0%
I think that's a completely reasonable
amount

05:20:28.128 --> 05:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
amount
 
05:20:31.010 --> 05:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
and even though we don't know the DHHS
 
05:20:32.350 --> 05:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
figure yet
 
05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine that it can be far
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
exceeding out of range of that
 
05:20:40.128 --> 05:20:40.138 align:start position:0%
reasonable number
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
but they maybe can testify on that and
 
05:20:47.390 --> 05:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
or produce the FN as requested here
 
05:20:47.400 --> 05:20:49.730 align:start position:0%
or produce the FN as requested here
before

05:20:49.730 --> 05:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.368 --> 05:20:52.378 align:start position:0%
so that's basically my summary and I'd
 
05:20:55.070 --> 05:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions on the
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
Stapleton before you leave today could
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
you make sure you've fill out a pink
 
05:21:00.050 --> 05:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
card we don't have one from you I'm
 
05:21:01.850 --> 05:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
sorry I will do that thank you sir our
 
05:21:04.128 --> 05:21:04.138 align:start position:0%
records questions for representative
 
05:21:08.708 --> 05:21:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.208 --> 05:21:11.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton for taking my
 
05:21:12.718 --> 05:21:14.090 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton for taking my
question

05:21:14.090 --> 05:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:21:17.208 --> 05:21:17.218 align:start position:0%
could you help me explain why in the
 
05:21:17.218 --> 05:21:18.050 align:start position:0%
could you help me explain why in the
bill

05:21:18.050 --> 05:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:21:21.170 --> 05:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
on page five
 
05:21:25.010 --> 05:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
line six seven and eight are there
 
05:21:26.690 --> 05:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about patient
 
05:21:29.930 --> 05:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and you're saying
 
05:21:32.510 --> 05:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
that would be kept completely sacred and
 
05:21:34.788 --> 05:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
protected then why do we need to have
 
05:21:38.750 --> 05:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
um this page five line six seven and
 
05:21:41.638 --> 05:21:42.650 align:start position:0%
um this page five line six seven and
eight

05:21:42.650 --> 05:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
eight
 
05:21:46.128 --> 05:21:46.138 align:start position:0%
just so everybody knows that reads Roman

05:22:12.590 --> 05:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:14.990 --> 05:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
try to cover all the aspects of law
 
05:22:17.708 --> 05:22:17.718 align:start position:0%
including RSA 91
 
05:22:17.718 --> 05:22:19.250 align:start position:0%
including RSA 91
and

05:22:19.250 --> 05:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:22.070 --> 05:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
um that is just I had help with this
 
05:22:25.128 --> 05:22:25.138 align:start position:0%
with a number of people an attorney
 
05:22:28.490 --> 05:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
that suggested that this is an important
 
05:22:30.850 --> 05:22:30.860 align:start position:0%
component of this bill
 
05:22:34.368 --> 05:22:34.378 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so my concern is
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
that the reason why that would be here
 
05:22:38.330 --> 05:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
05:22:40.430 --> 05:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
is the fact that that data that we're
 
05:22:42.530 --> 05:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
talking about being so private in
 
05:22:44.810 --> 05:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
reality may not be as private as we
 
05:22:46.430 --> 05:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be so therefore we
 
05:22:48.650 --> 05:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
have to be sure it's excluded from
 
05:22:48.660 --> 05:22:49.910 align:start position:0%
have to be sure it's excluded from
Discovery

05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
Discovery
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so my concern goes back to the same
 
05:22:55.310 --> 05:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
question about is privacy we had a
 
05:22:57.170 --> 05:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
meeting this morning on another bill
 
05:23:01.010 --> 05:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
about the issue of data integrity
 
05:23:02.270 --> 05:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we're going to give the department
 
05:23:04.368 --> 05:23:04.378 align:start position:0%
some very sensitive data
 
05:23:05.868 --> 05:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
and we're not even sure they have the
 
05:23:07.250 --> 05:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
ability to protect the data we have
 
05:23:07.260 --> 05:23:08.330 align:start position:0%
ability to protect the data we have
today

05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:23:09.770 --> 05:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
and our concern
 
05:23:11.330 --> 05:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
on this bill how that's what I'm trying
 
05:23:13.850 --> 05:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
to understand from your point of view
 
05:23:16.368 --> 05:23:16.378 align:start position:0%
how are we going to ensure that the data
 
05:23:18.170 --> 05:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
that's being collected I don't think we
 
05:23:19.490 --> 05:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
have to collect the number one but it's
 
05:23:21.288 --> 05:23:21.298 align:start position:0%
going to be really protected because
 
05:23:23.270 --> 05:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
everything I'm reading through this
 
05:23:26.330 --> 05:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
there are concerns about its privacy and
 
05:23:26.340 --> 05:23:28.730 align:start position:0%
there are concerns about its privacy and
security

05:23:28.730 --> 05:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:31.788 --> 05:23:31.798 align:start position:0%
from what I understand is that the
 
05:23:34.128 --> 05:23:34.138 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:23:36.708 --> 05:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
and the division of Vital Records have
 
05:23:37.970 --> 05:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
not had
 
05:23:41.708 --> 05:23:41.718 align:start position:0%
outages relative to Health Data
 
05:23:44.330 --> 05:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
and maybe they've had one or two blips
 
05:23:47.750 --> 05:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
but from last testimonies I've heard
 
05:23:49.490 --> 05:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
we've got a pretty good and secure
 
05:23:51.350 --> 05:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
system in the state
 
05:23:53.690 --> 05:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
if there's a violational law and there's
 
05:23:56.030 --> 05:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
a court order
 
05:23:58.788 --> 05:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
um for disclosure
 
05:24:00.890 --> 05:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
that's not something that the Department
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services or the
 
05:24:05.810 --> 05:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records is going to
 
05:24:08.448 --> 05:24:08.458 align:start position:0%
disclose they don't have the ability to
 
05:24:11.270 --> 05:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
do so because of the aggregated nature
 
05:24:13.070 --> 05:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
of the collected data
 
05:24:15.050 --> 05:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
court order will have to go right to the
 
05:24:15.060 --> 05:24:16.250 align:start position:0%
court order will have to go right to the
provider

05:24:16.250 --> 05:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:24:18.530 --> 05:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
for that particular information and
 
05:24:22.128 --> 05:24:22.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:27.650 --> 05:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:30.050 --> 05:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
see any okay thank you representative
 
05:24:31.970 --> 05:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you please don't forget
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:40.610 --> 05:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
okay next uh next person who signed up
 
05:24:43.030 --> 05:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
to testify is representative Daniel Papa
 
05:24:45.530 --> 05:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
bovich right
 
05:24:45.540 --> 05:24:48.350 align:start position:0%
bovich right
Miller

05:24:48.350 --> 05:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
Miller
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a lot of line on
 
05:24:52.010 --> 05:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
those cards to write a long name thank
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
05:24:56.750 --> 05:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate it I promised you on
 
05:24:58.430 --> 05:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
the card that I'll keep it to one minute
 
05:25:00.288 --> 05:25:00.298 align:start position:0%
I'll just steal a few seconds at the
 
05:25:02.930 --> 05:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
beginning of this testimony to bring up
 
05:25:05.990 --> 05:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
that I am a co-sponsor an hb397 that
 
05:25:08.030 --> 05:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
came to the committee this morning and I
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
it was my intent to come testifying
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
support but I am the clerk for the
 
05:25:14.448 --> 05:25:14.458 align:start position:0%
finance 2 committee and there was no way
 
05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
for me to uh you know excuse myself from
 
05:25:19.788 --> 05:25:19.798 align:start position:0%
that meeting so I just wanted to quickly
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
bring that up
 
05:25:25.490 --> 05:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
and this is in my opinion a clear
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
necessity this bill and this data
 
05:25:30.590 --> 05:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
because of the amazingly contentious
 
05:25:32.990 --> 05:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
nature of those types of decisions that
 
05:25:35.330 --> 05:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
we have to make as a legislature
 
05:25:37.970 --> 05:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of passions and heated
 
05:25:39.948 --> 05:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
you know positions on both sides of the
 
05:25:42.110 --> 05:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
aisle and I think it would behoove all
 
05:25:44.810 --> 05:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
of us to have a good understanding of
 
05:25:47.330 --> 05:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
what is actually going on how many of
 
05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
these procedures happen when do they
 
05:25:52.610 --> 05:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
happen data is not designed to support
 
05:25:55.250 --> 05:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
one stance or the other it's just meant
 
05:25:57.230 --> 05:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
to inform us and help us understand
 
05:25:59.448 --> 05:25:59.458 align:start position:0%
exactly what's going on so we can all
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
make more more informed decisions I
 
05:26:04.128 --> 05:26:04.138 align:start position:0%
completely agree with the concern for
 
05:26:06.288 --> 05:26:06.298 align:start position:0%
the privacy of the data I think it is
 
05:26:08.230 --> 05:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
essential that this is just
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
non-identifiable aggregate data for
 
05:26:14.510 --> 05:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
policy reasons it should not be used in
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
any way to you know disclose information
 
05:26:18.708 --> 05:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
about an individual so those safeguards
 
05:26:20.208 --> 05:26:20.218 align:start position:0%
in my opinion are already in the bill
 
05:26:22.430 --> 05:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
and to me that additional layer of
 
05:26:24.530 --> 05:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
security was just a catch-all in case
 
05:26:27.288 --> 05:26:27.298 align:start position:0%
other parts of the law may not be fully
 
05:26:29.030 --> 05:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
adhered to it's better to have more
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
layers of support than too few in the
 
05:26:33.230 --> 05:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
hope that there are all they're not all
 
05:26:36.288 --> 05:26:36.298 align:start position:0%
needed but again I strongly support this
 
05:26:38.810 --> 05:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
bill and similar types of bills because
 
05:26:40.550 --> 05:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
as policy makers we need to understand
 
05:26:43.010 --> 05:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
the impact of the bills we pass that
 
05:26:44.448 --> 05:26:44.458 align:start position:0%
includes understanding how many people
 
05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
will be affected and how and you know to
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
me that's critical information and I
 
05:26:50.208 --> 05:26:50.218 align:start position:0%
would urge all of you to consider
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
supporting it thank you very much for
 
05:26:53.090 --> 05:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
the time
 
05:26:55.368 --> 05:26:55.378 align:start position:0%
thank you questions uh representative
 
05:26:55.378 --> 05:26:57.470 align:start position:0%
thank you questions uh representative
Weber

05:26:57.470 --> 05:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
05:26:59.150 --> 05:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:27:02.090 --> 05:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh does it make sense
 
05:27:05.350 --> 05:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
to you that we involve
 
05:27:09.288 --> 05:27:09.298 align:start position:0%
first one division in collecting this
 
05:27:12.910 --> 05:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
data and then the transport of the data
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Health which is
 
05:27:17.590 --> 05:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
actually what we're talking about
 
05:27:21.770 --> 05:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make more sense to collect
 
05:27:25.070 --> 05:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
transmit the data just once thereby
 
05:27:28.550 --> 05:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh lessening the possibility of a slip
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
and putting it immediately in the place
 
05:27:34.550 --> 05:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
which is where it's destined to go
 
05:27:37.610 --> 05:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
very honestly any method that the
 
05:27:39.830 --> 05:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee finds the most desirable to
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
achieve this result I will
 
05:27:44.208 --> 05:27:44.218 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically support you have more
 
05:27:47.150 --> 05:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
information on all the you know details
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
involved and at the end of the day
 
05:27:50.208 --> 05:27:50.218 align:start position:0%
regardless who the sponsor is on this
 
05:27:52.730 --> 05:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
bill it becomes a committee's bill and
 
05:27:55.010 --> 05:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
anything any method in which you can
 
05:27:56.930 --> 05:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
achieve this objective I will be very
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
happy with I'm not really invested in
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's this department or their
 
05:28:03.230 --> 05:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
Department whichever method does the job
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
of just providing this reporting and
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
this information I will be happy with
 
05:28:11.868 --> 05:28:11.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant thank
 
05:28:13.730 --> 05:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:28:13.740 --> 05:28:14.990 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

05:28:14.990 --> 05:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
if the focus is on the what and not the
 
05:28:18.958 --> 05:28:19.788 align:start position:0%
if the focus is on the what and not the
who

05:28:19.788 --> 05:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:28:22.430 --> 05:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
could we not eliminate The Who
 
05:28:24.410 --> 05:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
eliminate the patient and provider just
 
05:28:27.230 --> 05:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
collect aggregated data and therefore we
 
05:28:29.628 --> 05:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to risk any concerns with
 
05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
privacy and security about privacy but
 
05:28:34.490 --> 05:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
just collect the what and not the who
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
I believe that right now the patient
 
05:28:38.570 --> 05:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
identity is not collected at all it is
 
05:28:40.490 --> 05:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
the information you know it's just a
 
05:28:42.230 --> 05:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
code number that is only known to the
 
05:28:42.240 --> 05:28:43.730 align:start position:0%
code number that is only known to the
provider

05:28:43.730 --> 05:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:28:46.670 --> 05:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
I believe that it is necessary in order
 
05:28:49.070 --> 05:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
to verify the Integrity of the data if
 
05:28:50.750 --> 05:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
it ever comes called into question if
 
05:28:52.970 --> 05:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
you ever have to audit an a medical
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
provider for failing to comply with this
 
05:28:58.070 --> 05:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know I mean at the end of the day
 
05:28:59.868 --> 05:28:59.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't see any enforcement
 
05:29:01.730 --> 05:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in this law right now this is
 
05:29:04.730 --> 05:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
a pure requirement but as a data person
 
05:29:06.708 --> 05:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
I used to be a database developer I
 
05:29:09.288 --> 05:29:09.298 align:start position:0%
wrote a lot of code your data is only
 
05:29:11.810 --> 05:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
good if you can at some point spot check
 
05:29:14.270 --> 05:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
it and verify I do not foresee this
 
05:29:16.010 --> 05:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
being you know
 
05:29:19.070 --> 05:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
a huge issue but you know as I said at
 
05:29:20.570 --> 05:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
the end of the day
 
05:29:22.430 --> 05:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
any step forward that the committee
 
05:29:24.948 --> 05:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
comes up with will be welcomed even if
 
05:29:27.170 --> 05:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
it is maybe less you know than what the
 
05:29:30.590 --> 05:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
original uh intent of the bill was
 
05:29:40.910 --> 05:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:43.730 --> 05:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
physician by training I've delivered
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
babies taken care of uh prenatal women
 
05:29:48.770 --> 05:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm also Health Services researcher
 
05:29:51.170 --> 05:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
by training and I'm very hard-pressed to
 
05:29:52.970 --> 05:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
understand the actual reason for having
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
this kind of a bill I wonder if we would
 
05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:01.788 --> 05:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
um vasectomies and the number of
 
05:30:04.490 --> 05:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
gallbladders that are removed and other
 
05:30:07.310 --> 05:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
organs that are removed so I I really am
 
05:30:09.948 --> 05:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
struggling I am new but I'm I'm not
 
05:30:12.410 --> 05:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
understanding the reason for why this is
 
05:30:14.208 --> 05:30:14.218 align:start position:0%
something that needs as someone who
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
teaches others about data and the
 
05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
importance of its use in collection I
 
05:30:21.288 --> 05:30:21.298 align:start position:0%
really am hard-pressed so I'd appreciate
 
05:30:23.810 --> 05:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
um some some insight
 
05:30:26.690 --> 05:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you if I may address that
 
05:30:28.910 --> 05:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
I completely respect your professional
 
05:30:30.590 --> 05:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
opinion and obviously you know you have
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
chosen an amazingly rewarding career and
 
05:30:36.288 --> 05:30:36.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for serving so many people
 
05:30:39.230 --> 05:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
I hear you say that you know perhaps
 
05:30:40.490 --> 05:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
clinically you don't need this
 
05:30:42.590 --> 05:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
information to make those decisions but
 
05:30:45.230 --> 05:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
when I ran for election it was my first
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
time running for the house this year
 
05:30:50.750 --> 05:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't really open the topic much and
 
05:30:53.930 --> 05:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
yet half of every discussion came to
 
05:30:56.690 --> 05:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
these types of laws I think as
 
05:30:59.628 --> 05:30:59.638 align:start position:0%
legislators we have the duty to again
 
05:31:01.550 --> 05:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of the laws we
 
05:31:04.310 --> 05:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
passed as a provider absolutely you are
 
05:31:06.110 --> 05:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
focused on that one patient in front of
 
05:31:08.090 --> 05:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
you the decision is clear you don't need
 
05:31:10.128 --> 05:31:10.138 align:start position:0%
that for medical purposes but I believe
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
that as legislators we do need to
 
05:31:14.750 --> 05:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
collect this type of information when we
 
05:31:18.530 --> 05:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:21.830 --> 05:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative Seth King
 
05:31:23.750 --> 05:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:31:26.030 --> 05:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of you know hospitals and physical
 
05:31:28.190 --> 05:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
therapists and stuff like that they they
 
05:31:30.170 --> 05:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
love to boast their numbers about how
 
05:31:32.090 --> 05:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
many people they helped throughout the
 
05:31:34.970 --> 05:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
year it's usually pretty common I think
 
05:31:36.650 --> 05:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
um are the abortion providers
 
05:31:39.230 --> 05:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
intentionally not disclosing how many I
 
05:31:40.430 --> 05:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
mean aren't they really proud of how
 
05:31:42.530 --> 05:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
many abortions they've given and what I
 
05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
mean isn't this information already
 
05:31:46.490 --> 05:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
publicly available does it need to be
 
05:31:48.890 --> 05:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
done through the government or are they
 
05:31:50.750 --> 05:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
really keeping very tight-lipped about
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
how many they provide thank you thank
 
05:31:54.830 --> 05:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
you I obviously cannot speak for the
 
05:31:56.750 --> 05:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
intent of any medical provider in making
 
05:31:58.850 --> 05:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
whatever decisions they make I you know
 
05:32:01.190 --> 05:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not a mind reader I don't presume to
 
05:32:02.690 --> 05:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
have that
 
05:32:04.250 --> 05:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
I think there is a difference between
 
05:32:06.590 --> 05:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers that people
 
05:32:10.128 --> 05:32:10.138 align:start position:0%
sometimes publish voluntarily and uh you
 
05:32:11.690 --> 05:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
know more accurate numbers will be
 
05:32:15.948 --> 05:32:15.958 align:start position:0%
provided in order to um you know
 
05:32:19.490 --> 05:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
to comply with a legal mandate and also
 
05:32:21.890 --> 05:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
while a lot of them are talking about it
 
05:32:23.570 --> 05:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
some of them aren't just the data that's
 
05:32:25.550 --> 05:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
voluntarily reported of course a lot of
 
05:32:27.410 --> 05:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
data is voluntarily reported but
 
05:32:31.128 --> 05:32:31.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:33.708 --> 05:32:33.718 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative
 
05:32:37.850 --> 05:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
follow up on previous question uh would
 
05:32:41.208 --> 05:32:41.218 align:start position:0%
you imagine that on like uh late terms
 
05:32:43.868 --> 05:32:43.878 align:start position:0%
abortion we will have more data if it's
 
05:32:47.208 --> 05:32:47.218 align:start position:0%
a practice that exists or how common it
 
05:32:53.150 --> 05:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
is uh as opposed to General statistics
 
05:32:55.730 --> 05:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
on how many abortions will be available
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
if this
 
05:33:01.010 --> 05:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
take effect thank you I the bill is not
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
focused on one type of abortion on over
 
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
the other it's a bill that's focused on
 
05:33:07.010 --> 05:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
the system as a whole and the you know
 
05:33:10.670 --> 05:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
holistic you know complete data set of
 
05:33:12.890 --> 05:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
course when we start analyzing date
 
05:33:15.050 --> 05:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
complete data sets for policy reasons
 
05:33:17.628 --> 05:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
every legislature legislator may look at
 
05:33:20.090 --> 05:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
certain numbers or others but I think it
 
05:33:22.850 --> 05:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
is critical for all of us to start from
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
the same total numbers when we make
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
those decisions and then whatever area
 
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
one legislator May Focus over another
 
05:33:31.788 --> 05:33:31.798 align:start position:0%
that's up to the 400 people in the house
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
and 24 in the Senate and so on but
 
05:33:38.570 --> 05:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
I think at the end of the day
 
05:33:40.788 --> 05:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
we all look at it and have different
 
05:33:42.890 --> 05:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
numbers from different people wouldn't
 
05:33:45.170 --> 05:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
our decisions be better informed if we
 
05:33:47.510 --> 05:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
had a common number set of numbers to
 
05:33:50.448 --> 05:33:50.458 align:start position:0%
start our analysis from and just have
 
05:33:52.010 --> 05:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
the confidence that they have been
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
verified by state agencies who are you
 
05:33:57.830 --> 05:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
know trusted to report accurately who
 
05:33:59.390 --> 05:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
are non-partisan who will just report
 
05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
the data as is I think it's important to
 
05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
start from that common set of numbers
 
05:34:06.350 --> 05:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
when we look at the you know certain
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of this policy
 
05:34:12.410 --> 05:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:14.510 --> 05:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you thank you very much
 
05:34:18.770 --> 05:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:21.050 --> 05:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
next signed up to testify is deputy
 
05:34:32.750 --> 05:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:34.910 --> 05:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chamber and chairman and
 
05:34:36.350 --> 05:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's nice to
 
05:34:38.270 --> 05:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
see everyone today I am here to offer
 
05:34:41.090 --> 05:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
information about this bill and to ask
 
05:34:44.350 --> 05:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
for a clarification on one point
 
05:34:49.850 --> 05:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
as noted the division has noted the
 
05:34:52.788 --> 05:34:52.798 align:start position:0%
um amount estimated amount to create
 
05:34:55.010 --> 05:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
this new module the about fifty thousand
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
dollars we have a new vendor within our
 
05:34:59.150 --> 05:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records that's
 
05:35:02.690 --> 05:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
um creating our new modules and um we
 
05:35:04.310 --> 05:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
have a very good relationship with them
 
05:35:06.230 --> 05:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're very responsive so we're hoping
 
05:35:09.948 --> 05:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
that this fiscal note is accurate in in
 
05:35:11.270 --> 05:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
order to do this
 
05:35:14.750 --> 05:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
um the one question I do have for the
 
05:35:18.110 --> 05:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
committee and hopefully you you can look
 
05:35:19.850 --> 05:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
into this further and get back to us
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
because it could create more of a
 
05:35:24.770 --> 05:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
difficult situation in trying to perform
 
05:35:28.128 --> 05:35:28.138 align:start position:0%
what we are tasked to do with and that
 
05:35:30.170 --> 05:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
is on page two
 
05:35:32.990 --> 05:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
and it it surrounds the confidentiality
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the provider
 
05:35:38.390 --> 05:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
um and I see it kind of like a a circle
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
um just keep going around in a circle
 
05:35:42.708 --> 05:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
where we're not allowed to keep the
 
05:35:44.810 --> 05:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
names of a provider
 
05:35:47.330 --> 05:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
um any personal identifying information
 
05:35:50.350 --> 05:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
but we have to give providers
 
05:35:50.360 --> 05:35:51.910 align:start position:0%
but we have to give providers
confidential

05:35:51.910 --> 05:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
05:35:54.350 --> 05:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
numbers for their health care provider
 
05:35:57.650 --> 05:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
or for for the individual or for the
 
05:36:00.170 --> 05:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
provider the facility so I'm not quite
 
05:36:02.470 --> 05:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
sure how that would be done
 
05:36:05.390 --> 05:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
to give someone a confidential number
 
05:36:07.128 --> 05:36:07.138 align:start position:0%
without knowing who we're given a
 
05:36:09.050 --> 05:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
confidential number to so that's just
 
05:36:10.970 --> 05:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
one question that we would have need
 
05:36:13.128 --> 05:36:13.138 align:start position:0%
clarification on if this bill were to
 
05:36:16.788 --> 05:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
pass I'm happy to take questions
 
05:36:19.128 --> 05:36:19.138 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber
 
05:36:20.868 --> 05:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
for clarification could you tell me
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
where on page two you're subjecting to
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
the language sorry questioning the
 
05:36:26.510 --> 05:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
language it's not an objection it's a
 
05:36:26.520 --> 05:36:27.470 align:start position:0%
language it's not an objection it's a
concern

05:36:27.470 --> 05:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:36:30.770 --> 05:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
um it's um on page two lines 12 through
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
16. and then also looking down
 
05:36:37.490 --> 05:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
um lines 27 through 29.
 
05:36:40.970 --> 05:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:43.550 --> 05:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:36:45.530 --> 05:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
05:36:48.170 --> 05:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you
 
05:36:49.730 --> 05:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
05:36:54.770 --> 05:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
is that different on line 22 on page one
 
05:36:56.570 --> 05:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
that someone's gonna
 
05:36:58.610 --> 05:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
issue identification number to your
 
05:36:58.620 --> 05:36:59.628 align:start position:0%
issue identification number to your
point

05:36:59.628 --> 05:36:59.638 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
however if you turn over on page two on
 
05:37:04.970 --> 05:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
line one there's also a patient
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
confidential number
 
05:37:08.090 --> 05:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
who is going to issue that is that going
 
05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
to be the same concern with the patient
 
05:37:12.350 --> 05:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
we have with the provider
 
05:37:13.250 --> 05:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:37:15.288 --> 05:37:15.298 align:start position:0%
representative I don't know that the the
 
05:37:17.510 --> 05:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
patient confidential number would be
 
05:37:20.208 --> 05:37:20.218 align:start position:0%
necessarily something the division would
 
05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
issue it could be something the provider
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
issues or it would be a randomly
 
05:37:26.990 --> 05:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
generated number within the module
 
05:37:27.000 --> 05:37:28.030 align:start position:0%
generated number within the module
itself

05:37:28.030 --> 05:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
itself
 
05:37:31.610 --> 05:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
unless the policy were to try and track
 
05:37:35.090 --> 05:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
the same confidential patient more than
 
05:37:36.470 --> 05:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
once and that would that would need
 
05:37:39.110 --> 05:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
clarification then as well
 
05:37:41.030 --> 05:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
um but to your point about
 
05:37:45.050 --> 05:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
um line 22 on page one that doesn't that
 
05:37:48.530 --> 05:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
just I sets the definition for the
 
05:37:51.770 --> 05:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
health care provider or facility
 
05:37:53.448 --> 05:37:53.458 align:start position:0%
um and doesn't at that point doesn't
 
05:37:55.368 --> 05:37:55.378 align:start position:0%
indicate that we wouldn't be able to
 
05:37:55.378 --> 05:37:57.110 align:start position:0%
indicate that we wouldn't be able to
identify

05:37:57.110 --> 05:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
identify
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:07.310 --> 05:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:12.288 --> 05:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
can you clarify or perhaps maybe just
 
05:38:14.868 --> 05:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
Express a preference because you weren't
 
05:38:17.090 --> 05:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
the drafter of the bill
 
05:38:17.100 --> 05:38:18.530 align:start position:0%
the drafter of the bill
um

05:38:18.530 --> 05:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:18.540 --> 05:38:21.470 align:start position:0%
um
if

05:38:21.470 --> 05:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.610 --> 05:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
if it is if if the
 
05:38:25.620 --> 05:38:27.890 align:start position:0%
if it is if if the
identified

05:38:27.890 --> 05:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
identified
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
data which is linked to a patient name
 
05:38:33.050 --> 05:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
is held
 
05:38:36.050 --> 05:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
at the provider's office
 
05:38:38.330 --> 05:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
then how
 
05:38:40.730 --> 05:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
this may be the same question in a
 
05:38:42.070 --> 05:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
different form
 
05:38:46.128 --> 05:38:46.138 align:start position:0%
how is the patient
 
05:38:51.788 --> 05:38:51.798 align:start position:0%
the patient's individual code going to
 
05:38:56.570 --> 05:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh be generated and indicate where
 
05:38:59.810 --> 05:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
their residences by state city town or
 
05:39:03.948 --> 05:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
County and and if if this is here's what
 
05:39:06.170 --> 05:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
I was really trying to get at if this is
 
05:39:10.368 --> 05:39:10.378 align:start position:0%
generated by the module that resides in
 
05:39:14.590 --> 05:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
Vital Records how does that then not
 
05:39:18.590 --> 05:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
stay linked and therefore not have the
 
05:39:18.600 --> 05:39:20.170 align:start position:0%
stay linked and therefore not have the
confidential

05:39:20.170 --> 05:39:20.180 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
05:39:23.390 --> 05:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that this purported to
 
05:39:23.400 --> 05:39:24.288 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that this purported to
have

05:39:24.288 --> 05:39:24.298 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:39:26.448 --> 05:39:26.458 align:start position:0%
by keeping all of that information at
 
05:39:28.550 --> 05:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
the provider level
 
05:39:29.628 --> 05:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:39:31.610 --> 05:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
representative and I apologize I believe
 
05:39:34.128 --> 05:39:34.138 align:start position:0%
I forgot to introduce myself I'm Erin
 
05:39:36.050 --> 05:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
Hennessey I am the deputy secretary of
 
05:39:37.610 --> 05:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
state and within the Secretary of
 
05:39:39.230 --> 05:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
State's office is the division of Vital
 
05:39:42.230 --> 05:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
Records and archives management so thank
 
05:39:44.990 --> 05:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
you representative um
 
05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
the way I read this bill and I I
 
05:39:49.190 --> 05:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
probably need to spend a lot more time
 
05:39:50.690 --> 05:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
to answer some of the more intricate
 
05:39:54.590 --> 05:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
questions and get with the sponsor but
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
unless to the other Representatives
 
05:40:00.170 --> 05:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
point the policy decision of the house
 
05:40:02.690 --> 05:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
would be to track an individual multiple
 
05:40:02.700 --> 05:40:04.628 align:start position:0%
would be to track an individual multiple
times

05:40:04.628 --> 05:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:40:07.510 --> 05:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
a an individual's
 
05:40:09.890 --> 05:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
confidential number would be much easier
 
05:40:12.890 --> 05:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
to generate with
 
05:40:14.810 --> 05:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
um keeping that patient
 
05:40:16.850 --> 05:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
's name confidential it's not something
 
05:40:20.150 --> 05:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
the division would even need to receive
 
05:40:20.160 --> 05:40:20.990 align:start position:0%
the division would even need to receive
um

05:40:20.990 --> 05:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
with the other information that the
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
provider would Supply
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
but to provide a provider with a
 
05:40:28.010 --> 05:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
confidential number we would have to
 
05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
know who we were providing a
 
05:40:31.730 --> 05:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
confidential information to
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
for the providers
 
05:40:33.360 --> 05:40:34.970 align:start position:0%
for the providers
number

05:40:34.970 --> 05:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
or identifier not necessarily a number
 
05:40:42.110 --> 05:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you that encapsulates my confusion
 
05:40:42.120 --> 05:40:43.610 align:start position:0%
thank you that encapsulates my confusion
well

05:40:43.610 --> 05:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:40:43.620 --> 05:40:45.890 align:start position:0%
well
representative

05:40:45.890 --> 05:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:40:48.470 --> 05:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
05:40:50.570 --> 05:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
answering my question hopefully so I
 
05:40:53.288 --> 05:40:53.298 align:start position:0%
heard you mention concern over line 22
 
05:40:55.250 --> 05:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
identification number for health care
 
05:40:57.590 --> 05:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
providers so my question is currently
 
05:41:01.310 --> 05:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
for any other procedures done here are
 
05:41:04.010 --> 05:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
our health care providers linked with an
 
05:41:05.448 --> 05:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
identification number for other
 
05:41:05.458 --> 05:41:10.128 align:start position:0%
identification number for other
procedures

05:41:10.128 --> 05:41:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:12.650 --> 05:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
I would have to look into that and that
 
05:41:14.270 --> 05:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
might be a question for the Department
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
of of Health and Human Services as well
 
05:41:18.050 --> 05:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
but I would have to get back to you on
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
that question and so follow up follow up
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
um so with that question would be so if
 
05:41:27.410 --> 05:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
if that is a thing that other procedures
 
05:41:29.990 --> 05:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
are linked to that why wouldn't this be
 
05:41:32.570 --> 05:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
05:41:35.090 --> 05:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
 
05:41:35.100 --> 05:41:35.868 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
um

05:41:35.868 --> 05:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:38.510 --> 05:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
our department deals with vital records
 
05:41:40.250 --> 05:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily procedures
 
05:41:43.368 --> 05:41:43.378 align:start position:0%
historically so I would have to find out
 
05:41:44.990 --> 05:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
get with the Department of healthy human
 
05:41:47.090 --> 05:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
services to find out the information for
 
05:41:50.030 --> 05:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.368 --> 05:41:52.378 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber I'm sorry I'll
 
05:41:54.708 --> 05:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:57.110 --> 05:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's really a follow-up to the the prior
 
05:42:00.410 --> 05:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
question would you be willing to provide
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
the committee with more uh information
 
05:42:05.810 --> 05:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
about this proposed module and how it
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
works and what it generates and what it
 
05:42:10.610 --> 05:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
keeps track of just because you would
 
05:42:14.470 --> 05:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
have knowledge of the specific
 
05:42:17.750 --> 05:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
parameters that this module deals with
 
05:42:20.690 --> 05:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
so that we could take a look at what how
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
it actually works in practice thank you
 
05:42:25.128 --> 05:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
05:42:27.050 --> 05:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
question so we
 
05:42:29.930 --> 05:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
um in doing a fiscal note for the bill
 
05:42:32.650 --> 05:42:32.660 align:start position:0%
we we don't actually
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
perform any work to start something
 
05:42:38.750 --> 05:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
before it's past policy wise so
 
05:42:41.570 --> 05:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
um policy wise we would develop the
 
05:42:44.448 --> 05:42:44.458 align:start position:0%
module based on the information that's
 
05:42:47.690 --> 05:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
required for the provider to submit and
 
05:42:49.490 --> 05:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
that would be on page three starting on
 
05:42:51.230 --> 05:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
line 14.
 
05:42:54.350 --> 05:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
Samantha so so my last follow-up is I I
 
05:42:55.970 --> 05:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
was assuming that there was some kind of
 
05:42:57.470 --> 05:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
module that you would purchase off the
 
05:42:59.570 --> 05:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
shelf this would have to be built this
 
05:43:01.788 --> 05:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
following thank you correct thank you
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:06.120 --> 05:43:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%

chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:43:11.040 --> 05:43:12.410 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

05:43:12.410 --> 05:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:43:16.070 --> 05:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of the um the birth
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
worksheets that are completed with every
 
05:43:20.930 --> 05:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
live birth in New Hampshire and they're
 
05:43:23.030 --> 05:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
sent to the Department of Vital Records
 
05:43:23.040 --> 05:43:24.110 align:start position:0%
sent to the Department of Vital Records
yes

05:43:24.110 --> 05:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:43:27.410 --> 05:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
and are you aware that that worksheet
 
05:43:31.128 --> 05:43:31.138 align:start position:0%
asks a lot about procedures and also
 
05:43:34.670 --> 05:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
about birth outcomes live births and
 
05:43:38.090 --> 05:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
other outcomes that could include three
 
05:43:40.550 --> 05:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
possible outcomes which are spontaneous
 
05:43:40.560 --> 05:43:42.530 align:start position:0%
possible outcomes which are spontaneous
abortion

05:43:42.530 --> 05:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:43:42.540 --> 05:43:43.250 align:start position:0%
abortion
um

05:43:43.250 --> 05:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:48.910 --> 05:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:51.890 --> 05:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
ectopic pregnancy are you aware of that
 
05:43:53.230 --> 05:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:43:55.610 --> 05:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
question is asked too
 
05:43:56.628 --> 05:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:43:59.090 --> 05:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
representative I I am aware of the the
 
05:44:00.650 --> 05:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
birth worksheet but I'm not familiar
 
05:44:03.650 --> 05:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
with every single question on it but
 
05:44:05.390 --> 05:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
um I if you're reading from the birth
 
05:44:06.948 --> 05:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
worksheet then I would assume that
 
05:44:10.070 --> 05:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's yes you're correct follow-up
 
05:44:13.490 --> 05:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so knowing that would it is there I
 
05:44:14.750 --> 05:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
assure you
 
05:44:16.368 --> 05:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
um knowing that like would you would you
 
05:44:18.470 --> 05:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
agree that this kind of does still does
 
05:44:20.628 --> 05:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
kind of fall under that same sort of
 
05:44:22.730 --> 05:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
data that that of Department of Vital
 
05:44:25.850 --> 05:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
Records is already collecting
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
but it just it's not this specific but
 
05:44:30.288 --> 05:44:30.298 align:start position:0%
it falls under that kind of umbrella
 
05:44:32.448 --> 05:44:32.458 align:start position:0%
like it's not a random you know how many
 
05:44:34.850 --> 05:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
toes are amputated in New Hampshire when
 
05:44:36.530 --> 05:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
you're not collecting data on on
 
05:44:38.390 --> 05:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
anything like that you know
 
05:44:40.610 --> 05:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
that it is related to data that you're
 
05:44:43.730 --> 05:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
already collecting currently
 
05:44:43.740 --> 05:44:44.930 align:start position:0%
already collecting currently
um

05:44:44.930 --> 05:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:47.270 --> 05:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
um I I see this bill as a policy
 
05:44:51.770 --> 05:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
decision for the legislature to tell us
 
05:44:54.048 --> 05:44:54.058 align:start position:0%
what type of data we would be collecting
 
05:44:58.250 --> 05:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:00.590 --> 05:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
another question yes representative Seth
 
05:45:02.510 --> 05:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:45:03.830 --> 05:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
for coming today
 
05:45:05.570 --> 05:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
I have a really basic question and that
 
05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
is what is what generally does the
 
05:45:09.708 --> 05:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Vital record what do they
 
05:45:12.288 --> 05:45:12.298 align:start position:0%
do what does the vital records do
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
um and is it used strictly for
 
05:45:17.030 --> 05:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislators to gather information to
 
05:45:19.368 --> 05:45:19.378 align:start position:0%
make policy or is it for the general
 
05:45:21.590 --> 05:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
historical record so our and you know
 
05:45:23.390 --> 05:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
our descendants 100 years from now can
 
05:45:25.070 --> 05:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
look back and see I mean what is the
 
05:45:28.610 --> 05:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
point of all this and um to riff a
 
05:45:31.190 --> 05:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
little bit on what representative tell
 
05:45:33.410 --> 05:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
us act asked earlier and I don't think
 
05:45:36.530 --> 05:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
she got really a terribly good answer is
 
05:45:39.470 --> 05:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
um you know how much like do we take do
 
05:45:41.510 --> 05:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
we take records of hysterectomies and
 
05:45:44.690 --> 05:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
vasectomies and things like that and and
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
um you know just I just curious how
 
05:45:50.208 --> 05:45:50.218 align:start position:0%
normal the idea of taking abortions and
 
05:45:51.948 --> 05:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
putting that into Vital Records if
 
05:45:53.990 --> 05:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's is that is that normal for all
 
05:45:55.490 --> 05:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
the all the states in the union or is
 
05:45:57.830 --> 05:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
this somewhat abnormal so it's a lot of
 
05:46:00.110 --> 05:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
questions there sorry but the my first
 
05:46:02.030 --> 05:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
one is the vital records what all do
 
05:46:05.150 --> 05:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
they do and thank you
 
05:46:07.070 --> 05:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your simple
 
05:46:07.080 --> 05:46:10.368 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your simple
question

05:46:10.368 --> 05:46:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:11.868 --> 05:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
um so I think that the Department of
 
05:46:13.368 --> 05:46:13.378 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services will tell you
 
05:46:15.368 --> 05:46:15.378 align:start position:0%
that the division of Vital Records is
 
05:46:17.868 --> 05:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
would traditionally be in a Department
 
05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services in other
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
states but for the mission of our
 
05:46:24.650 --> 05:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records in New
 
05:46:27.350 --> 05:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it was a policy decision to
 
05:46:30.048 --> 05:46:30.058 align:start position:0%
move it to within the department of
 
05:46:31.970 --> 05:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
secretary the Secretary of State and the
 
05:46:33.530 --> 05:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
Department of State
 
05:46:35.570 --> 05:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
um and so we
 
05:46:37.730 --> 05:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
um as a division and I apologize I'm not
 
05:46:41.208 --> 05:46:41.218 align:start position:0%
an expert on Vital Records yet we
 
05:46:44.150 --> 05:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
collect information on births deaths
 
05:46:48.350 --> 05:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
marriages annulments adoptions and
 
05:46:50.570 --> 05:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
process the vital records associated
 
05:46:52.430 --> 05:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
with that so birth certificates death
 
05:46:52.440 --> 05:46:54.650 align:start position:0%
with that so birth certificates death
certificates

05:46:54.650 --> 05:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
05:46:54.660 --> 05:46:55.670 align:start position:0%
certificates
um

05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:58.610 --> 05:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
marriage certificates and we have a very
 
05:47:00.530 --> 05:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
close working relationship with
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
providers that
 
05:47:05.090 --> 05:47:05.100 align:start position:0%

chairman

05:48:43.750 --> 05:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:48:48.170 --> 05:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
so representative Jess Edwards just
 
05:48:51.830 --> 05:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31. the reason I'm I
 
05:48:54.530 --> 05:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
decided to say something is because I've
 
05:48:56.330 --> 05:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
been kicking around in this field for
 
05:48:59.930 --> 05:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
about six years and one and I've I've
 
05:49:03.048 --> 05:49:03.058 align:start position:0%
been in this conversation many times and
 
05:49:05.390 --> 05:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
one thing that I now know that I didn't
 
05:49:08.510 --> 05:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
know that you may want to know is is
 
05:49:13.010 --> 05:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
that once once the data gets into Vital
 
05:49:17.690 --> 05:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
Records uh there is a vital records
 
05:49:22.070 --> 05:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
privacy board that reviews uh very
 
05:49:24.610 --> 05:49:24.620 align:start position:0%
detailed and very formal applications
 
05:49:28.090 --> 05:49:28.100 align:start position:0%
for clinical research to be done on that
 
05:49:32.230 --> 05:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
data and and so this board
 
05:49:36.048 --> 05:49:36.058 align:start position:0%
goes ahead and reviews it all and
 
05:49:38.270 --> 05:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
determines whether or not there's
 
05:49:40.850 --> 05:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
clinical utility in the research and
 
05:49:42.948 --> 05:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
whether or not that there's sufficient
 
05:49:46.010 --> 05:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
privacy safeguards so that we can
 
05:49:50.570 --> 05:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
protect our citizens anonymity and and I
 
05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
know this now because as of one November
 
05:49:54.530 --> 05:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
I was appointed by the Secretary of
 
05:49:55.970 --> 05:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
State on that board and I've gone
 
05:49:57.470 --> 05:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
through a few meetings I've reviewed
 
05:50:00.350 --> 05:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
about 10 of these packages and we've
 
05:50:02.270 --> 05:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
kicked them back if they're not if
 
05:50:05.150 --> 05:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're not good enough we we refuse to
 
05:50:08.750 --> 05:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
let the data go until we're convinced
 
05:50:11.208 --> 05:50:11.218 align:start position:0%
that you know there's clinical utility
 
05:50:14.470 --> 05:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's got good scope that there's
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
a safe the safeguards for privacy are
 
05:50:20.930 --> 05:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
assured so the vital records privacy
 
05:50:24.048 --> 05:50:24.058 align:start position:0%
board is critical to this and as as an
 
05:50:24.058 --> 05:50:26.090 align:start position:0%
board is critical to this and as as an
aside

05:50:26.090 --> 05:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
aside
 
05:50:28.368 --> 05:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
um uh though there's going to be a bill
 
05:50:30.770 --> 05:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
kicking around there there had been a a
 
05:50:35.048 --> 05:50:35.058 align:start position:0%
committee that Senator Cindy Rosenwald
 
05:50:38.990 --> 05:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh LED where we took a look and reviewed
 
05:50:43.430 --> 05:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
the uh live birth worksheet and uh we
 
05:50:45.890 --> 05:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
have recommended some changes to that to
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
segregate which data is mandatory and
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
subject to felony and which of it is
 
05:50:54.110 --> 05:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
optional all of it had been subject to
 
05:50:57.110 --> 05:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
felony charges for false information so
 
05:51:00.250 --> 05:51:00.260 align:start position:0%
we we fixed that and that live birth
 
05:51:04.910 --> 05:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
worksheet is for live births and and it
 
05:51:07.190 --> 05:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
didn't it didn't necessarily come up in
 
05:51:09.048 --> 05:51:09.058 align:start position:0%
the discussion but as I was thinking
 
05:51:12.350 --> 05:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
through it listening to testimony I I
 
05:51:14.390 --> 05:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
came to the conclusion of the Assumption
 
05:51:18.470 --> 05:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
rather that that live birth statistic
 
05:51:21.230 --> 05:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
worksheet would not be completed for an
 
05:51:21.240 --> 05:51:22.490 align:start position:0%
worksheet would not be completed for an
abortion

05:51:22.490 --> 05:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:51:25.010 --> 05:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
so so right now there is none of that
 
05:51:26.990 --> 05:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
data in the vital records database
 
05:51:30.770 --> 05:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
there's no form to get it in there so
 
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
um that's that's what I think I know
 
05:51:36.770 --> 05:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Edwards yes
 
05:51:40.368 --> 05:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
would you believe as another person who
 
05:51:43.368 --> 05:51:43.378 align:start position:0%
worked on the live birth worksheet that
 
05:51:46.368 --> 05:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Vital Statistics doesn't
 
05:51:55.070 --> 05:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:57.770 --> 05:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
because we sat next to each other I I I
 
05:52:02.030 --> 05:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
think I think I recall that uh but but
 
05:52:06.410 --> 05:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
I'm also very confident that all of the
 
05:52:10.330 --> 05:52:10.340 align:start position:0%
requirements of HIPAA from a
 
05:52:13.610 --> 05:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
security perspective and from a privacy
 
05:52:17.208 --> 05:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
perspective are are built into the whole
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
Vital Records database and the processes
 
05:52:24.708 --> 05:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
around it so although it itself is not a
 
05:52:27.770 --> 05:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
subject to HIPAA it is certainly subject
 
05:52:30.948 --> 05:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
to intense scrutiny from a security and
 
05:52:33.048 --> 05:52:33.058 align:start position:0%
privacy perspective I believe that's
 
05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
fair from what we heard thank you I just
 
05:52:36.410 --> 05:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
thought that was is good for the
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
committee to know because it certainly
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
came up
 
05:52:42.410 --> 05:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
during our committee deliberations right
 
05:52:45.410 --> 05:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
and I and I think I also heard that that
 
05:52:47.270 --> 05:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
it needed to go to vital records and not
 
05:52:49.548 --> 05:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
DHHS because somebody raised a
 
05:52:51.350 --> 05:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue within the New
 
05:52:52.730 --> 05:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution I don't know if
 
05:52:55.610 --> 05:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
that's true or not but but that that's
 
05:52:55.620 --> 05:52:56.470 align:start position:0%
that's true or not but but that that's
another

05:52:56.470 --> 05:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:52:58.850 --> 05:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
factoid representative that would be
 
05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
good to know when we have the executive
 
05:53:02.570 --> 05:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
session on this bill also thank you
 
05:53:04.010 --> 05:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for
 
05:53:07.490 --> 05:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:11.090 --> 05:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:14.570 --> 05:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
I have copyrighted in the oven on sp91
 
05:53:16.490 --> 05:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:53:18.770 --> 05:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
okay next sign up to testify is Sarah
 
05:53:38.150 --> 05:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:39.830 --> 05:53:39.840 align:start position:0%

non-partisan League of Women Voters of
 
05:53:52.670 --> 05:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire

birth control and abortions
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in opposition to House
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 582 requiring the New Hampshire
 
05:54:16.128 --> 05:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records to collect
 
05:54:18.770 --> 05:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
statistics pertaining to induced
 
05:54:21.830 --> 05:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
termination of pregnancy
 
05:54:25.788 --> 05:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
just three days ago on January 22nd
 
05:54:28.250 --> 05:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
we should have been celebrating the 50th
 
05:54:33.288 --> 05:54:33.298 align:start position:0%
anniversary of Roe versus Wade a 7-2 U.S
 
05:54:35.810 --> 05:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision protecting
 
05:54:38.208 --> 05:54:38.218 align:start position:0%
women's Reproductive Rights
 
05:54:41.570 --> 05:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
instead we are here once again facing
 
05:54:44.150 --> 05:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
another bill that continues to chip away
 
05:54:47.150 --> 05:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
at women's right to choose which she
 
05:54:49.368 --> 05:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
believes is best for herself and her
 
05:54:49.378 --> 05:54:51.170 align:start position:0%
believes is best for herself and her
family

05:54:51.170 --> 05:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:54:53.330 --> 05:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
under the statement of purpose as
 
05:54:56.030 --> 05:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
written for HB 582
 
05:55:00.350 --> 05:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
it states quote the general court also
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
finds that the collection of statistical
 
05:55:05.470 --> 05:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
data regarding termination of pregnancy
 
05:55:08.270 --> 05:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
is essential to the state's compelling
 
05:55:11.330 --> 05:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
interest in the life and health of its
 
05:55:14.810 --> 05:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
citizens including the pre-born
 
05:55:14.820 --> 05:55:17.150 align:start position:0%
citizens including the pre-born
unquote

05:55:17.150 --> 05:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
05:55:19.570 --> 05:55:19.580 align:start position:0%
we asked this committee
 
05:55:24.128 --> 05:55:24.138 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly how are these statistics
 
05:55:26.690 --> 05:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
essential to the well-being of our
 
05:55:26.700 --> 05:55:28.310 align:start position:0%
essential to the well-being of our
citizens

05:55:28.310 --> 05:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
05:55:31.730 --> 05:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
have any of the sponsors of this bill
 
05:55:34.850 --> 05:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
researched other states to see how they
 
05:55:38.330 --> 05:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
have utilized the data they collected
 
05:55:41.570 --> 05:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
and if any of those statistics improve
 
05:55:42.770 --> 05:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
the care
 
05:55:46.190 --> 05:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
of women's reproductive health
 
05:55:48.830 --> 05:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
the statement of purpose also includes
 
05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
the word quote pre-born unquote
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know this word is
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
closely associated with organizations
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
who strongly oppose a woman's right to
 
05:56:02.878 --> 05:56:03.770 align:start position:0%
who strongly oppose a woman's right to
choose

05:56:03.770 --> 05:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
choose
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
it should not be part of the purpose of
 
05:56:09.890 --> 05:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
in addition HB 582 does not provide us
 
05:56:16.490 --> 05:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
with the list of abortion statistics
 
05:56:20.208 --> 05:56:20.218 align:start position:0%
that the state wishes to obtain
 
05:56:22.930 --> 05:56:22.940 align:start position:0%
I wanted to reference
 
05:56:28.628 --> 05:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
what was mentioned earlier on page three
 
05:56:31.850 --> 05:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
of this it seemed to be a cut and paste
 
05:56:34.970 --> 05:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
from the CDC data requirements
 
05:56:37.730 --> 05:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
and it goes from one all the way down to
 
05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:45.948 --> 05:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
so these are these are things that my
 
05:56:48.470 --> 05:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
understanding could be questions that
 
05:56:54.470 --> 05:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:57.830 --> 05:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
I also reviewed a number of CDC websites
 
05:57:00.350 --> 05:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
over the years because as we all know by
 
05:57:02.090 --> 05:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
now they have been collecting data and
 
05:57:03.770 --> 05:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
other institutions have been collecting
 
05:57:05.690 --> 05:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
data on this you can start wrapping up
 
05:57:07.910 --> 05:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
ma'am here we have over here three
 
05:57:09.920 --> 05:57:09.930 align:start position:0%
minutes well I'm sorry
 
05:57:09.930 --> 05:57:10.310 align:start position:0%
minutes well I'm sorry
[Music]

05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:57:10.320 --> 05:57:11.510 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:14.810 --> 05:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
so including some very personal ones and
 
05:57:17.090 --> 05:57:17.100 align:start position:0%
a woman on the day of the abortion would
 
05:57:18.708 --> 05:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
likely be the time she would have to
 
05:57:21.350 --> 05:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
answer these questions and I want to
 
05:57:23.990 --> 05:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
just try for a moment to put yourself in
 
05:57:26.208 --> 05:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
the place of that woman and ask
 
05:57:27.890 --> 05:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
yourselves whether there is any
 
05:57:29.810 --> 05:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
situation in which a man would be
 
05:57:32.750 --> 05:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
required to answer such questions as are
 
05:57:35.150 --> 05:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
you married have you had other abortions
 
05:57:37.070 --> 05:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
were you using birth control measures
 
05:57:39.530 --> 05:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
when you got pregnant how many children
 
05:57:41.868 --> 05:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
do you already have what about your
 
05:57:44.448 --> 05:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
financial situation and why are you
 
05:57:47.090 --> 05:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
choosing an abortion today
 
05:57:49.490 --> 05:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
after a health care worker has asked and
 
05:57:51.470 --> 05:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
recorded the answer is that person will
 
05:57:53.208 --> 05:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
now be responsible for ensuring the
 
05:57:55.128 --> 05:57:55.138 align:start position:0%
confidential results are documented on
 
05:57:58.310 --> 05:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
the proper form and sent to CDC or
 
05:58:00.288 --> 05:58:00.298 align:start position:0%
whatever other organizations the state
 
05:58:02.750 --> 05:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
chooses we all know that health care
 
05:58:05.150 --> 05:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
workers in New Hampshire as else as
 
05:58:07.548 --> 05:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
elsewhere are stretched to the Limit and
 
05:58:09.410 --> 05:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
do not need to spend more time on this
 
05:58:11.930 --> 05:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
type of paperwork okay ma'am please wrap
 
05:58:15.350 --> 05:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
up okay I have one short paragraph
 
05:58:18.590 --> 05:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
okay about the fiscal note of 25
 
05:58:21.170 --> 05:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
000 to 50 000 and according to the
 
05:58:22.910 --> 05:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
methodology paragraph because I believe
 
05:58:24.470 --> 05:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
one of your representatives asked about
 
05:58:28.010 --> 05:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
this it's in the methodology paragraph
 
05:58:30.170 --> 05:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
that a new module have to be designed
 
05:58:33.048 --> 05:58:33.058 align:start position:0%
built and tested in addition education
 
05:58:34.910 --> 05:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
program from Health Care Providers would
 
05:58:37.250 --> 05:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
need to be developed and then deploy to
 
05:58:39.470 --> 05:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
an unknown number of providers in a
 
05:58:42.230 --> 05:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
variety of Health Care settings periodic
 
05:58:44.448 --> 05:58:44.458 align:start position:0%
analysis and annual reports of this data
 
05:58:46.730 --> 05:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
would also be needed and needed to be
 
05:58:48.830 --> 05:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
submitted once again to unknown
 
05:58:51.948 --> 05:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
organizations furthermore the note does
 
05:58:53.868 --> 05:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
not include as we mentioned earlier the
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire division of Vital Records
 
05:58:57.830 --> 05:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
who already is keeping track of birth
 
05:59:00.948 --> 05:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
marriages divorces adoptions and deaths
 
05:59:03.350 --> 05:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
so in closing I go back to my original
 
05:59:05.448 --> 05:59:05.458 align:start position:0%
questions about this bill
 
05:59:08.448 --> 05:59:08.458 align:start position:0%
why is this bill needed and in what ways
 
05:59:11.150 --> 05:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
could the findings be essential to the
 
05:59:14.448 --> 05:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
well-being of our citizens I thank you
 
05:59:16.610 --> 05:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
for your time and your consideration of
 
05:59:18.530 --> 05:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
my comments thank you ma'am questions
 
05:59:20.810 --> 05:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:59:22.548 --> 05:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:59:22.558 --> 05:59:23.930 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:59:23.930 --> 05:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:59:23.940 --> 05:59:24.890 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:59:24.890 --> 05:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:27.890 --> 05:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
have you in your own relationships with
 
05:59:29.990 --> 05:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
your medical providers ever been asked
 
05:59:32.090 --> 05:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
to provide your educational level before
 
05:59:34.368 --> 05:59:34.378 align:start position:0%
a treatment or a procedure was done to
 
05:59:34.378 --> 05:59:36.590 align:start position:0%
a treatment or a procedure was done to
you

05:59:36.590 --> 05:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:39.048 --> 05:59:39.058 align:start position:0%
I have never had an abortion
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
I know that you're not asking that
 
05:59:42.650 --> 05:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
directly and I know I don't have to say
 
05:59:45.590 --> 05:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
that but I'm not uh but I have had other
 
05:59:48.170 --> 05:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh procedures but I've never been asked
 
05:59:50.628 --> 05:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
the questions that are on here about
 
05:59:53.330 --> 05:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
personal relationships about how my
 
05:59:56.030 --> 05:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
educational level about my financial
 
05:59:56.040 --> 05:59:58.368 align:start position:0%
educational level about my financial
situation

05:59:58.368 --> 05:59:58.378 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing I think these
 
06:00:02.448 --> 06:00:02.458 align:start position:0%
extremely personal things that no person
 
06:00:06.288 --> 06:00:06.298 align:start position:0%
should be asked to answer in addition
 
06:00:09.830 --> 06:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
it the provider certainly can record
 
06:00:12.530 --> 06:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
the date of birth the fact that an
 
06:00:14.530 --> 06:00:14.540 align:start position:0%
abortion occurred and how many weeks
 
06:00:17.810 --> 06:00:17.820 align:start position:0%
those are facts but many of these other
 
06:00:20.208 --> 06:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
things how accurate is that data going
 
06:00:22.548 --> 06:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
to be represented from a woman who is
 
06:00:24.650 --> 06:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
very nervous to start with I just
 
06:00:26.330 --> 06:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
questioned the accuracy of some of the
 
06:00:29.208 --> 06:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
other data I think it might be asked uh
 
06:00:31.788 --> 06:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you thank you
 
06:00:33.590 --> 06:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:00:36.890 --> 06:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
um so I heard you mention and correct me
 
06:00:39.650 --> 06:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong that
 
06:00:42.288 --> 06:00:42.298 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:00:44.570 --> 06:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
um basically takes is a
 
06:00:47.990 --> 06:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
ffecting a woman's right to choose
 
06:00:50.990 --> 06:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
um but I'm wondering how collecting just
 
06:00:54.048 --> 06:00:54.058 align:start position:0%
statistics of the numbers that we're
 
06:00:56.030 --> 06:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
talking about not the who's the numbers
 
06:00:58.910 --> 06:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
how that in itself would take away a
 
06:01:00.410 --> 06:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
woman's right to choose how does that
 
06:01:02.270 --> 06:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
affect that I don't have a problem with
 
06:01:03.948 --> 06:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
the actual facts as I just mentioned
 
06:01:06.590 --> 06:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
those very clear on the date of birth of
 
06:01:08.510 --> 06:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
the person perhaps although I don't even
 
06:01:10.368 --> 06:01:10.378 align:start position:0%
think that's necessary the number of
 
06:01:12.948 --> 06:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
weeks along the type of procedure that
 
06:01:15.708 --> 06:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
was performed but
 
06:01:18.590 --> 06:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
it is it's this has just been one of
 
06:01:20.570 --> 06:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
many many bills that have come up in the
 
06:01:22.910 --> 06:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
last number of six eight years in New
 
06:01:22.920 --> 06:01:23.930 align:start position:0%
last number of six eight years in New
Hampshire

06:01:23.930 --> 06:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:01:26.868 --> 06:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
some of them have really impounded upon
 
06:01:29.150 --> 06:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh the women's right to choose it makes
 
06:01:31.070 --> 06:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
it more and more difficult not
 
06:01:33.170 --> 06:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to speak up
 
06:01:35.990 --> 06:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
many of these women are you know are
 
06:01:38.948 --> 06:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
very scared to start with and it's just
 
06:01:41.690 --> 06:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
nibbling away chipping away at the
 
06:01:45.288 --> 06:01:45.298 align:start position:0%
women's right that was 50 years ago
 
06:01:47.208 --> 06:01:47.218 align:start position:0%
it's important we focus on this bill
 
06:01:48.890 --> 06:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
though not the other groups follow up
 
06:01:52.670 --> 06:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
please follow up yeah so I mentioned it
 
06:01:54.830 --> 06:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
again that it's I hear what you're
 
06:01:57.350 --> 06:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
saying but this bill we just want to
 
06:01:59.390 --> 06:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
know the numbers that we're dealing with
 
06:02:02.330 --> 06:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
so I know when I was canvassing for my
 
06:02:04.730 --> 06:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
election this past time that one the
 
06:02:07.310 --> 06:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
number one topic was this and so many
 
06:02:09.708 --> 06:02:09.718 align:start position:0%
questions were asked of me about it and
 
06:02:12.650 --> 06:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
I had no idea how to answer them so and
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
and they were throwing stats at me that
 
06:02:18.110 --> 06:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
well this do you know how many people
 
06:02:20.030 --> 06:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
um died during childbirth and this and
 
06:02:23.090 --> 06:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
that but there was no other stats that I
 
06:02:25.610 --> 06:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
could in turn so I'm I'm I get so again
 
06:02:28.730 --> 06:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
it's I I hear your concern but I've got
 
06:02:30.770 --> 06:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
a question yeah it's I I'm gonna go back
 
06:02:32.510 --> 06:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
to because I don't think you really
 
06:02:35.270 --> 06:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
answered it is how is this bill the way
 
06:02:37.850 --> 06:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
it's written right now taking away a
 
06:02:40.010 --> 06:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
woman's right to choose with all due
 
06:02:42.590 --> 06:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
respect I go back to what is listed this
 
06:02:44.810 --> 06:02:44.820 align:start position:0%
cotton paste area if I knew what the
 
06:02:47.390 --> 06:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
questions were but right now it's a
 
06:02:50.030 --> 06:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
whole potpourri of many many questions
 
06:02:52.730 --> 06:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
many of them are personal that would
 
06:02:54.830 --> 06:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
make a decision a woman would say I
 
06:02:56.208 --> 06:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
don't want to put myself in that
 
06:02:58.368 --> 06:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
position to have to answer all those
 
06:03:00.948 --> 06:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
questions if there was a list of
 
06:03:03.890 --> 06:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
specific questions in this bill I might
 
06:03:05.628 --> 06:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
feel very differently about it but it's
 
06:03:06.948 --> 06:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
not in here
 
06:03:09.048 --> 06:03:09.058 align:start position:0%
why don't we move on then any other
 
06:03:09.058 --> 06:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
why don't we move on then any other
questions

06:03:11.270 --> 06:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you for taking
 
06:03:16.368 --> 06:03:16.378 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:03:19.190 --> 06:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry in your last paragraph you
 
06:03:21.310 --> 06:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
enumerated a number of different
 
06:03:23.930 --> 06:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
processes that need to happen for this
 
06:03:25.970 --> 06:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
to actually be operationalized and so
 
06:03:28.490 --> 06:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
were you suggesting that the estimate of
 
06:03:30.770 --> 06:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
25 000 or whatever the number is is a
 
06:03:33.650 --> 06:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
gross under count I
 
06:03:36.048 --> 06:03:36.058 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying is from 25
 
06:03:39.170 --> 06:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
000 to 50 000. there seems to be an
 
06:03:41.270 --> 06:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
awful lot of data that awful lot of
 
06:03:43.128 --> 06:03:43.138 align:start position:0%
things that need to be accomplished just
 
06:03:46.788 --> 06:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
designing and implementing a new module
 
06:03:48.590 --> 06:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
that's not just downloaded from the
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
computer that by itself is huge
 
06:03:53.270 --> 06:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
educating all the providers these are
 
06:03:56.150 --> 06:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
not just freestanding so-called abortion
 
06:03:57.590 --> 06:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
clinics this would be every hospital
 
06:04:00.890 --> 06:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
every doctor's office every Outpatient
 
06:04:00.900 --> 06:04:02.110 align:start position:0%
every doctor's office every Outpatient
Clinic

06:04:02.110 --> 06:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
Clinic
 
06:04:05.030 --> 06:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire would have
 
06:04:07.628 --> 06:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
to be tapped to see if the those
 
06:04:10.010 --> 06:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
providers need to be educated in this
 
06:04:12.730 --> 06:04:12.740 align:start position:0%
new module so it's quite far-reaching
 
06:04:15.470 --> 06:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
and you know once again as it's
 
06:04:16.970 --> 06:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned today what I've heard so far
 
06:04:20.030 --> 06:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
is the numbers are still being um
 
06:04:20.040 --> 06:04:20.750 align:start position:0%
is the numbers are still being um
um

06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:24.048 --> 06:04:24.058 align:start position:0%
they haven't been settled yet that's not
 
06:04:25.610 --> 06:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
quite sure what they are
 
06:04:30.410 --> 06:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:32.628 --> 06:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
06:04:35.390 --> 06:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
06:04:37.368 --> 06:04:37.378 align:start position:0%
it gets back into I think one of the
 
06:04:38.570 --> 06:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
things we talked about earlier this
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
morning and it gets back into the
 
06:04:41.270 --> 06:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
Privacy issue and I think what I
 
06:04:43.670 --> 06:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
understand there's the issue of
 
06:04:45.230 --> 06:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
what we want to protect and how we
 
06:04:46.490 --> 06:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
protect it
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that once you start
 
06:04:50.090 --> 06:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
aggregating data in any kind of a
 
06:04:50.100 --> 06:04:51.350 align:start position:0%
aggregating data in any kind of a
database

06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
database
 
06:04:53.090 --> 06:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
do you have any concern about it being
 
06:04:54.830 --> 06:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
breached and then at that point in time
 
06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
once it's breached it all this I mean
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
there's so much personal information in
 
06:05:00.890 --> 06:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
here do you concern yourself with this
 
06:05:02.930 --> 06:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly concerned I think we all
 
06:05:05.150 --> 06:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
are in today's world with credit cards
 
06:05:07.430 --> 06:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
and every day we hear about somebody's
 
06:05:10.730 --> 06:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
uh identity is being stolen for sure and
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
I do Echo what others had mentioned
 
06:05:15.708 --> 06:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
about if you give a personal ID to the
 
06:05:18.470 --> 06:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
provider and then another personal idea
 
06:05:20.330 --> 06:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
to the patient
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to be keeping that data
 
06:05:25.010 --> 06:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
and there's a turnover all the time and
 
06:05:26.150 --> 06:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's going to be the data is
 
06:05:27.708 --> 06:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
going to be kept at the at the
 
06:05:30.650 --> 06:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
provider's offices or hospitals
 
06:05:32.570 --> 06:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
there's such a turnover all the time
 
06:05:34.010 --> 06:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
who's going to be the keeper of the key
 
06:05:36.110 --> 06:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
so I am concerned with that confidential
 
06:05:38.448 --> 06:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
data to start with I'm not really sure
 
06:05:39.708 --> 06:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
why we need
 
06:05:43.010 --> 06:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
the patient's name at all I can on the
 
06:05:44.510 --> 06:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
other hand understand why we might want
 
06:05:46.610 --> 06:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
to have a provider's name
 
06:05:50.448 --> 06:05:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:51.890 --> 06:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay I think we're all set thank you
 
06:05:54.350 --> 06:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you I have uh copies of my
 
06:05:56.090 --> 06:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
testimony okay I could bring them
 
06:05:57.170 --> 06:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
forward and give them to the Clark
 
06:05:57.180 --> 06:05:58.490 align:start position:0%
forward and give them to the Clark
please

06:05:58.490 --> 06:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
please
 
06:06:00.770 --> 06:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
okay I also signed up to speak today on
 
06:06:03.288 --> 06:06:03.298 align:start position:0%
this on this bill is Kurt welper from
 
06:06:12.110 --> 06:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:14.150 --> 06:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
06:06:15.890 --> 06:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Kurt
 
06:06:18.590 --> 06:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
welper I am vice president of New
 
06:06:20.570 --> 06:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right to life and I'm here
 
06:06:24.410 --> 06:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
representing them as we represent all
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:33.170 --> 06:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.670 --> 06:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
I've heard so many I want to answer some
 
06:06:35.868 --> 06:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
questions and so that's what I'm going
 
06:06:37.310 --> 06:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
to do
 
06:06:40.970 --> 06:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
right we need this data why
 
06:06:43.788 --> 06:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
the same reason
 
06:06:46.250 --> 06:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
the same reason that department of idle
 
06:06:46.260 --> 06:06:47.570 align:start position:0%
the same reason that department of idle
statistics

06:06:47.570 --> 06:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
06:06:49.850 --> 06:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
keeps track of death
 
06:06:49.860 --> 06:06:51.470 align:start position:0%
keeps track of death
because

06:06:51.470 --> 06:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:06:53.930 --> 06:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
the reason for this bill
 
06:06:55.850 --> 06:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
Above All Else
 
06:06:58.128 --> 06:06:58.138 align:start position:0%
is that we are not talking about a
 
06:07:00.048 --> 06:07:00.058 align:start position:0%
health procedure
 
06:07:03.470 --> 06:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
we are talking about a death procedure
 
06:07:07.670 --> 06:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:10.548 --> 06:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
results in the death
 
06:07:13.970 --> 06:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
of a living human being
 
06:07:16.430 --> 06:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
a living human being with the
 
06:07:19.850 --> 06:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
fundamental inalienable not separable
 
06:07:21.850 --> 06:07:21.860 align:start position:0%
from their own physical being
 
06:07:25.368 --> 06:07:25.378 align:start position:0%
inalienable right to life
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we need this data
 
06:07:30.048 --> 06:07:30.058 align:start position:0%
because the best data that I've seen and
 
06:07:32.208 --> 06:07:32.218 align:start position:0%
I've seen a lot in the years that I've
 
06:07:34.430 --> 06:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
been working on this
 
06:07:36.048 --> 06:07:36.058 align:start position:0%
there were roughly three to four
 
06:07:37.730 --> 06:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
thousand abortions performed in our
 
06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
state every year
 
06:07:41.930 --> 06:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
everyone knows including guttmacher Who
 
06:07:44.510 --> 06:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
provided that number
 
06:07:46.850 --> 06:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
that isn't right
 
06:07:48.288 --> 06:07:48.298 align:start position:0%
because all they get is what's
 
06:07:51.170 --> 06:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
voluntarily reported to them
 
06:07:55.610 --> 06:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:58.128 --> 06:07:58.138 align:start position:0%
would we allow any other
 
06:08:00.170 --> 06:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
procedure to go forward in our state
 
06:08:02.628 --> 06:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
that knowingly
 
06:08:05.628 --> 06:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
killed three to four thousand people in
 
06:08:08.448 --> 06:08:08.458 align:start position:0%
our state and maybe more
 
06:08:10.310 --> 06:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
I don't think so
 
06:08:12.650 --> 06:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
I think we will all know who did it
 
06:08:15.948 --> 06:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:18.530 --> 06:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
we have a whole range of crimes and
 
06:08:20.690 --> 06:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
other sections of our law
 
06:08:22.430 --> 06:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
the pre-born
 
06:08:26.868 --> 06:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
are treated as people with rights
 
06:08:32.090 --> 06:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:37.670 --> 06:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:39.770 --> 06:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
it's treated just like a human being
 
06:08:42.110 --> 06:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
just like everybody else
 
06:08:45.350 --> 06:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
why aren't these particular class of
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
human beings
 
06:08:50.868 --> 06:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:53.330 --> 06:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
that's why we need this bill it's in the
 
06:08:54.770 --> 06:08:54.780 align:start position:0%
absolute right place the Department of
 
06:08:56.510 --> 06:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
Vital Statistics because it's tracking
 
06:08:56.520 --> 06:08:58.128 align:start position:0%
Vital Statistics because it's tracking
deaths

06:08:58.128 --> 06:08:58.138 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
06:09:00.770 --> 06:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
those just may not have names
 
06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
but they're still people
 
06:09:07.850 --> 06:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:10.610 --> 06:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
the question of privacy has been
 
06:09:13.548 --> 06:09:13.558 align:start position:0%
addressed in this bill several times in
 
06:09:15.288 --> 06:09:15.298 align:start position:0%
the past couple years in the past five
 
06:09:17.448 --> 06:09:17.458 align:start position:0%
years I know
 
06:09:20.030 --> 06:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
and it's been beaten to death
 
06:09:22.670 --> 06:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
as you've heard earlier testimony you
 
06:09:24.470 --> 06:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
have to have some way
 
06:09:26.390 --> 06:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
of tracking
 
06:09:29.810 --> 06:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
where and these things occur
 
06:09:31.610 --> 06:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
and who's doing them
 
06:09:34.070 --> 06:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
you just have to because whatever you
 
06:09:37.070 --> 06:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
get useless thank you Mr Wilber yes
 
06:09:39.110 --> 06:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
06:09:40.610 --> 06:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:09:42.530 --> 06:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative welper
 
06:09:46.208 --> 06:09:46.218 align:start position:0%
um the the ethical question aside of
 
06:09:49.910 --> 06:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
some people say that it's not a life at
 
06:09:51.530 --> 06:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
a certain point and some people say that
 
06:09:53.628 --> 06:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
it is and there's that debate but
 
06:09:56.770 --> 06:09:56.780 align:start position:0%
putting that aside would you agree that
 
06:10:00.610 --> 06:10:00.620 align:start position:0%
knowing where the rates of abortion are
 
06:10:03.948 --> 06:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
in our state can be an indicator of the
 
06:10:05.470 --> 06:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
health of our population
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
and seeing how they're trending with
 
06:10:12.170 --> 06:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
changes in the economy and you know as
 
06:10:14.690 --> 06:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
we see demographic changes don't you
 
06:10:17.110 --> 06:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
think that that would be a valuable
 
06:10:21.590 --> 06:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
piece of data for us to have just to
 
06:10:26.690 --> 06:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
understand how abortion numbers respond
 
06:10:30.470 --> 06:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:33.470 --> 06:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
yes I'm going to just say yes because I
 
06:10:34.970 --> 06:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
don't want to go longer
 
06:10:37.970 --> 06:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:40.610 --> 06:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
um yes representative thank you Mr
 
06:10:40.620 --> 06:10:42.048 align:start position:0%
um yes representative thank you Mr
chairman

06:10:42.048 --> 06:10:42.058 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:10:43.910 --> 06:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
um so according
 
06:10:46.128 --> 06:10:46.138 align:start position:0%
to your position
 
06:10:49.250 --> 06:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
um an abortion is a death and therefore
 
06:10:51.170 --> 06:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
it should be recorded
 
06:10:53.510 --> 06:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
but is it not also true that all
 
06:10:56.090 --> 06:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
miscarriages are also by your definition
 
06:10:59.030 --> 06:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
of death and should they all be recorded
 
06:11:01.788 --> 06:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
as well thank you no
 
06:11:06.230 --> 06:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
yes and no so yes a miscarriage is also
 
06:11:07.368 --> 06:11:07.378 align:start position:0%
a death
 
06:11:10.610 --> 06:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
what it is not is intentional
 
06:11:12.350 --> 06:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
and so it would not fall under the
 
06:11:16.250 --> 06:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:19.670 --> 06:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:22.070 --> 06:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:11:24.170 --> 06:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative for
 
06:11:27.048 --> 06:11:27.058 align:start position:0%
being so forthcoming and direct and
 
06:11:27.058 --> 06:11:28.250 align:start position:0%
being so forthcoming and direct and
honest

06:11:28.250 --> 06:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
honest
 
06:11:31.190 --> 06:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
um an earlier representative who
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
testified said acknowledged that there
 
06:11:36.350 --> 06:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
was no need to have these statistics for
 
06:11:38.510 --> 06:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
clinical purposes
 
06:11:38.520 --> 06:11:39.170 align:start position:0%
clinical purposes
um

06:11:39.170 --> 06:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:42.230 --> 06:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know clinical medical purposes but
 
06:11:44.448 --> 06:11:44.458 align:start position:0%
that they but having these statistics
 
06:11:47.868 --> 06:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
would inform policy decisions that
 
06:11:50.390 --> 06:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
Representatives have to make
 
06:11:53.208 --> 06:11:53.218 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
06:11:55.730 --> 06:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
had these statistics available to you it
 
06:11:57.288 --> 06:11:57.298 align:start position:0%
seems sounds like you have some
 
06:11:59.690 --> 06:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
estimates of what's going on already but
 
06:12:02.510 --> 06:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
if you had more specific statistics
 
06:12:04.250 --> 06:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
available to you
 
06:12:08.390 --> 06:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
how would it inform your policy ideas
 
06:12:10.430 --> 06:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
well let's just suppose for the sake of
 
06:12:12.590 --> 06:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
argument that all of these things
 
06:12:16.430 --> 06:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:19.070 --> 06:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
I think that it would be perfectly
 
06:12:20.810 --> 06:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
because it would be it would be
 
06:12:20.820 --> 06:12:22.730 align:start position:0%
because it would be it would be
desirable

06:12:22.730 --> 06:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
desirable
 
06:12:25.070 --> 06:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
for us
 
06:12:27.590 --> 06:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
to enact House Bill 615 which is coming
 
06:12:29.208 --> 06:12:29.218 align:start position:0%
up later
 
06:12:31.070 --> 06:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
and to say no we're not going to provide
 
06:12:32.570 --> 06:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
any money
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
to anybody that kills all those all
 
06:12:35.990 --> 06:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
those people
 
06:12:42.948 --> 06:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:45.530 --> 06:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
also representative
 
06:12:49.270 --> 06:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
no I just I follow up okay follow up
 
06:12:51.650 --> 06:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
it's really not a question I just want
 
06:12:54.170 --> 06:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
to thank you for being so directed we
 
06:12:55.670 --> 06:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
really should be confining our efforts
 
06:13:00.530 --> 06:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:03.110 --> 06:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you
 
06:13:04.610 --> 06:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant did you have a
 
06:13:04.620 --> 06:13:07.610 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant did you have a
question

06:13:07.610 --> 06:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:10.310 --> 06:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay maybe anyone else
 
06:13:12.070 --> 06:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
any any other questions
 
06:13:16.548 --> 06:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:20.448 --> 06:13:20.458 align:start position:0%
okay next signed up is Patricia Tilley
 
06:13:20.458 --> 06:13:26.868 align:start position:0%
okay next signed up is Patricia Tilley
Tory

06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:28.250 --> 06:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
wow okay
 
06:13:31.610 --> 06:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:33.230 --> 06:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you and again
 
06:13:34.670 --> 06:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Patricia
 
06:13:37.010 --> 06:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
Tilley I am the director of the division
 
06:13:38.690 --> 06:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
of Public Health Services at the New
 
06:13:39.890 --> 06:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
06:13:43.010 --> 06:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
Services and with me I have ciaoi Chala
 
06:13:45.288 --> 06:13:45.298 align:start position:0%
who was our bureau chief of our Public
 
06:13:48.610 --> 06:13:48.620 align:start position:0%
Health Bureau of informatics and health
 
06:13:51.230 --> 06:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
statistics so thank you very much you've
 
06:13:52.970 --> 06:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony today on this
 
06:13:55.010 --> 06:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
bill we are here to provide some
 
06:13:56.810 --> 06:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
additional information and answer answer
 
06:13:58.910 --> 06:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have from the
 
06:14:01.448 --> 06:14:01.458 align:start position:0%
public health side of this question
 
06:14:03.590 --> 06:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
primarily we want to let you know right
 
06:14:05.448 --> 06:14:05.458 align:start position:0%
away there is a fiscal note if you look
 
06:14:07.430 --> 06:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
electronically it was submitted it is
 
06:14:10.368 --> 06:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
live online right now so you can see the
 
06:14:12.770 --> 06:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
DHHS fiscal note right there I'm sure
 
06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton did not have
 
06:14:16.788 --> 06:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to see that yet but it
 
06:14:18.890 --> 06:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
is currently there for those who haven't
 
06:14:20.750 --> 06:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
had it take a look had a chance to take
 
06:14:23.030 --> 06:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
a look at that we can just tell you that
 
06:14:24.590 --> 06:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
we have suggested that it would cost
 
06:14:27.410 --> 06:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the area of about 140
 
06:14:30.288 --> 06:14:30.298 align:start position:0%
000 in order to do the requirements that
 
06:14:32.330 --> 06:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
this bill is asking the Department of
 
06:14:34.310 --> 06:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to do and that
 
06:14:36.288 --> 06:14:36.298 align:start position:0%
is around developing reporting
 
06:14:38.570 --> 06:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
structures and all not only the
 
06:14:40.190 --> 06:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
epidemiology of those reporting
 
06:14:41.570 --> 06:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
structures but also the data
 
06:14:44.030 --> 06:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
visualization on our whiz wisdom
 
06:14:46.250 --> 06:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
dashboard which is now called the New
 
06:14:49.548 --> 06:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DHHS data portal it is always
 
06:14:51.170 --> 06:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
going to be wisdom in some of our hearts
 
06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
but it is now called the New Hampshire
 
06:14:57.230 --> 06:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
DHHS data portal additionally we would
 
06:14:58.670 --> 06:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
like to note that there are some
 
06:15:01.430 --> 06:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
technical parts of this bill and that is
 
06:15:03.530 --> 06:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
included in our testimony around the
 
06:15:05.330 --> 06:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
citations around which laws need to be
 
06:15:08.750 --> 06:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
adjusted that I think the sponsor may be
 
06:15:11.990 --> 06:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
interested in as we move forward we are
 
06:15:13.970 --> 06:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions around the
 
06:15:17.208 --> 06:15:17.218 align:start position:0%
public health side of this data we have
 
06:15:18.788 --> 06:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
some concerns
 
06:15:21.770 --> 06:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
considerable concerns around the Privacy
 
06:15:24.530 --> 06:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
component simply the mechanisms of that
 
06:15:26.208 --> 06:15:26.218 align:start position:0%
I think you all discussed this earlier
 
06:15:28.730 --> 06:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
with the deputy from the Secretary of
 
06:15:31.010 --> 06:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
State's office in particular around the
 
06:15:33.590 --> 06:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
medical provider confidentiality number
 
06:15:36.948 --> 06:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the need to protect
 
06:15:39.288 --> 06:15:39.298 align:start position:0%
privacy but from a technical point of
 
06:15:41.690 --> 06:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
view I think that probably needs to be
 
06:15:43.670 --> 06:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
fleshed out a little bit more on how
 
06:15:45.128 --> 06:15:45.138 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
done within the division of Vital
 
06:15:49.128 --> 06:15:49.138 align:start position:0%
Records services so again not the
 
06:15:50.270 --> 06:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:15:52.128 --> 06:15:52.138 align:start position:0%
that directs the division of Vital
 
06:15:53.930 --> 06:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
Records to do that work we just wanted
 
06:15:56.170 --> 06:15:56.180 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that that seems to be
 
06:15:59.150 --> 06:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
tricky is is the technical word that I
 
06:16:02.570 --> 06:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
would do use for that of how you would
 
06:16:05.090 --> 06:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
create those confidential numbers give
 
06:16:07.310 --> 06:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
them to Providers and do the monthly
 
06:16:10.310 --> 06:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
reporting that is asked of any provider
 
06:16:13.070 --> 06:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
who may provide this service whether or
 
06:16:15.170 --> 06:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
not a procedure was given so I'm going
 
06:16:17.930 --> 06:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
to hand it over to Ms chawa and she will
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
fill in what I've left out it just
 
06:16:22.548 --> 06:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
follow the record my name is Jaco chawla
 
06:16:24.530 --> 06:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
I'm the bureau chief of Public Health
 
06:16:26.750 --> 06:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
statistic informatics in the division of
 
06:16:29.868 --> 06:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services just to emphasize
 
06:16:32.868 --> 06:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
what Trisha has addressed So currently
 
06:16:35.628 --> 06:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
there is no appropriation to support a
 
06:16:38.030 --> 06:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
data collection review validation
 
06:16:41.270 --> 06:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
preparation and also reporting in the
 
06:16:43.190 --> 06:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
public health services sorry in the
 
06:16:45.650 --> 06:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
physical note we did I suggest you have
 
06:16:48.948 --> 06:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
a one full-time positions as well as a
 
06:16:52.548 --> 06:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
10 full-time epic positions to perform
 
06:16:55.548 --> 06:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
this work and secondly the department
 
06:16:59.770 --> 06:16:59.780 align:start position:0%
acts as a vital record data through a
 
06:17:02.810 --> 06:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding established
 
06:17:05.208 --> 06:17:05.218 align:start position:0%
with division of Vital Records
 
06:17:07.970 --> 06:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
Administration in accordance with the
 
06:17:13.490 --> 06:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
RSA 12624 CC and this does not and the
 
06:17:14.930 --> 06:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
department does not have the ownership
 
06:17:17.868 --> 06:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
of Vital Records data and if this bill
 
06:17:20.570 --> 06:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
will move forward this will require both
 
06:17:26.570 --> 06:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
RSA 126 as well as RSA 5c to be amended
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
in order to provide the authority to
 
06:17:33.170 --> 06:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
collect the data for on this matter
 
06:17:36.470 --> 06:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
and also uh currently participating in
 
06:17:39.410 --> 06:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
the CDC abortion surveillance system
 
06:17:43.128 --> 06:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
reporting is voluntary so um and we
 
06:17:46.730 --> 06:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
contact the CDC and the reporting data
 
06:17:48.410 --> 06:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
elements will include the races
 
06:17:52.010 --> 06:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
necessity week of a gas station
 
06:17:55.448 --> 06:17:55.458 align:start position:0%
age in single year method of termination
 
06:17:57.470 --> 06:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
residents of states and other
 
06:17:59.990 --> 06:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
informations as well and also in
 
06:18:02.990 --> 06:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
contacting with CDC we realized that the
 
06:18:05.628 --> 06:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
CDC has contacted the division of Vital
 
06:18:10.368 --> 06:18:10.378 align:start position:0%
Records to encourage them to report the
 
06:18:13.368 --> 06:18:13.378 align:start position:0%
data to the CDC abortion surveillance
 
06:18:13.378 --> 06:18:14.470 align:start position:0%
data to the CDC abortion surveillance
system

06:18:14.470 --> 06:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:18:17.868 --> 06:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
and we do have the uh the email that
 
06:18:21.288 --> 06:18:21.298 align:start position:0%
reply back from CDC on this matter as
 
06:18:21.298 --> 06:18:22.128 align:start position:0%
reply back from CDC on this matter as
well

06:18:22.128 --> 06:18:22.138 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:18:25.610 --> 06:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
so so that that's what we have for today
 
06:18:27.948 --> 06:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
and we are happy to take any question
 
06:18:34.548 --> 06:18:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:39.288 --> 06:18:39.298 align:start position:0%
none yeah oh representative benagel
 
06:18:41.150 --> 06:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
I think you may have already answered oh
 
06:18:43.730 --> 06:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking that question
 
06:18:45.230 --> 06:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
um you may have already answered my
 
06:18:47.448 --> 06:18:47.458 align:start position:0%
question but according to the pretext of
 
06:18:50.448 --> 06:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
this bill it says that we are one of
 
06:18:54.230 --> 06:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
only three states that don't report
 
06:18:56.150 --> 06:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
um is there any knowledge of the data
 
06:18:57.708 --> 06:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
because there's a question about all the
 
06:19:00.048 --> 06:19:00.058 align:start position:0%
the questions that are being asked here
 
06:19:03.110 --> 06:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
do we have any knowledge of of are all
 
06:19:04.610 --> 06:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
these questions being asked in every
 
06:19:07.850 --> 06:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
state or is this a unique document here
 
06:19:09.410 --> 06:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
I'll take a swing at that thank you so
 
06:19:11.750 --> 06:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
much for your for your questions so we
 
06:19:13.548 --> 06:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
believe that many states are are
 
06:19:15.530 --> 06:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
providing much of that data there may be
 
06:19:17.390 --> 06:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
data elements that they don't provide of
 
06:19:20.030 --> 06:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
those 47 states that provide abortion
 
06:19:22.610 --> 06:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
data again to CDC of course that is
 
06:19:24.410 --> 06:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
de-identified there is no identifiable
 
06:19:27.170 --> 06:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
data going to CDC it should be noted and
 
06:19:29.030 --> 06:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
we've and several of the speakers prior
 
06:19:31.128 --> 06:19:31.138 align:start position:0%
to us have noted that there is voluntary
 
06:19:34.128 --> 06:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
collection of this data already that
 
06:19:35.208 --> 06:19:35.218 align:start position:0%
does not happen through the Department
 
06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services there's an
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
entity called The goodmacher Institute
 
06:19:40.970 --> 06:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
we've heard that reference today and
 
06:19:43.730 --> 06:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
they voluntarily collect abortion data
 
06:19:45.830 --> 06:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
not to this level
 
06:19:48.048 --> 06:19:48.058 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is the latest 2017
 
06:19:51.770 --> 06:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
numbers there were 2 200 abortions in
 
06:19:54.048 --> 06:19:54.058 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire in 2017 and
 
06:19:56.030 --> 06:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
that represents about a 12 percent
 
06:19:59.270 --> 06:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
decline between 2014 and 2017. I don't
 
06:20:03.650 --> 06:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
have more up-to-date data than that
 
06:20:08.090 --> 06:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:10.490 --> 06:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you thank
 
06:20:10.500 --> 06:20:14.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you thank
you

06:20:14.510 --> 06:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:16.070 --> 06:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you next signed up to testify
 
06:20:29.570 --> 06:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:31.310 --> 06:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of house
 
06:20:32.810 --> 06:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and elderly
 
06:20:35.030 --> 06:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
Affairs my name is Jason Hennessey I'm
 
06:20:37.310 --> 06:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
here today speaking
 
06:20:40.310 --> 06:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
um more to the Privacy aspects so I did
 
06:20:42.530 --> 06:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
my PhD in computational sciences and
 
06:20:45.708 --> 06:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
statistics and I've been a researcher
 
06:20:48.230 --> 06:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
for over a decade I've published on
 
06:20:51.350 --> 06:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
computer security and privacy topics in
 
06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
top venues I've also been the manager of
 
06:20:57.948 --> 06:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
a large informatics database containing
 
06:20:59.090 --> 06:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of Private health
 
06:21:00.590 --> 06:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
information that was part of a federal
 
06:21:02.510 --> 06:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
study and we had to meet Federal
 
06:21:04.070 --> 06:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
requirements so I wanted to talk a
 
06:21:06.110 --> 06:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
little bit about that in the interest of
 
06:21:07.368 --> 06:21:07.378 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I'm also the president
 
06:21:10.730 --> 06:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire right to life but I
 
06:21:12.410 --> 06:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
don't think you have to be pro-life to
 
06:21:15.048 --> 06:21:15.058 align:start position:0%
be in favor of this there's there are 47
 
06:21:17.330 --> 06:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
other states that that do this including
 
06:21:18.770 --> 06:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
States like New York and Massachusetts
 
06:21:21.948 --> 06:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
which would not be considered uh you
 
06:21:24.590 --> 06:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
know pro-life extremist States so I
 
06:21:26.448 --> 06:21:26.458 align:start position:0%
don't I guess I you don't you don't
 
06:21:27.650 --> 06:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
really need to be pro-life so I don't
 
06:21:29.770 --> 06:21:29.780 align:start position:0%
think that that's necessarily relevant
 
06:21:33.708 --> 06:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
if you are concerned about privacy I
 
06:21:35.208 --> 06:21:35.218 align:start position:0%
think you'll be much more concerned
 
06:21:37.490 --> 06:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
about the nhchis which is the
 
06:21:39.470 --> 06:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Healthcare information
 
06:21:39.480 --> 06:21:40.850 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Healthcare information
system

06:21:40.850 --> 06:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:21:42.830 --> 06:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
in that database there's a my
 
06:21:44.510 --> 06:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that database has
 
06:21:46.730 --> 06:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
all of the insurance transactions and
 
06:21:50.208 --> 06:21:50.218 align:start position:0%
has identifiable uh or has identifiers
 
06:21:52.310 --> 06:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
in it that would let you track across
 
06:21:53.930 --> 06:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
visits and across the entire database
 
06:21:55.970 --> 06:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
across health insurance providers they
 
06:21:57.530 --> 06:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
have an encrypted social security number
 
06:22:00.530 --> 06:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
in there and if you're worried about
 
06:22:02.510 --> 06:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
privacy you should really start there
 
06:22:04.670 --> 06:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
and this in this Database The Proposal
 
06:22:07.190 --> 06:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
that you have before you the the
 
06:22:09.948 --> 06:22:09.958 align:start position:0%
identifier is a one-off pre provided by
 
06:22:12.708 --> 06:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
the provider so my understanding from
 
06:22:14.330 --> 06:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
reading the bill is that you wouldn't
 
06:22:16.070 --> 06:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
even be able to identify somebody who
 
06:22:18.590 --> 06:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
went across providers so it would be it
 
06:22:20.990 --> 06:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
would be limited to just one
 
06:22:21.000 --> 06:22:22.368 align:start position:0%
would be limited to just one
um

06:22:22.368 --> 06:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:22.378 --> 06:22:23.570 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:22:23.570 --> 06:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:25.250 --> 06:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
in terms of I've heard some questions
 
06:22:27.470 --> 06:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
here about the research value
 
06:22:30.230 --> 06:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
I I think there's a lot of things so I
 
06:22:31.730 --> 06:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
guess the the number one thing that
 
06:22:34.190 --> 06:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
comes to mind would be the CDC uh they
 
06:22:36.410 --> 06:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
they publish data regularly using this
 
06:22:38.990 --> 06:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
database uh you know you might be you
 
06:22:41.208 --> 06:22:41.218 align:start position:0%
might be concerned are abortions safe
 
06:22:43.310 --> 06:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
are there certain people are there
 
06:22:45.048 --> 06:22:45.058 align:start position:0%
people at certain ages or certain
 
06:22:47.570 --> 06:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
gestation levels or
 
06:22:49.610 --> 06:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
um or in certain locations that are
 
06:22:51.890 --> 06:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
having more complications you know this
 
06:22:54.288 --> 06:22:54.298 align:start position:0%
is if the CDC is interested in this I
 
06:22:57.590 --> 06:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
guess the question is uh why else would
 
06:22:59.570 --> 06:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
you wonder about that
 
06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
um you know there is a vital research
 
06:23:03.708 --> 06:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
interest here and
 
06:23:05.448 --> 06:23:05.458 align:start position:0%
um I would also point out that you know
 
06:23:06.890 --> 06:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
for instance we had there was a question
 
06:23:10.128 --> 06:23:10.138 align:start position:0%
about do we need this and uh in 2020 the
 
06:23:11.930 --> 06:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed a bill requiring
 
06:23:13.610 --> 06:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
health insurance New Hampshire health
 
06:23:16.250 --> 06:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
insurance to cover abortion so I would
 
06:23:18.890 --> 06:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
say for you legislators knowing how many
 
06:23:21.350 --> 06:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
abortions there are that's a that's a
 
06:23:23.628 --> 06:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
pretty important question
 
06:23:25.610 --> 06:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
and with that I thank you Mr chairman
 
06:23:26.990 --> 06:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
and honorable members of the committee
 
06:23:28.490 --> 06:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
would love to take any questions okay
 
06:23:32.570 --> 06:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:35.390 --> 06:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
see none okay well thank you sir thank
 
06:23:37.070 --> 06:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
06:23:40.368 --> 06:23:40.378 align:start position:0%
and the last card I have for today on
 
06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:23:45.230 --> 06:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
is um Frank knock from the ACLU of New
 
06:23:45.240 --> 06:24:03.128 align:start position:0%
is um Frank knock from the ACLU of New
Hampshire

06:24:03.128 --> 06:24:03.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:05.208 --> 06:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
06:24:06.530 --> 06:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
06:24:08.208 --> 06:24:08.218 align:start position:0%
testify my name is Frank Knack I'm the
 
06:24:10.128 --> 06:24:10.138 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU of New
 
06:24:12.708 --> 06:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I apologize in advance if
 
06:24:14.390 --> 06:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
anything I say has already been repeated
 
06:24:16.490 --> 06:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
I was unfortunately in another hearing
 
06:24:19.430 --> 06:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
on another bill and just walked in
 
06:24:20.750 --> 06:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I'd like to just start by
 
06:24:22.250 --> 06:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
saying you know I think the one thing we
 
06:24:23.990 --> 06:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
can agree you know regardless of your
 
06:24:25.730 --> 06:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
political affiliation or your ideology
 
06:24:27.948 --> 06:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
as Granite Staters is that we care about
 
06:24:29.510 --> 06:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
our privacy we have some of the most
 
06:24:31.250 --> 06:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
robust privacy Protections in our
 
06:24:33.770 --> 06:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
constitution of any state
 
06:24:35.628 --> 06:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
um in this legislation poses a grave
 
06:24:38.090 --> 06:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
threat to the Privacy
 
06:24:40.850 --> 06:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
um of of lots of granite Staters
 
06:24:43.430 --> 06:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
under this a proposal
 
06:24:44.868 --> 06:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot about you know what
 
06:24:46.070 --> 06:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
other states are doing under this
 
06:24:48.530 --> 06:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
proposal there would be individualized
 
06:24:50.810 --> 06:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
data that would then be at the state
 
06:24:53.830 --> 06:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
level aggregate but at the initial
 
06:24:57.288 --> 06:24:57.298 align:start position:0%
creation of the data individualized and
 
06:24:58.610 --> 06:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
even just looking at what's happened
 
06:25:00.170 --> 06:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Department of
 
06:25:02.030 --> 06:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and data
 
06:25:04.250 --> 06:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
breaches back in 2016 there was a data
 
06:25:06.288 --> 06:25:06.298 align:start position:0%
breach that affected up to 15 000 people
 
06:25:08.990 --> 06:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
and so the notion that you know we are
 
06:25:11.390 --> 06:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
creating these individualized um data
 
06:25:13.310 --> 06:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
and that it's not at risk of getting out
 
06:25:14.810 --> 06:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
it's just not how it works in modern
 
06:25:16.788 --> 06:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
society with technology and with the
 
06:25:19.310 --> 06:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
ability to hack and with data breaches
 
06:25:21.770 --> 06:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
Etc and I think what makes that worse is
 
06:25:23.448 --> 06:25:23.458 align:start position:0%
that there's really no need for this
 
06:25:25.310 --> 06:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
legislation the Department of Vital
 
06:25:27.470 --> 06:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
Records Administration collects data
 
06:25:28.970 --> 06:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
about you know birth certificates
 
06:25:32.030 --> 06:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
marriage civil unions divorce and death
 
06:25:32.040 --> 06:25:33.170 align:start position:0%
marriage civil unions divorce and death
certificates

06:25:33.170 --> 06:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
06:25:36.110 --> 06:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
abortion is a medical procedure they do
 
06:25:37.850 --> 06:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
the department uh the Department of
 
06:25:39.470 --> 06:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
Vital Records collects no other
 
06:25:41.448 --> 06:25:41.458 align:start position:0%
information about any other medical
 
06:25:43.310 --> 06:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
procedure so why are we singling out
 
06:25:45.590 --> 06:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
abortion care a medical procedure for
 
06:25:47.690 --> 06:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
collection by this agency it makes no
 
06:25:47.700 --> 06:25:49.610 align:start position:0%
collection by this agency it makes no
sense

06:25:49.610 --> 06:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
sense
 
06:25:51.830 --> 06:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
and I'd also like to point out
 
06:25:52.730 --> 06:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
um you know there are some questions
 
06:25:55.250 --> 06:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
about you know 47 states do this well I
 
06:25:57.230 --> 06:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
think you know the details matter and I
 
06:25:59.448 --> 06:25:59.458 align:start position:0%
think message someone stated that
 
06:26:01.128 --> 06:26:01.138 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does this and
 
06:26:03.230 --> 06:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does this why can't we
 
06:26:04.670 --> 06:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important to look at
 
06:26:06.350 --> 06:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
what mass and what Vermont two of our
 
06:26:08.090 --> 06:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
neighboring states actually require so
 
06:26:10.250 --> 06:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
this is Massachusetts law right here
 
06:26:12.410 --> 06:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
just this little paragraph it's
 
06:26:13.730 --> 06:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
aggregate only there is no
 
06:26:15.530 --> 06:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
individualized data collected at all
 
06:26:17.510 --> 06:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
none of the numerous factors that this
 
06:26:20.208 --> 06:26:20.218 align:start position:0%
bill collects and Vermont again Vermont
 
06:26:22.190 --> 06:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
does not require any data collection
 
06:26:23.930 --> 06:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
about the patient this is Vermont's law
 
06:26:25.910 --> 06:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
there is no data collection about the
 
06:26:28.070 --> 06:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
patient and so this notion that 47
 
06:26:29.750 --> 06:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
states do this already is just not
 
06:26:32.570 --> 06:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
backed up by the facts our neighbors in
 
06:26:34.430 --> 06:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Massachusetts do not do it
 
06:26:36.890 --> 06:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
this way I think as Granite status we
 
06:26:38.390 --> 06:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
care about our privacy and the fact that
 
06:26:39.948 --> 06:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
even Vermont Massachusetts aren't doing
 
06:26:42.288 --> 06:26:42.298 align:start position:0%
this should send real signals to this
 
06:26:44.150 --> 06:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee that this is not fit for the
 
06:26:45.650 --> 06:26:45.660 align:start position:0%
granite state and happy to answer any
 
06:26:45.660 --> 06:26:47.570 align:start position:0%
granite state and happy to answer any
questions

06:26:47.570 --> 06:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:26:49.190 --> 06:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh questions
 
06:26:51.948 --> 06:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Merchant
 
06:26:53.510 --> 06:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:26:54.890 --> 06:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm not an attorney
 
06:26:56.930 --> 06:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
but I want to point something out that I
 
06:26:59.570 --> 06:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
read this morning on another bill and I
 
06:27:01.128 --> 06:27:01.138 align:start position:0%
wanted you to help me understand how
 
06:27:03.288 --> 06:27:03.298 align:start position:0%
this may impact that
 
06:27:04.670 --> 06:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
according to what it says here New
 
06:27:05.810 --> 06:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vote has passed the right to
 
06:27:07.610 --> 06:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
privacy into the state constitution to
 
06:27:11.448 --> 06:27:11.458 align:start position:0%
November 2018 with an 81 approval with
 
06:27:13.010 --> 06:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
that vote state government culture and
 
06:27:14.750 --> 06:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
behavior needed to shape be shaped by
 
06:27:16.430 --> 06:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
the words an individuals right
 
06:27:19.190 --> 06:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
individuals right to live free from
 
06:27:21.110 --> 06:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion in private
 
06:27:23.270 --> 06:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
private personal information is natural
 
06:27:26.750 --> 06:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
essential inherent in your opinion is
 
06:27:28.430 --> 06:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
this going to conflict with our
 
06:27:30.890 --> 06:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
constitution our ability as a citizen of
 
06:27:32.930 --> 06:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
our state to keep the government out of
 
06:27:34.970 --> 06:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
our data so we have not done a specific
 
06:27:36.708 --> 06:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
analysis on this versus the
 
06:27:38.030 --> 06:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
Constitutional protections but I'd be
 
06:27:40.010 --> 06:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
happy to do that and get a memo back to
 
06:27:42.788 --> 06:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:45.530 --> 06:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
06:27:47.150 --> 06:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:27:51.770 --> 06:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
question can you explain to me why the
 
06:27:54.350 --> 06:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
ACLU objects to collecting this data
 
06:27:56.990 --> 06:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
specifically and
 
06:28:00.288 --> 06:28:00.298 align:start position:0%
um doesn't object to
 
06:28:02.208 --> 06:28:02.218 align:start position:0%
the Department of Vital Statistics
 
06:28:04.850 --> 06:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
asking if there were perennial
 
06:28:07.610 --> 06:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
lacerations if there was an unplanned
 
06:28:07.620 --> 06:28:09.070 align:start position:0%
lacerations if there was an unplanned
hysterectomy

06:28:09.070 --> 06:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy
 
06:28:11.810 --> 06:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
what was the last outcome of the
 
06:28:15.530 --> 06:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
previous pregnancy there are very very
 
06:28:20.208 --> 06:28:20.218 align:start position:0%
deep questions on the birth worksheet
 
06:28:22.788 --> 06:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Vital Statistics
 
06:28:26.150 --> 06:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
is our Vital Records and statistics is
 
06:28:29.090 --> 06:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
already collecting that so can you speak
 
06:28:30.230 --> 06:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
to that a little bit what's the
 
06:28:32.510 --> 06:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
difference between a live birth a mother
 
06:28:36.590 --> 06:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
of a live birth needing to divulge that
 
06:28:40.128 --> 06:28:40.138 align:start position:0%
information herself and there be and
 
06:28:42.410 --> 06:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
that being okay and it being not okay
 
06:28:45.070 --> 06:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
for a physician to send a monthly report
 
06:28:48.350 --> 06:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
of similar information yeah I appreciate
 
06:28:51.048 --> 06:28:51.058 align:start position:0%
the question so um I I'm not sure the
 
06:28:53.570 --> 06:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
specifics of the the scenario just
 
06:28:54.770 --> 06:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
raised so I don't know what our position
 
06:28:56.448 --> 06:28:56.458 align:start position:0%
was in the past on that issue I'd be
 
06:28:58.970 --> 06:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
happy to look into that but in this case
 
06:29:01.128 --> 06:29:01.138 align:start position:0%
you know this is a medical procedure and
 
06:29:02.930 --> 06:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
the fact that the vital statistics folks
 
06:29:05.030 --> 06:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
are not collecting data on any other
 
06:29:07.490 --> 06:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
medical procedure especially one that is
 
06:29:08.990 --> 06:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
like abortion that is you know
 
06:29:11.830 --> 06:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
universally recognized as safe
 
06:29:15.590 --> 06:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
is is troubling and in the fact that
 
06:29:17.270 --> 06:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
um you know this the way that they would
 
06:29:19.490 --> 06:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
collect this data unlike our neighbors
 
06:29:21.410 --> 06:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts unlike our neighbors in
 
06:29:24.170 --> 06:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
Vermont puts people's individual privacy
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
and personal medical decisions at risk
 
06:29:28.190 --> 06:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily we think is deeply
 
06:29:28.200 --> 06:29:30.730 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily we think is deeply
problematic

06:29:30.730 --> 06:29:30.740 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
06:29:34.070 --> 06:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
06:29:34.080 --> 06:29:35.390 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro thank you Mr

committee with the references to the
 
06:29:43.730 --> 06:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
laws in Massachusetts and Vermont and
 
06:29:45.470 --> 06:29:45.480 align:start position:0%

06:29:48.470 --> 06:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
um do submit to the CDC uh absolutely I
 
06:29:50.270 --> 06:29:50.280 align:start position:0%

representative Weber

okay
 
06:30:00.830 --> 06:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:02.570 --> 06:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you very much
 
06:30:04.310 --> 06:30:04.320 align:start position:0%

of no one else here to testify on this
 
06:30:11.448 --> 06:30:11.458 align:start position:0%
bill is there anyone else here to
 
06:30:11.458 --> 06:30:13.788 align:start position:0%
bill is there anyone else here to
testify

06:30:13.788 --> 06:30:13.798 align:start position:0%
testify
 
06:30:16.010 --> 06:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay if that's the case then I am
 
06:30:17.690 --> 06:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
closing the public hearing on House Bill
 
06:30:20.810 --> 06:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
582 and what appears to be our last bill
 
06:30:22.670 --> 06:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the day at least according to my
 
06:30:25.970 --> 06:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
records is House Bill 615 I am going to
 
06:30:28.070 --> 06:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
06:30:31.208 --> 06:30:31.218 align:start position:0%
615 at this time and
 
06:30:34.548 --> 06:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
recognize and invite back for sub for
 
06:30:35.948 --> 06:30:35.958 align:start position:0%

06:30:40.190 --> 06:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:52.850 --> 06:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:54.708 --> 06:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
I think representative Edward you missed
 
06:30:56.270 --> 06:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
being in the finance room that's why you
 
06:30:58.250 --> 06:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
keep coming to see us today
 
06:31:00.708 --> 06:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
actually I'm not allowed to leave this
 
06:31:03.948 --> 06:31:03.958 align:start position:0%
room uh but uh okay so I'm
 
06:31:05.750 --> 06:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards Rockingham
 
06:31:08.270 --> 06:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
District 31. I hail from Auburn
 
06:31:12.110 --> 06:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
representing Auburn Candia Chester and
 
06:31:15.650 --> 06:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
Deerfield I'm here today as the prime
 
06:31:19.628 --> 06:31:19.638 align:start position:0%
sponsor of of HB
 
06:31:25.190 --> 06:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
615 to introduce the bill I I think for
 
06:31:28.368 --> 06:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
context uh it's kind of important for
 
06:31:31.570 --> 06:31:31.580 align:start position:0%
folks who who don't know me
 
06:31:34.910 --> 06:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
and are listening to what I'm about to
 
06:31:37.910 --> 06:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
say to understand that I grew up in an
 
06:31:42.490 --> 06:31:42.500 align:start position:0%
era of Roe v Wade and that despite Dobbs
 
06:31:45.770 --> 06:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
that decision my mental framework is
 
06:31:48.288 --> 06:31:48.298 align:start position:0%
still pretty much that the right to an
 
06:31:51.650 --> 06:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
abortion is a constitutionally protected
 
06:31:55.310 --> 06:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
medical procedure and so um so I'm not
 
06:31:59.330 --> 06:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
here to attack a boy portion or access
 
06:32:03.830 --> 06:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
to abortion I'm here as the chairman of
 
06:32:05.448 --> 06:32:05.458 align:start position:0%
division three who went through the
 
06:32:08.510 --> 06:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
budget process last year and saw how
 
06:32:10.788 --> 06:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
little money the state had to put into
 
06:32:13.910 --> 06:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
Family Planning Family Planning we fund
 
06:32:17.448 --> 06:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
planning Family Planning that we had so
 
06:32:18.830 --> 06:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
little money it's like eight hundred
 
06:32:21.708 --> 06:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year that I just
 
06:32:24.230 --> 06:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to protect our family planning
 
06:32:27.970 --> 06:32:27.980 align:start position:0%
resources and as it turns out
 
06:32:32.390 --> 06:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
a few of the vendors that go compete for
 
06:32:34.868 --> 06:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
our family planning dollars
 
06:32:37.030 --> 06:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
are among them
 
06:32:41.690 --> 06:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
our abortion providers they prefer the
 
06:32:44.470 --> 06:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
term reproductive Health Care Facilities
 
06:32:47.150 --> 06:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
but if you go look at what the
 
06:32:49.128 --> 06:32:49.138 align:start position:0%
definition of that is again this is for
 
06:32:51.770 --> 06:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
the new people that's that's
 
06:32:54.288 --> 06:32:54.298 align:start position:0%
intentionally obfuscated language
 
06:32:57.110 --> 06:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
because the definition in the in the
 
06:32:59.690 --> 06:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
statute is essentially an outpatient
 
06:33:02.510 --> 06:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
abortion clinic and so so if we're going
 
06:33:04.250 --> 06:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
to have a real discussion we just need
 
06:33:06.410 --> 06:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
to know the difference between an
 
06:33:09.830 --> 06:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
outpatient abortion clinic and a family
 
06:33:12.288 --> 06:33:12.298 align:start position:0%
planning Clinic I think I think they are
 
06:33:15.590 --> 06:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
materially different the Family Planning
 
06:33:19.548 --> 06:33:19.558 align:start position:0%
Clinic I think has the mission of of
 
06:33:23.448 --> 06:33:23.458 align:start position:0%
helping couples have a family and to
 
06:33:25.368 --> 06:33:25.378 align:start position:0%
have a family when they choose to have a
 
06:33:28.010 --> 06:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
family and so things like birth control
 
06:33:32.750 --> 06:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
to include iuds and Lark which is uh I
 
06:33:36.170 --> 06:33:36.180 align:start position:0%
forget the acronym but it's a long-term
 
06:33:36.180 --> 06:33:38.590 align:start position:0%
forget the acronym but it's a long-term
um

06:33:38.590 --> 06:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:41.390 --> 06:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
anti-fertility I'm messing up my word
 
06:33:44.230 --> 06:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
there but it's birth control
 
06:33:47.208 --> 06:33:47.218 align:start position:0%
providing cancer screenings providing
 
06:33:49.990 --> 06:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
STD testing and treatment providing
 
06:33:54.590 --> 06:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
preventive care to so that the mom now
 
06:33:56.990 --> 06:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
or in the future can remain healthy
 
06:33:59.530 --> 06:33:59.540 align:start position:0%
those are all great Family Planning
 
06:34:02.390 --> 06:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
clinical objectives completely support
 
06:34:04.310 --> 06:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
them I want the eight hundred thousand
 
06:34:06.948 --> 06:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
dollars we spent on it a year to to go
 
06:34:11.208 --> 06:34:11.218 align:start position:0%
for those purposes and so what this is
 
06:34:15.830 --> 06:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh is meant to do is to ensure that
 
06:34:18.190 --> 06:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
06:34:22.330 --> 06:34:22.340 align:start position:0%
firewall between Family Planning and
 
06:34:26.350 --> 06:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
abortion services and by firewall
 
06:34:29.628 --> 06:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
I have used the phrase
 
06:34:33.070 --> 06:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
financial and physical separation
 
06:34:38.628 --> 06:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
in hb2 last year the the term got
 
06:34:42.948 --> 06:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
reduced to just Financial separation and
 
06:34:44.868 --> 06:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
so I've had a couple years to walk
 
06:34:47.628 --> 06:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
around that a bit and you know it didn't
 
06:34:50.690 --> 06:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
I did I didn't like that we we struck it
 
06:34:53.030 --> 06:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
and made it just Financial separation I
 
06:34:56.270 --> 06:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
wanted physical separation as well but
 
06:34:58.970 --> 06:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
it's something I can live with there
 
06:35:03.530 --> 06:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
were concerns that we were being trying
 
06:35:06.170 --> 06:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
to take away a woman's right to choose
 
06:35:08.628 --> 06:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
an abortion I I don't think we did that
 
06:35:10.368 --> 06:35:10.378 align:start position:0%
we you know if they're getting
 
06:35:13.310 --> 06:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
counseling on their options they can
 
06:35:16.010 --> 06:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
certainly be referred out or or have
 
06:35:19.368 --> 06:35:19.378 align:start position:0%
somebody tell them to go where they
 
06:35:22.670 --> 06:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
could go for an abortion uh so we're not
 
06:35:24.890 --> 06:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
trying to stop that and as a matter of
 
06:35:27.590 --> 06:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
fact the bill specifically says that the
 
06:35:31.430 --> 06:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
state shall pay our minimum share to
 
06:35:33.650 --> 06:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
participate in Medicaid so that minimum
 
06:35:38.510 --> 06:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:41.690 --> 06:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
what we're really looking to have done
 
06:35:44.810 --> 06:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
is to have an independent audit what we
 
06:35:47.570 --> 06:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
had heard for years years and years
 
06:35:50.330 --> 06:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
probably you know since I first paid
 
06:35:53.810 --> 06:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
attention to this issue in the 70s is
 
06:35:55.788 --> 06:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
that there's no commingling of money
 
06:35:58.190 --> 06:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
between abortion providers and Family
 
06:36:00.410 --> 06:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
Planning money we heard that we heard it
 
06:36:05.150 --> 06:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
we heard it so in hb2 last year we said
 
06:36:07.250 --> 06:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
okay you know kind of like a Missouri
 
06:36:10.190 --> 06:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
person I'm not a Missourian but you know
 
06:36:14.868 --> 06:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
show me so so we we in hb2 for the first
 
06:36:17.708 --> 06:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
time ask that
 
06:36:20.448 --> 06:36:20.458 align:start position:0%
DHHS conduct an inspection of the
 
06:36:22.190 --> 06:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
financial records and to provide a
 
06:36:26.530 --> 06:36:26.540 align:start position:0%
certification that's what hp2 did when
 
06:36:29.650 --> 06:36:29.660 align:start position:0%
this certification
 
06:36:32.628 --> 06:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
which I I think Planned Parenthood has
 
06:36:35.448 --> 06:36:35.458 align:start position:0%
in their testimony from the Department
 
06:36:38.650 --> 06:36:38.660 align:start position:0%
got to the executive Council
 
06:36:42.110 --> 06:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
my executive counselor didn't think it
 
06:36:45.650 --> 06:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
was adequate or sufficient and and I I
 
06:36:47.208 --> 06:36:47.218 align:start position:0%
don't know what the exit how the
 
06:36:50.390 --> 06:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
executive Council thinks But but so they
 
06:36:54.830 --> 06:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:54.840 --> 06:36:55.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:36:55.690 --> 06:36:55.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:58.310 --> 06:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
some of the contracts
 
06:37:00.770 --> 06:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
that would have gone through Planned
 
06:37:00.780 --> 06:37:01.910 align:start position:0%
that would have gone through Planned
Parenthood

06:37:01.910 --> 06:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
Parenthood
 
06:37:05.750 --> 06:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
to create Family Planning services and
 
06:37:09.048 --> 06:37:09.058 align:start position:0%
so that executive counselor asked me to
 
06:37:11.048 --> 06:37:11.058 align:start position:0%
support uh
 
06:37:15.590 --> 06:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
submit this bill on her behalf so that
 
06:37:18.890 --> 06:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
what we are now wanting to do is to have
 
06:37:20.868 --> 06:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
an independent audit
 
06:37:23.090 --> 06:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
and I think you'll you can read the
 
06:37:24.610 --> 06:37:24.620 align:start position:0%
phrase online
 
06:37:28.310 --> 06:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
13 and 14 of the first page of the
 
06:37:31.628 --> 06:37:31.638 align:start position:0%
legislation we're asking for
 
06:37:37.190 --> 06:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
an external independent audit by a CPA
 
06:37:39.590 --> 06:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
and provide the results along with any
 
06:37:41.810 --> 06:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan to the
 
06:37:44.690 --> 06:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner of DHHS so that's an
 
06:37:47.030 --> 06:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
independent audit now is that a
 
06:37:50.868 --> 06:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
requirement for Planned Parenthood no
 
06:37:54.048 --> 06:37:54.058 align:start position:0%
it's not it's a requirement no it's not
 
06:37:56.990 --> 06:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement for every family
 
06:38:00.170 --> 06:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
planning project that's on line 13.
 
06:38:03.948 --> 06:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
so the obligation to get the audit is
 
06:38:06.530 --> 06:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
associated with the decision
 
06:38:08.990 --> 06:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
to compete for our family planning
 
06:38:13.250 --> 06:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
contracts it's not targeted at any one
 
06:38:15.708 --> 06:38:15.718 align:start position:0%
organization it's targeted to protect
 
06:38:17.570 --> 06:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
our family planning money it may
 
06:38:21.230 --> 06:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
certainly have a large impact on a
 
06:38:24.048 --> 06:38:24.058 align:start position:0%
particular vendor of Family Planning
 
06:38:26.990 --> 06:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
services but but it isn't it isn't
 
06:38:29.750 --> 06:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily targeted
 
06:38:33.410 --> 06:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
um there's I think a slip up in in the
 
06:38:38.868 --> 06:38:38.878 align:start position:0%
language of the bill uh online nine
 
06:38:41.570 --> 06:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
where it refers to a geographic
 
06:38:43.610 --> 06:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
connection it says if a planning plot
 
06:38:47.030 --> 06:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
plant Family Planning project has any
 
06:38:50.628 --> 06:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
Financial or Geographic connection to an
 
06:38:52.670 --> 06:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
abortion clinic that provides abortion
 
06:38:55.128 --> 06:38:55.138 align:start position:0%
Services the state contract shall
 
06:38:58.610 --> 06:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
specify the following well I don't know
 
06:39:00.170 --> 06:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
where the phrase Geographic connection
 
06:39:02.570 --> 06:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
came in that's that wasn't part of any
 
06:39:05.628 --> 06:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
dialogue any testimony and it's a
 
06:39:07.430 --> 06:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
drafting error that I'm accountable for
 
06:39:10.128 --> 06:39:10.138 align:start position:0%
so so I'll just I'll just do a Mia culpa
 
06:39:11.448 --> 06:39:11.458 align:start position:0%
on that
 
06:39:13.250 --> 06:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
um I um
 
06:39:13.260 --> 06:39:14.448 align:start position:0%
um I um
I

06:39:14.448 --> 06:39:14.458 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:39:18.590 --> 06:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
I want that to be stricken and just made
 
06:39:20.930 --> 06:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
a a financial connection
 
06:39:23.690 --> 06:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
to a reproductive Health Clinic
 
06:39:25.670 --> 06:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
um because I think that's easier to
 
06:39:27.708 --> 06:39:27.718 align:start position:0%
determine it's an easier test to
 
06:39:29.270 --> 06:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not an audit is
 
06:39:29.280 --> 06:39:31.548 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not an audit is
required

06:39:31.548 --> 06:39:31.558 align:start position:0%
required
 
06:39:35.690 --> 06:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh co-location may still be appropriate
 
06:39:37.310 --> 06:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
as well though because co-location
 
06:39:39.470 --> 06:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
implies to sharing of facility sharing
 
06:39:42.410 --> 06:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
of overhead sharing a Personnel just to
 
06:39:44.270 --> 06:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
give you one example of the sharing of
 
06:39:44.280 --> 06:39:45.610 align:start position:0%
give you one example of the sharing of
personnel

06:39:45.610 --> 06:39:45.620 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
06:39:47.948 --> 06:39:47.958 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
06:39:51.708 --> 06:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
executive director who who runs Planned
 
06:39:54.770 --> 06:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
Parenthood of Northern New England the
 
06:39:58.010 --> 06:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
medical director Dr Donna Burkett and I
 
06:40:01.010 --> 06:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
I'm told she makes 286
 
06:40:04.548 --> 06:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
000 and change a year in that when in
 
06:40:08.690 --> 06:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
2019 she lobbied the Vermont legislature
 
06:40:11.208 --> 06:40:11.218 align:start position:0%
to add abortion to the Vermont
 
06:40:14.330 --> 06:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
Constitution the New Hampshire Family
 
06:40:16.730 --> 06:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
Planning program was paying 20 percent
 
06:40:17.990 --> 06:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
of her salary
 
06:40:21.350 --> 06:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
so so that's the kind of thing that
 
06:40:24.288 --> 06:40:24.298 align:start position:0%
stick your finger in somebody's eye that
 
06:40:27.350 --> 06:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
that really has caused this show me
 
06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
attitude to request a financial audit be
 
06:40:31.200 --> 06:40:33.708 align:start position:0%
attitude to request a financial audit be
conducted

06:40:33.708 --> 06:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
conducted
 
06:40:36.708 --> 06:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm about to wrap up Mr chair I'm
 
06:40:40.310 --> 06:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
just looking at my notes to make sure
 
06:40:40.320 --> 06:40:45.650 align:start position:0%
just looking at my notes to make sure
um

06:40:45.650 --> 06:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:48.470 --> 06:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay so so the audit that we're
 
06:40:50.628 --> 06:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
requesting the executive Council said
 
06:40:52.548 --> 06:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
that they they would like the results of
 
06:40:54.650 --> 06:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
it along with any corrective action plan
 
06:40:58.448 --> 06:40:58.458 align:start position:0%
a week prior to considering any contract
 
06:41:01.970 --> 06:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
to a family planning vendor with a uh
 
06:41:06.368 --> 06:41:06.378 align:start position:0%
what I will say is with a um
 
06:41:11.810 --> 06:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
a financial or physical co-location with
 
06:41:14.208 --> 06:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
the family planning services and and the
 
06:41:16.970 --> 06:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Center so so I owe
 
06:41:18.708 --> 06:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
you I think an amendment a tiny
 
06:41:21.470 --> 06:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to fix that that line because
 
06:41:24.170 --> 06:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
the geographic connection I think I
 
06:41:26.330 --> 06:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
agree completely with uh planned
 
06:41:28.310 --> 06:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
parenthood's upcoming testimony that
 
06:41:30.890 --> 06:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
that's overly Broad and complicating and
 
06:41:33.170 --> 06:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
just is dumb I don't know why I didn't
 
06:41:35.750 --> 06:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
catch it so
 
06:41:37.850 --> 06:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
um anything else
 
06:41:41.270 --> 06:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
I I also want to point out I think that
 
06:41:44.290 --> 06:41:44.300 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
06:41:44.300 --> 06:41:45.590 align:start position:0%
in 2021

Planned Parenthood of New Northern New
 
06:41:52.190 --> 06:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
England was spending 2.3 million dollars
 
06:41:55.368 --> 06:41:55.378 align:start position:0%
a year on lobbying and after hb2 came
 
06:41:58.670 --> 06:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
out that increased 400 000 to 2.7
 
06:42:01.610 --> 06:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
million so they had 400 000 extra to
 
06:42:04.788 --> 06:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
throw into their lobbying efforts and in
 
06:42:07.750 --> 06:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
a independent expenditure report
 
06:42:10.850 --> 06:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
submitted to on behalf Planned
 
06:42:13.430 --> 06:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
Parenthood New England action fund I'd
 
06:42:15.610 --> 06:42:15.620 align:start position:0%
want to point out that they
 
06:42:19.070 --> 06:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
contributed nearly 193 thousand dollars
 
06:42:23.150 --> 06:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
to political campaigns none of which
 
06:42:25.190 --> 06:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
went to help my campaign for what it's
 
06:42:29.510 --> 06:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
worth so uh okay I am not expecting any
 
06:42:31.548 --> 06:42:31.558 align:start position:0%
in the future right now but I would not
 
06:42:36.590 --> 06:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:39.590 --> 06:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:42:41.390 --> 06:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question and let me just say
 
06:42:43.970 --> 06:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
nor my campaign
 
06:42:43.980 --> 06:42:45.230 align:start position:0%
nor my campaign
um

06:42:45.230 --> 06:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:46.910 --> 06:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
could you help me out with my chicken
 
06:42:49.250 --> 06:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
and egg problem here
 
06:42:52.190 --> 06:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
you can't get any state funds unless you
 
06:42:54.530 --> 06:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
have an audit to show that you're not
 
06:42:56.750 --> 06:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
spending the state funds that you
 
06:43:00.350 --> 06:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
haven't received yet inappropriately
 
06:43:03.650 --> 06:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure I understand how you do
 
06:43:05.270 --> 06:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
the audit because you haven't got the
 
06:43:06.890 --> 06:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
state funds yet because you can't get
 
06:43:09.970 --> 06:43:09.980 align:start position:0%
the state funds until you have the audit
 
06:43:12.948 --> 06:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
which presumably isn't auditing the
 
06:43:16.250 --> 06:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:19.910 --> 06:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
great question thank you uh I'm glad you
 
06:43:22.070 --> 06:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
didn't ask while I was hungry
 
06:43:25.250 --> 06:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
um but uh for the the the chicken and
 
06:43:27.650 --> 06:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
egg on this is that remember these are
 
06:43:31.128 --> 06:43:31.138 align:start position:0%
Family Planning uh contracts and that we
 
06:43:35.150 --> 06:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
do have uh Family Planning vendors that
 
06:43:37.850 --> 06:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
that's all they do so those contracts
 
06:43:41.030 --> 06:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
have gone out to established Family
 
06:43:42.948 --> 06:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
Planning providers
 
06:43:47.270 --> 06:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
the the hang up has been on on the the
 
06:43:49.548 --> 06:43:49.558 align:start position:0%
ones that are affiliated with abortion
 
06:43:52.448 --> 06:43:52.458 align:start position:0%
Services they've they've had difficulty
 
06:43:55.070 --> 06:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
convincing the executive Council that
 
06:43:56.930 --> 06:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
they've done the due diligence to to
 
06:44:00.250 --> 06:44:00.260 align:start position:0%
ensure Financial separation and and the
 
06:44:02.390 --> 06:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
determination of that is the executive
 
06:44:04.368 --> 06:44:04.378 align:start position:0%
Council it's not mine
 
06:44:08.090 --> 06:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
um but uh so there isn't an expectation
 
06:44:11.330 --> 06:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
that anyone who isn't currently in
 
06:44:13.548 --> 06:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
business is going to apply for one of
 
06:44:16.430 --> 06:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
these contracts so there will be ongoing
 
06:44:19.850 --> 06:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
business operations for whoever bids on
 
06:44:22.850 --> 06:44:22.860 align:start position:0%
these contracts and so it's it's an
 
06:44:25.610 --> 06:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
audit of their ongoing Financial
 
06:44:25.620 --> 06:44:27.048 align:start position:0%
audit of their ongoing Financial
concerns

06:44:27.048 --> 06:44:27.058 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
06:44:29.868 --> 06:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
06:44:33.410 --> 06:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:39.170 --> 06:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:42.548 --> 06:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
but my understanding was that the
 
06:44:46.670 --> 06:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
funding was denied so it doesn't exist
 
06:44:49.788 --> 06:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
anymore so how do you start over again I
 
06:44:51.230 --> 06:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
mean how do you audit it when you've
 
06:44:53.930 --> 06:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
already ended that particular
 
06:44:56.208 --> 06:44:56.218 align:start position:0%
contract and haven't started it up again
 
06:44:58.310 --> 06:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
and can't start it up because you can't
 
06:45:01.368 --> 06:45:01.378 align:start position:0%
have an audit so okay so that's a great
 
06:45:03.650 --> 06:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
question and I'd I'd be happy to work
 
06:45:05.890 --> 06:45:05.900 align:start position:0%
with you on some some
 
06:45:08.930 --> 06:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
tailoring language around this I I can
 
06:45:11.868 --> 06:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
tell you when hb2 language got inserted
 
06:45:15.890 --> 06:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
I was I was as much bystander and and
 
06:45:18.190 --> 06:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
witness as I was author
 
06:45:21.830 --> 06:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
and what it always meant to me was that
 
06:45:24.530 --> 06:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
we could request that audit you know
 
06:45:26.990 --> 06:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
during the term of the contract
 
06:45:30.048 --> 06:45:30.058 align:start position:0%
and and and and and my interpretation
 
06:45:31.670 --> 06:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
that it was something that could be
 
06:45:33.410 --> 06:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
triggered during the term of the
 
06:45:36.948 --> 06:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
contract got morphed by the executive
 
06:45:39.490 --> 06:45:39.500 align:start position:0%
Council to be interpreted as a condition
 
06:45:42.708 --> 06:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
to have a contract let which is a
 
06:45:46.368 --> 06:45:46.378 align:start position:0%
totally different thing and and so so if
 
06:45:50.868 --> 06:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
if this was a question of
 
06:45:53.510 --> 06:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
um uh should we
 
06:45:56.750 --> 06:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
require the audit after a year of
 
06:45:58.730 --> 06:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
operation or something like that so
 
06:46:01.670 --> 06:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's something to audit uh I I would
 
06:46:03.770 --> 06:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
be in agreement with that either that
 
06:46:05.390 --> 06:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
would make sense
 
06:46:05.400 --> 06:46:05.930 align:start position:0%
would make sense
um

06:46:05.930 --> 06:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:08.030 --> 06:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
and as I said you know the executive
 
06:46:09.770 --> 06:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
council is our own entity and they
 
06:46:11.690 --> 06:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
interpreted the law Beyond differently
 
06:46:15.288 --> 06:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:18.170 --> 06:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
06:46:20.990 --> 06:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
06:46:23.930 --> 06:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about the term external
 
06:46:25.968 --> 06:46:25.978 align:start position:0%
independent audit by a certified public
 
06:46:29.230 --> 06:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
accountant who decides
 
06:46:32.510 --> 06:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
which certified public accountant who
 
06:46:35.750 --> 06:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
who approves of that who who decides
 
06:46:39.190 --> 06:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
because we've seen that the
 
06:46:43.490 --> 06:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
DHHS was doing these audits but by some
 
06:46:44.990 --> 06:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
people's standards that wasn't good
 
06:46:48.410 --> 06:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
enough so how do we make it so that this
 
06:46:50.810 --> 06:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
audit will be acceptable who gets to
 
06:46:53.570 --> 06:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
decide who that auditor is so if you
 
06:46:56.448 --> 06:46:56.458 align:start position:0%
pass this law word for word I think I
 
06:46:58.368 --> 06:46:58.378 align:start position:0%
think to get the ball through the goal
 
06:47:00.650 --> 06:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
posts all it would need to do is to meet
 
06:47:03.530 --> 06:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
the words in the statute it it we
 
06:47:05.868 --> 06:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be telling them a determinative
 
06:47:09.590 --> 06:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
way and to select the external CPA to do
 
06:47:12.010 --> 06:47:12.020 align:start position:0%
an independent audit we would just
 
06:47:14.330 --> 06:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
receive an audit
 
06:47:17.330 --> 06:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
and we would verify that it met the
 
06:47:19.968 --> 06:47:19.978 align:start position:0%
conditions and and and and if you would
 
06:47:22.548 --> 06:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable adding some
 
06:47:26.570 --> 06:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
language in order to uh pick this who
 
06:47:28.730 --> 06:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
selects I you know I I don't have a
 
06:47:30.468 --> 06:47:30.478 align:start position:0%
problem with that I I actually think
 
06:47:33.170 --> 06:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit more flexible uh and
 
06:47:34.968 --> 06:47:34.978 align:start position:0%
perhaps more acceptable I mean to the
 
06:47:36.948 --> 06:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
extent that there anyone wants to accept
 
06:47:39.650 --> 06:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
this if if if we leave it a little
 
06:47:42.830 --> 06:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
flexible there but I leave it to the
 
06:47:46.670 --> 06:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
committee so the so the way it's written
 
06:47:48.948 --> 06:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
now your understanding is that the
 
06:47:51.830 --> 06:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
agency who's being audited would would
 
06:47:55.010 --> 06:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
find an auditor and I assume would pay
 
06:47:56.570 --> 06:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
for it as well
 
06:47:59.390 --> 06:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh we don't talk about pay uh who pays
 
06:48:03.048 --> 06:48:03.058 align:start position:0%
for it but I think that's rational that
 
06:48:04.610 --> 06:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
they would end up paying for it and then
 
06:48:07.368 --> 06:48:07.378 align:start position:0%
they would select it and and there would
 
06:48:10.250 --> 06:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
be you know some some concern on their
 
06:48:12.350 --> 06:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
part that the executive Council would
 
06:48:14.930 --> 06:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
view it as independent
 
06:48:17.990 --> 06:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know external and
 
06:48:18.000 --> 06:48:18.650 align:start position:0%
you know external and
um

06:48:18.650 --> 06:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:20.390 --> 06:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
the other term
 
06:48:22.128 --> 06:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
thank you it's getting late I don't know
 
06:48:24.170 --> 06:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
how you guys are doing it
 
06:48:25.968 --> 06:48:25.978 align:start position:0%
the other questions
 
06:48:30.230 --> 06:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:32.448 --> 06:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
so if we're talking I think I heard the
 
06:48:34.070 --> 06:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
figure about eight hundred thousand
 
06:48:37.310 --> 06:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
dollars in in funding going out
 
06:48:39.350 --> 06:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
isn't it possible that people could
 
06:48:42.530 --> 06:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
expend more than that in turn just in
 
06:48:44.930 --> 06:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
preparing the audits
 
06:48:47.930 --> 06:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
I don't think so uh I I think anything's
 
06:48:50.628 --> 06:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
possible I I would never you know
 
06:48:52.610 --> 06:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
undermine the ability of any
 
06:48:54.530 --> 06:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
organization to be incompetent and
 
06:48:58.250 --> 06:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
wasteful you know so yeah but I I I I
 
06:49:00.288 --> 06:49:00.298 align:start position:0%
don't think that should is the norm
 
06:49:02.628 --> 06:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
normal Norm
 
06:49:05.270 --> 06:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
other other question you know keep in
 
06:49:08.390 --> 06:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
mind if if I may because I think this is
 
06:49:11.410 --> 06:49:11.420 align:start position:0%
relevant those Family Planning clinics
 
06:49:15.350 --> 06:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
that show up with no connection to an
 
06:49:19.250 --> 06:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
abortion Center uh financially or or a
 
06:49:21.070 --> 06:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
physical co-location
 
06:49:24.170 --> 06:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
their audit would be so simple I mean it
 
06:49:26.990 --> 06:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
would be you know minimal minimal to the
 
06:49:30.350 --> 06:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
extent that they got documentation
 
06:49:32.090 --> 06:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:49:34.610 --> 06:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative King thank you Mr
 
06:49:37.430 --> 06:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
chairman it is my strong opinion that
 
06:49:39.650 --> 06:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
all funds are fungible
 
06:49:45.110 --> 06:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
and if the goal here is to stop funding
 
06:49:47.390 --> 06:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
um healthcare providers that also
 
06:49:50.090 --> 06:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
provide abortions why not just get rid
 
06:49:51.770 --> 06:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
of the whole auditing scheme and just
 
06:49:53.868 --> 06:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
say period if you if you have if you
 
06:49:55.910 --> 06:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
fund abortions you don't get any money
 
06:49:58.850 --> 06:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
period and the the whole auditing part
 
06:50:01.368 --> 06:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
of this bill just seems to add like a
 
06:50:02.810 --> 06:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
wrench in the gears
 
06:50:05.030 --> 06:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just it just seems like if
 
06:50:07.548 --> 06:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
the goal is really to just take the
 
06:50:09.708 --> 06:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
abortion money away or a money for
 
06:50:11.090 --> 06:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
abortion I'm not just get rid of the
 
06:50:13.430 --> 06:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
whole auditing thing altogether
 
06:50:16.730 --> 06:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
well I I tell you there's a political
 
06:50:18.890 --> 06:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
calculation in the grand scheme of this
 
06:50:21.468 --> 06:50:21.478 align:start position:0%
but I think from my own sort of feeling
 
06:50:23.270 --> 06:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
of principles the way I would answer
 
06:50:27.230 --> 06:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
that is I would not prejudge any vendor
 
06:50:30.048 --> 06:50:30.058 align:start position:0%
uh I I would just say if you want to
 
06:50:32.390 --> 06:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
compete for these funds here are the
 
06:50:34.788 --> 06:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
rules of our of the road here if you
 
06:50:38.150 --> 06:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
want to comply to make sure that we know
 
06:50:40.250 --> 06:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
that what you've been telling us for
 
06:50:42.650 --> 06:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
years is that there's no commingling I'm
 
06:50:46.070 --> 06:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
happy with that that's the issue we we
 
06:50:49.128 --> 06:50:49.138 align:start position:0%
don't want that co-mingling so
 
06:50:52.448 --> 06:50:52.458 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I I don't want to eliminate
 
06:50:55.070 --> 06:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
the possibility of competition and
 
06:50:57.410 --> 06:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
contribution I just want to make sure
 
06:51:00.170 --> 06:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
that we're clear that we want Family
 
06:51:02.570 --> 06:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
Planning money dedicated to Family
 
06:51:04.730 --> 06:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
Planning services
 
06:51:07.788 --> 06:51:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:10.070 --> 06:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay I see none thank you representative
 
06:51:14.570 --> 06:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:17.030 --> 06:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify today are
 
06:51:19.128 --> 06:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
Patricia Tilley and Meredith Toulouse
 
06:51:21.830 --> 06:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
from Health and Human Services I believe
 
06:51:23.628 --> 06:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh you've asked for five minutes if you
 
06:51:25.070 --> 06:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
can keep it to three I'd really
 
06:51:27.410 --> 06:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate it that's that's what we've
 
06:51:28.968 --> 06:51:28.978 align:start position:0%
been trying to do all day and it's
 
06:51:30.830 --> 06:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
especially given the hour
 
06:51:30.840 --> 06:51:32.750 align:start position:0%
especially given the hour
so

06:51:32.750 --> 06:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:51:34.730 --> 06:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon again for the record
 
06:51:36.468 --> 06:51:36.478 align:start position:0%
Patricia Tilley director of the division
 
06:51:38.330 --> 06:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
of Public Health Services
 
06:51:40.310 --> 06:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
Meredith Talus director of our division
 
06:51:42.590 --> 06:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
of program quality and integrity so
 
06:51:45.170 --> 06:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for this opportunity
 
06:51:47.330 --> 06:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
we were we can go through a couple of
 
06:51:49.368 --> 06:51:49.378 align:start position:0%
the questions or that we've heard from
 
06:51:51.948 --> 06:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
representative Edward's testimony I want
 
06:51:54.170 --> 06:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
to start off by echoing his note that
 
06:51:55.490 --> 06:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Health
 
06:51:57.070 --> 06:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
06:52:00.048 --> 06:52:00.058 align:start position:0%
provides load and no cost sexual and
 
06:52:01.910 --> 06:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care services and
 
06:52:04.368 --> 06:52:04.378 align:start position:0%
information to All Families in Need and
 
06:52:07.090 --> 06:52:07.100 align:start position:0%
these Services include birth control
 
06:52:10.968 --> 06:52:10.978 align:start position:0%
information and supplies annual exams
 
06:52:13.490 --> 06:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
physical exams pregnancy testing
 
06:52:16.548 --> 06:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
referrals to prenatal care testing and
 
06:52:18.048 --> 06:52:18.058 align:start position:0%
treatment for sexually transmitted
 
06:52:21.110 --> 06:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
infections and HIV breast and cervical
 
06:52:23.330 --> 06:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
cancer screening basic infertility
 
06:52:26.390 --> 06:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
Services as well as help in planning for
 
06:52:29.930 --> 06:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
pregnancies the funding that we use in
 
06:52:30.890 --> 06:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
06:52:32.690 --> 06:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
Services is something called title 10
 
06:52:34.910 --> 06:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
funding it is federal funding that is
 
06:52:37.128 --> 06:52:37.138 align:start position:0%
the the bolus of the funds that
 
06:52:39.590 --> 06:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards was was referring
 
06:52:42.830 --> 06:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
to in both state both in federal statute
 
06:52:45.350 --> 06:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
as well as in state policy none of those
 
06:52:47.208 --> 06:52:47.218 align:start position:0%
funds can be used for abortion services
 
06:52:50.570 --> 06:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
that has been the case for the more than
 
06:52:53.448 --> 06:52:53.458 align:start position:0%
um over 50 years of title 10 it's
 
06:52:55.968 --> 06:52:55.978 align:start position:0%
roughly the same age as me
 
06:52:58.128 --> 06:52:58.138 align:start position:0%
um in a course so we just wanted to make
 
06:52:59.868 --> 06:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody had that lay of The
 
06:53:02.208 --> 06:53:02.218 align:start position:0%
Land Before We Begin currently the
 
06:53:04.310 --> 06:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
department has contracts with four
 
06:53:06.890 --> 06:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
Health Centers to provide these Family
 
06:53:09.350 --> 06:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
Planning Services those are msk Health
 
06:53:12.170 --> 06:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
Belknap Merrimack Community Action
 
06:53:14.390 --> 06:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
Program kowas County family health
 
06:53:17.030 --> 06:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
services and Lamprey Health Care the
 
06:53:19.310 --> 06:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
department currently does not have any
 
06:53:20.750 --> 06:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
contracts with reproductive Health
 
06:53:25.128 --> 06:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
Facilities as defined in RSA 13237 again
 
06:53:27.350 --> 06:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
that definition was developed by policy
 
06:53:29.868 --> 06:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
makers to describe entities that provide
 
06:53:31.910 --> 06:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
abortion Services I think representative
 
06:53:34.010 --> 06:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
Edwards did a nice job representing the
 
06:53:35.448 --> 06:53:35.458 align:start position:0%
issues that we've had in getting
 
06:53:37.610 --> 06:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
contracts passed through our executive
 
06:53:39.230 --> 06:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
Council but I do want to make it clear
 
06:53:41.750 --> 06:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we currently have four vendors that
 
06:53:43.610 --> 06:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
are doing incredible work in our
 
06:53:45.548 --> 06:53:45.558 align:start position:0%
community providing low income
 
06:53:47.750 --> 06:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
individuals with access to birth control
 
06:53:50.690 --> 06:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
birth control and other services
 
06:53:52.968 --> 06:53:52.978 align:start position:0%
what we would like to note in this bill
 
06:53:56.030 --> 06:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
is that hb615 introduces some
 
06:53:58.070 --> 06:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
unidentified terms so I think we've
 
06:53:59.270 --> 06:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
already heard that again from
 
06:54:01.490 --> 06:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards testimony we have
 
06:54:03.830 --> 06:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
one term in there called Family Planning
 
06:54:07.490 --> 06:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
projects it's unclear in reading this
 
06:54:10.490 --> 06:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
who that refers to does that refer to
 
06:54:12.468 --> 06:54:12.478 align:start position:0%
anyone that provides Family Planning
 
06:54:14.330 --> 06:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
services in the state does that require
 
06:54:16.670 --> 06:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
refer to those that we have a
 
06:54:18.650 --> 06:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship which is what I
 
06:54:20.990 --> 06:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
think I heard representative Edwards
 
06:54:23.810 --> 06:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
clarify so that's helpful we just needed
 
06:54:25.310 --> 06:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
to understand before we could understand
 
06:54:27.590 --> 06:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
the scope of this bill is who are these
 
06:54:30.468 --> 06:54:30.478 align:start position:0%
Family Planning contracts projects I
 
06:54:32.170 --> 06:54:32.180 align:start position:0%
think the other
 
06:54:34.430 --> 06:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
undefined terms we also just heard about
 
06:54:37.128 --> 06:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
were both the financial and Geographic
 
06:54:38.868 --> 06:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
connection to a reproductive Health Care
 
06:54:41.208 --> 06:54:41.218 align:start position:0%
Facility again representative Edwards
 
06:54:44.868 --> 06:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
did a nice job to talk about the um what
 
06:54:46.190 --> 06:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
could be misunderstood with the
 
06:54:48.170 --> 06:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
geographic connection I mean one when I
 
06:54:50.330 --> 06:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
first read that I thought is that a
 
06:54:52.548 --> 06:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
provider in the same town as someone
 
06:54:54.288 --> 06:54:54.298 align:start position:0%
who's in a reproductive Health has a
 
06:54:56.690 --> 06:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care Facility and I
 
06:54:58.670 --> 06:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
we understood that clearly probably was
 
06:55:00.890 --> 06:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
not the response or the answer so I
 
06:55:02.690 --> 06:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
think getting some clarity around that
 
06:55:04.910 --> 06:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
within the context of this build would
 
06:55:06.890 --> 06:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
be remarkably helpful and again
 
06:55:09.830 --> 06:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
narrowing it down to financial
 
06:55:13.010 --> 06:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
um connections you know as noted
 
06:55:14.690 --> 06:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
um Meredith Toulouse and she can talk
 
06:55:17.530 --> 06:55:17.540 align:start position:0%
more about this we as the department
 
06:55:20.990 --> 06:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
went through and did Financial reviews
 
06:55:23.930 --> 06:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
of all of our vendors at the time who
 
06:55:26.448 --> 06:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
were up for a contract who had bid for a
 
06:55:28.368 --> 06:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
contract that includes both reproductive
 
06:55:30.170 --> 06:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities those entities
 
06:55:31.910 --> 06:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
that provide family planning services
 
06:55:34.910 --> 06:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
and abortion as well as our other
 
06:55:36.650 --> 06:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
community health centers that just apply
 
06:55:39.590 --> 06:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
Family Planning Services the result of
 
06:55:42.770 --> 06:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
that review was that there was no mixing
 
06:55:44.628 --> 06:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
of funds that the funds were used
 
06:55:46.548 --> 06:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
appropriately by state and federal
 
06:55:49.610 --> 06:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
statute that was identified mostly by
 
06:55:52.430 --> 06:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
using times studies and other ways to
 
06:55:54.410 --> 06:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
make sure that if that dollar the state
 
06:55:57.110 --> 06:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
is pay is provided goes to this service
 
06:55:59.090 --> 06:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
we could follow that to the best of our
 
06:56:01.070 --> 06:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
ability and I'll just
 
06:56:03.170 --> 06:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
um uh finalize right now before I hand
 
06:56:05.868 --> 06:56:05.878 align:start position:0%
it over to Meredith that we are
 
06:56:08.750 --> 06:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about additional barriers and
 
06:56:11.390 --> 06:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
costly expense to our very fragile
 
06:56:13.430 --> 06:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
system of reproductive Health Care in
 
06:56:16.070 --> 06:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
the state this is fundamental Primary
 
06:56:19.788 --> 06:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
Care for Women as well as men to be able
 
06:56:21.770 --> 06:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
to have access to all of those screening
 
06:56:24.590 --> 06:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
services and contraception our health
 
06:56:26.930 --> 06:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
centers that we work with are really
 
06:56:30.350 --> 06:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
walking a fine line right now and we are
 
06:56:32.270 --> 06:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
concerned that by adding additional
 
06:56:34.490 --> 06:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
barriers and additional costs to their
 
06:56:36.948 --> 06:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
work we will no longer have a safety net
 
06:56:39.350 --> 06:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
of providers for low-income individuals
 
06:56:41.570 --> 06:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
so I'll ask Meredith if she is thank you
 
06:56:43.310 --> 06:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
and again you're over the three minutes
 
06:56:45.468 --> 06:56:45.478 align:start position:0%
already but I'll give you some time
 
06:56:48.590 --> 06:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
director chose appreciate that uh Mr
 
06:56:50.270 --> 06:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
chair so you can do it a minute in a
 
06:56:51.590 --> 06:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
minute and a half I'd really appreciate
 
06:56:53.990 --> 06:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
it I will talk fast I only have a couple
 
06:56:55.430 --> 06:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
points to make
 
06:56:57.770 --> 06:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
um one just to
 
06:57:00.650 --> 06:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
um uh follow up on representative Weber
 
06:57:03.468 --> 06:57:03.478 align:start position:0%
Weber's question and and representative
 
06:57:05.628 --> 06:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
Edwards sponsor sponsor Edward's
 
06:57:05.638 --> 06:57:06.650 align:start position:0%
Edwards sponsor sponsor Edward's
response

06:57:06.650 --> 06:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
response
 
06:57:09.468 --> 06:57:09.478 align:start position:0%
um there is a bit of a chicken egg and
 
06:57:12.410 --> 06:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
we faced that actually this year when we
 
06:57:13.968 --> 06:57:13.978 align:start position:0%
went to look at the language of House
 
06:57:16.910 --> 06:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 and consider bringing new
 
06:57:18.830 --> 06:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
contracts forward at the end of fiscal
 
06:57:21.770 --> 06:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
year uh 2022 we realized that we did not
 
06:57:23.810 --> 06:57:23.820 align:start position:0%
have any reviews to do because none of
 
06:57:25.810 --> 06:57:25.820 align:start position:0%
the reproductive health facilities
 
06:57:28.548 --> 06:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
had been awarded a contract previously
 
06:57:32.270 --> 06:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
so that may be a a language barrier that
 
06:57:33.830 --> 06:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be resolved in the bill to meet
 
06:57:36.708 --> 06:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
the intent the other point that I would
 
06:57:40.250 --> 06:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
make is that it it does appear that the
 
06:57:42.590 --> 06:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
requirement here is for an independent
 
06:57:44.448 --> 06:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
audit which we assumed in our fiscal
 
06:57:48.170 --> 06:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
note would be would be done by a um by
 
06:57:51.288 --> 06:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
the hired by the facility or the
 
06:57:54.048 --> 06:57:54.058 align:start position:0%
contractor not by the department and
 
06:57:57.110 --> 06:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
then completed by a third party but the
 
06:57:58.910 --> 06:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
language of the bill still mirrors some
 
06:58:01.010 --> 06:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
of what was in-house Bill 2 which
 
06:58:02.750 --> 06:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
required certification by the department
 
06:58:07.190 --> 06:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
but if if a audit is being done by an
 
06:58:09.530 --> 06:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
independent auditor and it's being
 
06:58:11.330 --> 06:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
completed and it's being presented by
 
06:58:13.430 --> 06:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
the by the to the vendor and to governor
 
06:58:15.468 --> 06:58:15.478 align:start position:0%
and Council there's no longer really a
 
06:58:17.390 --> 06:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
role for the Department to play at that
 
06:58:19.368 --> 06:58:19.378 align:start position:0%
point because I wouldn't really certify
 
06:58:22.128 --> 06:58:22.138 align:start position:0%
another entity's work or the audit that
 
06:58:24.230 --> 06:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
they had completed
 
06:58:27.288 --> 06:58:27.298 align:start position:0%
I bet I finished in a minute thank you I
 
06:58:28.850 --> 06:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually timing you but it sounds
 
06:58:28.860 --> 06:58:29.930 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually timing you but it sounds
tight

06:58:29.930 --> 06:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
tight
 
06:58:31.910 --> 06:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
any questions for these ladies yes I
 
06:58:35.810 --> 06:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:38.030 --> 06:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you a question that I
 
06:58:41.030 --> 06:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
asked before uh do you have any idea
 
06:58:42.890 --> 06:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
because you're more professionally
 
06:58:45.128 --> 06:58:45.138 align:start position:0%
involved in this kind of work
 
06:58:48.110 --> 06:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
what such an audit such an independent
 
06:58:51.650 --> 06:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
audit might cost and whether or not you
 
06:58:54.708 --> 06:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
can tell me how much it costs isn't that
 
06:58:57.650 --> 06:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
cost going to come out of the monies
 
06:59:00.708 --> 06:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
that we really would rather have spent
 
06:59:04.548 --> 06:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
on actually providing services to a
 
06:59:06.948 --> 06:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population
 
06:59:10.548 --> 06:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
it it could cost any amount
 
06:59:13.548 --> 06:59:13.558 align:start position:0%
um depending upon what vendor is found
 
06:59:14.750 --> 06:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
to complete the work but if we're
 
06:59:15.830 --> 06:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
talking about certified public
 
06:59:19.730 --> 06:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
accountants they make more than uh what
 
06:59:21.288 --> 06:59:21.298 align:start position:0%
many of my staff at the department make
 
06:59:24.170 --> 06:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that it probably cost
 
06:59:24.180 --> 06:59:25.368 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that it probably cost
us

06:59:25.368 --> 06:59:25.378 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:59:27.830 --> 06:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
um maybe around eight to ten thousand
 
06:59:30.770 --> 06:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
dollars per vendor as we were doing our
 
06:59:32.230 --> 06:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
own reviews
 
06:59:35.208 --> 06:59:35.218 align:start position:0%
this work I would estimate is going to
 
06:59:37.190 --> 06:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
be more costly one because again we're
 
06:59:38.690 --> 06:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
probably talking about
 
06:59:38.700 --> 06:59:40.010 align:start position:0%
probably talking about
um

06:59:40.010 --> 06:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:42.170 --> 06:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
um people who are who are making more
 
06:59:44.270 --> 06:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
and there's more overhead because
 
06:59:46.548 --> 06:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
they're working for a private firm and
 
06:59:50.030 --> 06:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
two it's it's an it's an audit whereas
 
06:59:52.968 --> 06:59:52.978 align:start position:0%
we were asked to certify in a targeted
 
06:59:55.730 --> 06:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
way that none of the money provided for
 
06:59:57.350 --> 06:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
our contracts was used to subsidize
 
06:59:59.208 --> 06:59:59.218 align:start position:0%
abortion either directly or indirectly
 
07:00:01.190 --> 07:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
so we might have been more narrowly
 
07:00:03.830 --> 07:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
scoped and and I'll just suggest that I
 
07:00:05.030 --> 07:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
believe that there are some speakers
 
07:00:06.650 --> 07:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
after us from our health centers who
 
07:00:09.410 --> 07:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
probably can answer that question
 
07:00:13.730 --> 07:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:15.830 --> 07:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
so I think the whole purpose of this
 
07:00:18.650 --> 07:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
audit is basically an accountability
 
07:00:21.948 --> 07:00:21.958 align:start position:0%
is what would be a cheaper or a another
 
07:00:27.770 --> 07:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:30.230 --> 07:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that when you say
 
07:00:33.048 --> 07:00:33.058 align:start position:0%
accountability accountability for the
 
07:00:35.810 --> 07:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
vendors to show how the money is being
 
07:00:39.410 --> 07:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:42.110 --> 07:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
I think that perhaps that the lowest
 
07:00:44.208 --> 07:00:44.218 align:start position:0%
cost option was the one pursued the
 
07:00:45.468 --> 07:00:45.478 align:start position:0%
first time which was for the Department
 
07:00:47.930 --> 07:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
to do the review which we did and we
 
07:00:49.570 --> 07:00:49.580 align:start position:0%
provided the reviews
 
07:00:53.868 --> 07:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
in October of 2021 and at the time those
 
07:00:55.490 --> 07:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
found that
 
07:00:58.490 --> 07:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
the money provided through our contracts
 
07:01:02.030 --> 07:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
did not fully compensate the vendors for
 
07:01:04.070 --> 07:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
the Family Planning work and if we
 
07:01:05.810 --> 07:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
weren't fully compensating for the work
 
07:01:08.448 --> 07:01:08.458 align:start position:0%
within our own contracts there's no way
 
07:01:10.670 --> 07:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
we could be funding any other services
 
07:01:13.910 --> 07:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
provided by those vendors and and I will
 
07:01:15.890 --> 07:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
just add to that that even prior to
 
07:01:18.110 --> 07:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
those Financial reviews it has always
 
07:01:20.390 --> 07:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
been the policy both federal and state
 
07:01:22.190 --> 07:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
policy to have strict contract
 
07:01:25.310 --> 07:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring of all of the providers for
 
07:01:28.128 --> 07:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
again more than 50 years
 
07:01:32.690 --> 07:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:35.030 --> 07:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you thank
 
07:01:35.040 --> 07:01:39.110 align:start position:0%

serving New Hampshire citizens for over
 
07:02:43.788 --> 07:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
42 years we are historically proud
 
07:02:45.230 --> 07:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
partners with the Department of Health
 
07:02:47.390 --> 07:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
and Human Services for the provision of
 
07:02:49.190 --> 07:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
Family Planning Services Under the title
 
07:02:51.110 --> 07:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
10 Family Planning contracts
 
07:02:52.548 --> 07:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
we are one of the reproductive
 
07:02:54.288 --> 07:02:54.298 align:start position:0%
Healthcare facilities or independent
 
07:02:55.968 --> 07:02:55.978 align:start position:0%
abortion clinics which we do not shy
 
07:02:58.430 --> 07:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
away from saying directly impacted by
 
07:03:00.410 --> 07:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
house bill 615.
 
07:03:02.510 --> 07:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
as Written House Bill 615 is
 
07:03:04.850 --> 07:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
non-specific and allows for significant
 
07:03:07.010 --> 07:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
subjectivity in its interpretation of
 
07:03:09.530 --> 07:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
vital language it's unclear who Bears
 
07:03:11.030 --> 07:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the cost of the
 
07:03:12.590 --> 07:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
required independent audits although
 
07:03:14.690 --> 07:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
some of that may have been clarified in
 
07:03:16.788 --> 07:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
testimony before me and for reasons
 
07:03:19.128 --> 07:03:19.138 align:start position:0%
discussed in my written testimony audits
 
07:03:20.990 --> 07:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
described in the house bill 615 are
 
07:03:23.868 --> 07:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
impractical unnecessary and still left
 
07:03:25.548 --> 07:03:25.558 align:start position:0%
to subjective interpretation and
 
07:03:28.190 --> 07:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
inconsistent application of remedies
 
07:03:30.708 --> 07:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
it's unclear what may be considered as a
 
07:03:32.690 --> 07:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
satisfactory audit or what constitutes
 
07:03:35.570 --> 07:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
indirectly subsidizing abortion care
 
07:03:38.570 --> 07:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
physical or geographical segregation of
 
07:03:40.310 --> 07:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
Family Planning services from abortion
 
07:03:42.350 --> 07:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
care is not required under current law
 
07:03:46.310 --> 07:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
including 2021's House Bill 2 and it is
 
07:03:48.350 --> 07:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
not how health care is provided in the
 
07:03:49.850 --> 07:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
07:03:52.010 --> 07:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 615 inappropriately
 
07:03:54.650 --> 07:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
introduces the opportunity to enforce a
 
07:03:56.750 --> 07:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
physical separation of services
 
07:03:58.788 --> 07:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
discussions at the executive Council
 
07:04:00.590 --> 07:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
that led to the denial of Family
 
07:04:02.750 --> 07:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
Planning contracts to the lovering in
 
07:04:05.990 --> 07:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
2021 and 2022 can be interpreted as
 
07:04:07.910 --> 07:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
requiring nothing short of physical
 
07:04:10.610 --> 07:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
separation of services it is not an
 
07:04:13.310 --> 07:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
overstatement to say that as written for
 
07:04:14.990 --> 07:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
any reproductive Health Clinic who
 
07:04:16.910 --> 07:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
attempted to re-enter the program House
 
07:04:20.390 --> 07:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 615 is likely to be used to enforce
 
07:04:22.548 --> 07:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
that requirement or make participation
 
07:04:22.558 --> 07:04:24.110 align:start position:0%
that requirement or make participation
impossible

07:04:24.110 --> 07:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
07:04:26.690 --> 07:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
I ask you to consider the segregation of
 
07:04:29.090 --> 07:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
services which is the action or state of
 
07:04:30.890 --> 07:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
setting someone or something apart from
 
07:04:33.048 --> 07:04:33.058 align:start position:0%
others that cannot be realistically
 
07:04:34.968 --> 07:04:34.978 align:start position:0%
accomplished without impacting the
 
07:04:37.310 --> 07:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
lowest income and vulnerable citizens in
 
07:04:38.330 --> 07:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
our state
 
07:04:40.190 --> 07:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
segregation of services always
 
07:04:42.590 --> 07:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
segregates people
 
07:04:44.150 --> 07:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
adding barriers to receiving
 
07:04:46.510 --> 07:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive care exacerbating
 
07:04:48.650 --> 07:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
long-standing inequities in health care
 
07:04:50.930 --> 07:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
and further disenfranchising the very
 
07:04:52.910 --> 07:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
citizens the program is designed to
 
07:04:56.030 --> 07:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
serve legal abortion is part of the
 
07:04:58.128 --> 07:04:58.138 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care Continuum in
 
07:05:01.610 --> 07:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it can be and is legally
 
07:05:04.250 --> 07:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
and responsibly provided alongside title
 
07:05:05.810 --> 07:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
10 Family Planning contracts under
 
07:05:08.628 --> 07:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
current law there is a vast difference
 
07:05:11.390 --> 07:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
between ensuring responsible fiscal
 
07:05:13.610 --> 07:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
separation of publicly funded services
 
07:05:17.090 --> 07:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
from abortion services and the desire to
 
07:05:19.788 --> 07:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
permanently or temporarily deny public
 
07:05:22.250 --> 07:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
funds to abortion providers
 
07:05:25.128 --> 07:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
if the intent of House Bill 615 is the
 
07:05:27.530 --> 07:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
latter to deny public funds to abortion
 
07:05:30.230 --> 07:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
providers House Bill 615 remains an
 
07:05:32.750 --> 07:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
irresponsibly subjected piece of
 
07:05:35.150 --> 07:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
legislation to achieve that goal and it
 
07:05:37.250 --> 07:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
risks access to vital services for your
 
07:05:40.250 --> 07:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
constituents across our state thank you
 
07:05:42.048 --> 07:05:42.058 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:05:42.058 --> 07:05:46.788 align:start position:0%
thank you
questions

07:05:46.788 --> 07:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:49.670 --> 07:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
nice oh I'm representative Nagel
 
07:05:51.530 --> 07:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
07:05:52.850 --> 07:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:05:55.030 --> 07:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
um access seems to be a huge issue here
 
07:05:57.770 --> 07:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
especially in the vulnerable
 
07:06:00.410 --> 07:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like you're not getting a
 
07:06:02.510 --> 07:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
contract created a big hole who's filled
 
07:06:05.030 --> 07:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:07.788 --> 07:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
at a program level nobody has filled
 
07:06:10.070 --> 07:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
that hole so my understanding is that
 
07:06:11.810 --> 07:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
the current contracts in the Family
 
07:06:13.850 --> 07:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
Planning program at the state level were
 
07:06:16.670 --> 07:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
previous contractors and there has not
 
07:06:18.288 --> 07:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
been a significant addition of new
 
07:06:18.298 --> 07:06:19.850 align:start position:0%
been a significant addition of new
contractors

07:06:19.850 --> 07:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
07:06:21.410 --> 07:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
to the program
 
07:06:22.788 --> 07:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
07:06:26.930 --> 07:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:32.330 --> 07:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:34.610 --> 07:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm assuming
 
07:06:36.948 --> 07:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
um Ms Pascal that the other person you
 
07:06:39.850 --> 07:06:39.860 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak was Greg White yes
 
07:06:43.720 --> 07:06:43.730 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:43.730 --> 07:06:45.948 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
07:06:47.628 --> 07:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
07:06:48.890 --> 07:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
of the committee I thank you for your
 
07:06:51.110 --> 07:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
time my name is Gregory white I'm the
 
07:06:52.610 --> 07:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
Chief Executive Officer of Lamprey
 
07:06:55.010 --> 07:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
Healthcare we are a federally qualified
 
07:06:57.530 --> 07:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
Health Center with sites in Nashua New
 
07:06:59.150 --> 07:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
Market and Raymond as well as a mobile
 
07:07:01.310 --> 07:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
health unit and a number of integrated
 
07:07:04.548 --> 07:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
care sites we are a primary care
 
07:07:07.670 --> 07:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
provider and we are also a family
 
07:07:10.128 --> 07:07:10.138 align:start position:0%
planning contractor others have
 
07:07:11.990 --> 07:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier in their testimony the
 
07:07:13.548 --> 07:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
services that we provide so I won't
 
07:07:16.070 --> 07:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
repeat them I would just like to point
 
07:07:17.510 --> 07:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
out I think that we're caught up in some
 
07:07:19.448 --> 07:07:19.458 align:start position:0%
of the language issues that others have
 
07:07:22.368 --> 07:07:22.378 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier in the face of this I
 
07:07:24.368 --> 07:07:24.378 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that as an fqhc
 
07:07:26.810 --> 07:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
we are subject to What's called the Hyde
 
07:07:28.430 --> 07:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment that the federal level and are
 
07:07:30.170 --> 07:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
precluded from providing abortion
 
07:07:33.350 --> 07:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
Services we do not
 
07:07:35.330 --> 07:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
we have repeatedly been required to
 
07:07:37.730 --> 07:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
attest to this fact to the state we have
 
07:07:39.730 --> 07:07:39.740 align:start position:0%
participated in the state fiscal reviews
 
07:07:42.288 --> 07:07:42.298 align:start position:0%
as a recipient of state and federal
 
07:07:44.448 --> 07:07:44.458 align:start position:0%
grants and contracts we are subject to
 
07:07:47.150 --> 07:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
annual Financial audit we are subject to
 
07:07:48.590 --> 07:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
annual audit in accordance with
 
07:07:50.868 --> 07:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
governing government auditing standards
 
07:07:54.048 --> 07:07:54.058 align:start position:0%
we have two separate program Audits and
 
07:07:55.850 --> 07:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
we have site visits to review our
 
07:07:58.430 --> 07:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
compliance from the State Department of
 
07:07:59.930 --> 07:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
Public Health or excuse in the
 
07:08:02.208 --> 07:08:02.218 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
07:08:04.368 --> 07:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
we spend in excess of fifty thousand
 
07:08:07.330 --> 07:08:07.340 align:start position:0%
dollars every year on our Audits
 
07:08:09.890 --> 07:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
and that pales in comparison the amount
 
07:08:12.048 --> 07:08:12.058 align:start position:0%
of staff time it takes to prepare for
 
07:08:14.570 --> 07:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
and participate in these processes
 
07:08:16.968 --> 07:08:16.978 align:start position:0%
we have had a quote from our auditing
 
07:08:19.850 --> 07:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
firm and independent firm that such an
 
07:08:21.650 --> 07:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
auditing requirement such as we're
 
07:08:23.270 --> 07:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
discussing here might cost us another
 
07:08:26.350 --> 07:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
two to ten thousand dollars
 
07:08:29.990 --> 07:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
my concerns here mainly are this is
 
07:08:33.708 --> 07:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
redundant it's not necessary and um
 
07:08:36.048 --> 07:08:36.058 align:start position:0%
crushing administrative burden on some
 
07:08:38.810 --> 07:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
very scant resources so I'll keep my
 
07:08:41.628 --> 07:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
remarks brief out of respect for your
 
07:08:41.638 --> 07:08:43.430 align:start position:0%
remarks brief out of respect for your
time

07:08:43.430 --> 07:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
07:08:46.968 --> 07:08:46.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:49.430 --> 07:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative King thank you Mr
 
07:08:49.440 --> 07:08:50.448 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative King thank you Mr
chair

07:08:50.448 --> 07:08:50.458 align:start position:0%
chair
 
07:08:53.150 --> 07:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
you don't perform abortions at your
 
07:08:55.968 --> 07:08:55.978 align:start position:0%
facility and yet you're still having to
 
07:08:59.330 --> 07:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
do some sort of audits to attest to the
 
07:09:00.890 --> 07:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
fact that money is received from the
 
07:09:02.990 --> 07:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
states don't go towards abortion is that
 
07:09:05.270 --> 07:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
correct the process that was uh
 
07:09:07.610 --> 07:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
delineated earlier today uh earlier
 
07:09:09.770 --> 07:09:09.780 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony excuse me we were part
 
07:09:10.910 --> 07:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
of that we are one of the state
 
07:09:13.010 --> 07:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
contractors so yes that we were part of
 
07:09:13.020 --> 07:09:14.868 align:start position:0%
contractors so yes that we were part of
that

07:09:14.868 --> 07:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:09:17.208 --> 07:09:17.218 align:start position:0%
so we attest to that each year
 
07:09:19.250 --> 07:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
and it still costs all that money just
 
07:09:20.810 --> 07:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
to just to show that you guys don't
 
07:09:22.850 --> 07:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
spend any money on abortions that would
 
07:09:25.070 --> 07:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
cost us more money according to what was
 
07:09:26.628 --> 07:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
being proposed here today we already
 
07:09:29.510 --> 07:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
have an audit so it feels as if this is
 
07:09:33.110 --> 07:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
redundant okay thank you
 
07:09:37.730 --> 07:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:39.170 --> 07:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
I represent the other representative
 
07:09:39.180 --> 07:09:41.448 align:start position:0%
I represent the other representative
King

07:09:41.448 --> 07:09:41.458 align:start position:0%
King
 
07:09:44.150 --> 07:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
getting sandwiched
 
07:09:44.160 --> 07:09:44.990 align:start position:0%
getting sandwiched
um

07:09:44.990 --> 07:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:47.150 --> 07:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you the same question I
 
07:09:50.150 --> 07:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
asked the last group and that is if if
 
07:09:53.510 --> 07:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
you don't audit how do we know that the
 
07:09:58.190 --> 07:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:01.010 --> 07:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
so we are audited and we attest that it
 
07:10:03.048 --> 07:10:03.058 align:start position:0%
is being used responsibly I can attest
 
07:10:04.730 --> 07:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
to you every year we do not provide
 
07:10:07.910 --> 07:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
those services in question were we to do
 
07:10:09.830 --> 07:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
so we would lose our federal designation
 
07:10:11.810 --> 07:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
which would effectively put us out of
 
07:10:11.820 --> 07:10:13.788 align:start position:0%
which would effectively put us out of
business

07:10:13.788 --> 07:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
business
 
07:10:13.798 --> 07:10:15.830 align:start position:0%
business
follow-up

07:10:15.830 --> 07:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
07:10:17.690 --> 07:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
I think what's at stake here is taking
 
07:10:21.170 --> 07:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
the audit out of the the solution
 
07:10:23.810 --> 07:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
so if there is no audit how do we
 
07:10:27.350 --> 07:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
maintain the accountability
 
07:10:29.208 --> 07:10:29.218 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to attest to the fact
 
07:10:30.530 --> 07:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
that we are not delivering those
 
07:10:32.868 --> 07:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
Services sir
 
07:10:35.208 --> 07:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you representative
 
07:10:35.218 --> 07:10:38.868 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you representative
Weber

07:10:38.868 --> 07:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:41.390 --> 07:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
and just to be abundantly clear
 
07:10:44.448 --> 07:10:44.458 align:start position:0%
the proposed audit here is an audit on
 
07:10:46.390 --> 07:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
top of the audit that you're already
 
07:10:49.368 --> 07:10:49.378 align:start position:0%
being audited by is that correct there
 
07:10:52.548 --> 07:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
all is already an audit every year there
 
07:10:54.590 --> 07:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
is a financial audit every year I am
 
07:10:56.750 --> 07:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
unclear as to what the process would
 
07:10:58.310 --> 07:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
involve for the audit that's being
 
07:11:00.110 --> 07:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
proposed but yes it would be in addition
 
07:11:00.120 --> 07:11:02.810 align:start position:0%
proposed but yes it would be in addition
to

07:11:02.810 --> 07:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:06.288 --> 07:11:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:08.330 --> 07:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
okay I think we're all set thank you
 
07:11:11.390 --> 07:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:15.288 --> 07:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
and uh now uh I think Ms Pascal
 
07:11:18.590 --> 07:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
are you ready is this a good sign
 
07:11:20.570 --> 07:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:11:22.490 --> 07:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm here for Christine
 
07:11:24.708 --> 07:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
Stoddard from Bi-State Primary Care
 
07:11:27.410 --> 07:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you sir okay um who represents all
 
07:11:29.990 --> 07:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
the health centers and I I will be very
 
07:11:32.628 --> 07:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
brief because our points are to do with
 
07:11:34.788 --> 07:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
cost and access to care which I think
 
07:11:37.128 --> 07:11:37.138 align:start position:0%
Patricia Kelly Tilly and Meredith
 
07:11:39.048 --> 07:11:39.058 align:start position:0%
Toulouse and our health centers have
 
07:11:41.170 --> 07:11:41.180 align:start position:0%
covered adequately so I will hand out
 
07:11:44.510 --> 07:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
Christine's testimony and I hope you
 
07:11:46.548 --> 07:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
have no questions for me I hope they
 
07:11:48.650 --> 07:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
were all answered by our health centers
 
07:11:50.208 --> 07:11:50.218 align:start position:0%
all right do you want to Define any
 
07:11:52.850 --> 07:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
questions then in the event of irony or
 
07:11:54.410 --> 07:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
are there any questions I guess that's
 
07:11:55.610 --> 07:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
the quest
 
07:12:07.190 --> 07:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:09.110 --> 07:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
while she's doing that
 
07:12:11.570 --> 07:12:11.580 align:start position:0%

support of house bill 615.
uh

07:12:46.128 --> 07:12:46.138 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:12:48.708 --> 07:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
as you already know from my previous
 
07:12:48.718 --> 07:12:50.208 align:start position:0%
as you already know from my previous
testimony

07:12:50.208 --> 07:12:50.218 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
07:12:51.948 --> 07:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
we consider
 
07:12:51.958 --> 07:12:56.330 align:start position:0%
we consider
um

07:12:56.330 --> 07:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:58.730 --> 07:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
abortion to be a violation of
 
07:13:01.610 --> 07:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
fundamental human rights and as such we
 
07:13:03.110 --> 07:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
07:13:05.570 --> 07:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
to use taxpayer dollars to support that
 
07:13:06.830 --> 07:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
07:13:08.510 --> 07:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
is a violation of the rights of
 
07:13:10.250 --> 07:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
conscience of every taxpayer who
 
07:13:12.530 --> 07:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
believes the way we do
 
07:13:12.540 --> 07:13:19.368 align:start position:0%
believes the way we do
and

07:13:19.368 --> 07:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:20.990 --> 07:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're aware
 
07:13:24.230 --> 07:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
of many cases
 
07:13:26.930 --> 07:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
where the largest abortion provider in
 
07:13:29.030 --> 07:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
our country
 
07:13:29.040 --> 07:13:30.948 align:start position:0%
our country
has

07:13:30.948 --> 07:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
has
 
07:13:30.958 --> 07:13:32.448 align:start position:0%
has
has

07:13:32.448 --> 07:13:32.458 align:start position:0%
has
 
07:13:32.458 --> 07:13:34.850 align:start position:0%
has
agreed

07:13:34.850 --> 07:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
07:13:38.030 --> 07:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
that they have misappropriated funds
 
07:13:43.610 --> 07:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:47.750 --> 07:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
toward the performance of abortion
 
07:13:47.760 --> 07:13:49.430 align:start position:0%
toward the performance of abortion
and

07:13:49.430 --> 07:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:13:52.010 --> 07:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
from testimony of people who have run
 
07:13:55.490 --> 07:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood clinics
 
07:13:58.788 --> 07:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:02.330 --> 07:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
so we think this uh independent audit is
 
07:14:02.340 --> 07:14:03.650 align:start position:0%
so we think this uh independent audit is
necessary

07:14:03.650 --> 07:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
07:14:06.468 --> 07:14:06.478 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons independent is
 
07:14:10.250 --> 07:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
important to us
 
07:14:11.868 --> 07:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
is that all these other clinics are
 
07:14:14.150 --> 07:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
going the same excuses the same ones you
 
07:14:16.548 --> 07:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
hear Within These Walls over and over
 
07:14:18.468 --> 07:14:18.478 align:start position:0%
and over oh we're audited this way in
 
07:14:20.690 --> 07:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
that way in six ways from Sunday
 
07:14:22.670 --> 07:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
07:14:24.830 --> 07:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
a Planned Parenthood say oh yeah well we
 
07:14:26.868 --> 07:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
did misappropriate nine million dollars
 
07:14:28.730 --> 07:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
07:14:31.730 --> 07:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
and uh but those are never convicted now
 
07:14:33.530 --> 07:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
they never get convicted
 
07:14:36.650 --> 07:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
because they always always plead
 
07:14:36.660 --> 07:14:37.968 align:start position:0%
because they always always plead
and

07:14:37.968 --> 07:14:37.978 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:14:41.570 --> 07:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
they have non-disclosure agreements
 
07:14:43.670 --> 07:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
we also know that roughly 90 percent of
 
07:14:44.930 --> 07:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
the people who under a Planned
 
07:14:46.368 --> 07:14:46.378 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and that's the only one for
 
07:14:48.288 --> 07:14:48.298 align:start position:0%
which we have information from their own
 
07:14:49.730 --> 07:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
annual reports
 
07:14:52.730 --> 07:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
seeking Pregnancy Services
 
07:14:55.730 --> 07:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
end up with abortions
 
07:14:58.610 --> 07:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's hard to sit here and say to you
 
07:15:00.830 --> 07:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
oh I believe they can do that with
 
07:15:03.288 --> 07:15:03.298 align:start position:0%
totally separating their funds none of
 
07:15:05.448 --> 07:15:05.458 align:start position:0%
the money that you give them as we've
 
07:15:07.730 --> 07:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
heard none of the fungible money that
 
07:15:10.910 --> 07:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
you give them gets directed toward
 
07:15:13.730 --> 07:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
supporting abortion
 
07:15:16.250 --> 07:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
so that's it
 
07:15:19.670 --> 07:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr welper
 
07:15:21.650 --> 07:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
any questions uh yes representative
 
07:15:21.660 --> 07:15:23.270 align:start position:0%
any questions uh yes representative

07:15:23.270 --> 07:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
07:15:25.368 --> 07:15:25.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
07:15:25.378 --> 07:15:26.868 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

07:15:26.868 --> 07:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:29.030 --> 07:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass and be signed
 
07:15:31.250 --> 07:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
into law and
 
07:15:33.650 --> 07:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
um an independent
 
07:15:36.708 --> 07:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
audit was done which showed no
 
07:15:39.230 --> 07:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
co-mingling of funds would you and your
 
07:15:41.448 --> 07:15:41.458 align:start position:0%
organization support
 
07:15:41.458 --> 07:15:42.048 align:start position:0%
organization support
um

07:15:42.048 --> 07:15:42.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:44.090 --> 07:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
allowing these organizations to have
 
07:15:47.270 --> 07:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
account contracts for family planning so
 
07:15:49.310 --> 07:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
as I said my previous testimony the
 
07:15:51.170 --> 07:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
answer to that question would be no
 
07:15:53.330 --> 07:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
right but that hasn't got anything to do
 
07:15:55.548 --> 07:15:55.558 align:start position:0%
with this bill because this bill doesn't
 
07:15:56.690 --> 07:15:56.700 align:start position:0%
do that
 
07:15:59.270 --> 07:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
right what it does do is it establishes
 
07:16:02.930 --> 07:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
an accountability sequence
 
07:16:05.270 --> 07:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
that we think is far better than the one
 
07:16:08.690 --> 07:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
we have and I will just say to you that
 
07:16:12.890 --> 07:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:14.750 --> 07:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
we have seen in the past where
 
07:16:17.448 --> 07:16:17.458 align:start position:0%
requirements for inspections of clinics
 
07:16:18.770 --> 07:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
and things like that that were supposed
 
07:16:19.850 --> 07:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
07:16:22.548 --> 07:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
we're not done we're not done year after
 
07:16:25.070 --> 07:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
year after year
 
07:16:27.708 --> 07:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
they may be being being done down but a
 
07:16:29.810 --> 07:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
lot of that has to do with our efforts
 
07:16:33.048 --> 07:16:33.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:35.270 --> 07:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
07:16:37.430 --> 07:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm curious why you would support this
 
07:16:40.250 --> 07:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
bill if even if there was a clean bill
 
07:16:42.708 --> 07:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
of health given about co-mingling funds
 
07:16:44.510 --> 07:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't support these
 
07:16:49.610 --> 07:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:52.070 --> 07:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of it what is the
 
07:16:54.110 --> 07:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill it's to increase
 
07:16:54.120 --> 07:16:54.948 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill it's to increase
the

07:16:54.948 --> 07:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:16:57.590 --> 07:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
or establish I think because it is a
 
07:16:59.110 --> 07:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
better word
 
07:17:01.730 --> 07:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
a level of accountability that I don't
 
07:17:04.548 --> 07:17:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:08.510 --> 07:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative King so in
 
07:17:10.670 --> 07:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
your opening testimony you basically
 
07:17:12.708 --> 07:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
make the case which is what I said
 
07:17:15.170 --> 07:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
earlier that all funds are fungible at
 
07:17:16.490 --> 07:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
the end of the day
 
07:17:19.910 --> 07:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and um sure the the money might not
 
07:17:21.468 --> 07:17:21.478 align:start position:0%
go directly towards abortion but if it
 
07:17:23.270 --> 07:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
helps pay for you know the electricity
 
07:17:25.128 --> 07:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
in the building and the Staffing and all
 
07:17:26.750 --> 07:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
these other things then
 
07:17:28.128 --> 07:17:28.138 align:start position:0%
that's money they don't have to spend
 
07:17:29.390 --> 07:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
towards those things now they can spend
 
07:17:31.310 --> 07:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
it towards abortions so
 
07:17:35.150 --> 07:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
to me it does seem like uh to Riff on
 
07:17:37.070 --> 07:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
what the other representative asks why
 
07:17:39.230 --> 07:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
would you support this bill if you know
 
07:17:41.330 --> 07:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day even if this bill
 
07:17:43.850 --> 07:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
passes all funds are fungible and matter
 
07:17:45.410 --> 07:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
of fact this almost seems like it would
 
07:17:48.288 --> 07:17:48.298 align:start position:0%
hurt your argument because if this bill
 
07:17:50.930 --> 07:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
is Law and all of the abortion providers
 
07:17:52.368 --> 07:17:52.378 align:start position:0%
say hey look we're following the law
 
07:17:54.890 --> 07:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
here and it shows you know by the book
 
07:17:57.708 --> 07:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
we're not committling funds it really
 
07:17:59.510 --> 07:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
kind of weakens your argument in the
 
07:18:02.510 --> 07:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
future if you say hey uh let's just end
 
07:18:04.548 --> 07:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
it all together so it seems like I just
 
07:18:05.628 --> 07:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
don't understand why you would support
 
07:18:07.310 --> 07:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
this bill why not just go right for the
 
07:18:10.128 --> 07:18:10.138 align:start position:0%
right for the throat which is just
 
07:18:12.230 --> 07:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
completely end all money for abortion
 
07:18:14.990 --> 07:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
providers period what was the said the
 
07:18:16.968 --> 07:18:16.978 align:start position:0%
phrase that representative Edwards used
 
07:18:18.770 --> 07:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
in his testimony this amount of
 
07:18:21.410 --> 07:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
political calculation involved in all of
 
07:18:21.420 --> 07:18:22.190 align:start position:0%
political calculation involved in all of
this

07:18:22.190 --> 07:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:18:25.250 --> 07:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
so I see this as an incremental way
 
07:18:27.770 --> 07:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
of reducing
 
07:18:29.570 --> 07:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
State involvement
 
07:18:32.448 --> 07:18:32.458 align:start position:0%
in the in abortions
 
07:18:34.430 --> 07:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
if we could do better
 
07:18:35.750 --> 07:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
I would
 
07:18:37.128 --> 07:18:37.138 align:start position:0%
but we can't
 
07:18:40.368 --> 07:18:40.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:43.968 --> 07:18:43.978 align:start position:0%
hey I see none thank you very much
 
07:18:46.310 --> 07:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
next signed up to testify is Kayla
 
07:18:48.110 --> 07:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
Montgomery from Planned Parenthood of
 
07:19:07.190 --> 07:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:09.530 --> 07:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone
 
07:19:09.540 --> 07:19:10.430 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone
um

07:19:10.430 --> 07:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:12.230 --> 07:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
my name is Kayla Montgomery I am the
 
07:19:13.610 --> 07:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
vice president of public affairs for
 
07:19:14.810 --> 07:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood Northern New England
 
07:19:17.330 --> 07:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire we posed this bill I
 
07:19:18.890 --> 07:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
will try and be quick
 
07:19:21.048 --> 07:19:21.058 align:start position:0%
um I recognize how late it's getting and
 
07:19:23.150 --> 07:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
I have to go pick up my kids in 10
 
07:19:23.160 --> 07:19:24.530 align:start position:0%
I have to go pick up my kids in 10
minutes

07:19:24.530 --> 07:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
07:19:26.570 --> 07:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
um can't be late for that definitely you
 
07:19:29.628 --> 07:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
only have three so it works out well
 
07:19:31.548 --> 07:19:31.558 align:start position:0%
um so we are a three-state organization
 
07:19:33.048 --> 07:19:33.058 align:start position:0%
main Vermont New Hampshire we have 15
 
07:19:35.170 --> 07:19:35.180 align:start position:0%
Health Centers across our three states
 
07:19:37.310 --> 07:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh four of them are here in New
 
07:19:39.230 --> 07:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire two of the house hunters in
 
07:19:41.510 --> 07:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire provide abortion care two
 
07:19:44.090 --> 07:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
of them do not but all of them provide
 
07:19:45.708 --> 07:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
essential reproductive health care so
 
07:19:48.048 --> 07:19:48.058 align:start position:0%
we're talking about birth control cancer
 
07:19:50.270 --> 07:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
screenings SDI testing and treatment
 
07:19:52.610 --> 07:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
particularly important now as STI rates
 
07:19:54.468 --> 07:19:54.478 align:start position:0%
are really on the rise in this region
 
07:19:56.868 --> 07:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
and we do it all on a sliding scale fee
 
07:19:58.128 --> 07:19:58.138 align:start position:0%
if you come in and you can't afford
 
07:20:00.468 --> 07:20:00.478 align:start position:0%
Services we give them to you for free
 
07:20:02.270 --> 07:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background about Planned
 
07:20:04.430 --> 07:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and our involvement in the
 
07:20:06.948 --> 07:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we have been in
 
07:20:08.090 --> 07:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Family Planning
 
07:20:10.810 --> 07:20:10.820 align:start position:0%
program since its Inception in 1972.
 
07:20:14.030 --> 07:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
with the exception briefly in 2011 and
 
07:20:17.570 --> 07:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
2015 we were out of the program for a
 
07:20:19.310 --> 07:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
couple of years and then of course now
 
07:20:21.170 --> 07:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
as we are not in the program
 
07:20:24.250 --> 07:20:24.260 align:start position:0%
so as it was mentioned House Bill 2
 
07:20:27.770 --> 07:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
required Financial reviews and Planned
 
07:20:28.868 --> 07:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
Parenthood in Northern New England
 
07:20:32.510 --> 07:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
complied DHS made that clear that we
 
07:20:34.490 --> 07:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
were forthcoming with all requests and
 
07:20:37.030 --> 07:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
we heard from a representative
 
07:20:39.410 --> 07:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
after the reviews were completed in the
 
07:20:41.510 --> 07:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
summer of 21 that quote there is no way
 
07:20:43.190 --> 07:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
our contract dollars could be
 
07:20:45.288 --> 07:20:45.298 align:start position:0%
subsidizing any other programs at those
 
07:20:47.810 --> 07:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
facilities we heard that after the
 
07:20:49.548 --> 07:20:49.558 align:start position:0%
audits were complete we heard that just
 
07:20:51.350 --> 07:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
now today
 
07:20:52.788 --> 07:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
um and of course regardless of these
 
07:20:54.830 --> 07:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
legal assurances that were provided the
 
07:20:57.230 --> 07:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
council rejected these contracts four
 
07:20:59.930 --> 07:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
different times and that was 80 percent
 
07:21:01.548 --> 07:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
07:21:03.410 --> 07:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
so we have not been in the New Hampshire
 
07:21:05.690 --> 07:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
Family Planning program since June 30th
 
07:21:09.530 --> 07:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
of 2021 but we are still in the federal
 
07:21:12.530 --> 07:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
title 10 program we are select Medicaid
 
07:21:14.690 --> 07:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
and we hope to of course one day get
 
07:21:16.010 --> 07:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
back in the New Hampshire title 10
 
07:21:16.020 --> 07:21:17.030 align:start position:0%
back in the New Hampshire title 10
program

07:21:17.030 --> 07:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
07:21:20.090 --> 07:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
so of course we are still Bound by these
 
07:21:22.430 --> 07:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws uh the Hyde
 
07:21:24.770 --> 07:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
Amendment and other regulations
 
07:21:27.468 --> 07:21:27.478 align:start position:0%
regarding funding so we have long
 
07:21:29.270 --> 07:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
established by long establishment in 50
 
07:21:31.330 --> 07:21:31.340 align:start position:0%
years long established guidelines
 
07:21:33.968 --> 07:21:33.978 align:start position:0%
policies trainings
 
07:21:37.850 --> 07:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
requirements in place that we do now
 
07:21:39.410 --> 07:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
even though we're not in the program
 
07:21:41.810 --> 07:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
because we have other reasons to
 
07:21:44.930 --> 07:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
maintain these guidelines So for 50
 
07:21:46.490 --> 07:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
years these systems have been in place
 
07:21:48.948 --> 07:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
no state or federal funds are ever used
 
07:21:52.670 --> 07:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
for abortion Services as we heard
 
07:21:54.830 --> 07:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
so a couple of questions that this leads
 
07:21:56.090 --> 07:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
us to
 
07:21:58.690 --> 07:21:58.700 align:start position:0%
um in we've heard a lot around Financial
 
07:22:01.250 --> 07:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
Audits and we too at Planned Parenthood
 
07:22:02.930 --> 07:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
of Northern New England do a yearly
 
07:22:06.708 --> 07:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
Financial audit PPN e is bound by the
 
07:22:09.490 --> 07:22:09.500 align:start position:0%
exact same Federal IRS laws that all
 
07:22:12.410 --> 07:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
501c3s are any organization that
 
07:22:14.628 --> 07:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
receives over 750
 
07:22:17.270 --> 07:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
000 in federal grants must conduct an
 
07:22:19.850 --> 07:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
external independent audit every year to
 
07:22:21.770 --> 07:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance with our federal
 
07:22:21.780 --> 07:22:22.968 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance with our federal
grants

07:22:22.968 --> 07:22:22.978 align:start position:0%
grants
 
07:22:25.610 --> 07:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
you can find these right on our website
 
07:22:27.468 --> 07:22:27.478 align:start position:0%
you can pick up your phone right now and
 
07:22:30.650 --> 07:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
look at it ppnme.org about us you will
 
07:22:32.990 --> 07:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
see the last few years of audits I
 
07:22:34.490 --> 07:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
didn't bring them with me I didn't print
 
07:22:35.990 --> 07:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
them out but you can find them online
 
07:22:38.990 --> 07:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
right now and that brings up some
 
07:22:40.788 --> 07:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
questions and representative Weber also
 
07:22:42.230 --> 07:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
asks these questions are these reviews
 
07:22:44.628 --> 07:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
in addition to what we already do
 
07:22:46.788 --> 07:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
um do we have to do these audits even
 
07:22:48.170 --> 07:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
though we're not in the program so those
 
07:22:49.730 --> 07:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
are your wrap up in the next minute or
 
07:22:51.708 --> 07:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
so sure um just a couple of other
 
07:22:53.810 --> 07:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
questions uh I had a lot of questions
 
07:22:55.368 --> 07:22:55.378 align:start position:0%
around the geographic requirements but
 
07:22:57.170 --> 07:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor said
 
07:22:59.030 --> 07:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I I'll save my comments on that until
 
07:23:01.368 --> 07:23:01.378 align:start position:0%
we see an amendment on that
 
07:23:03.288 --> 07:23:03.298 align:start position:0%
um the question that was already brought
 
07:23:05.690 --> 07:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
up around contracts better qualified
 
07:23:07.190 --> 07:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
Health Center this they contract with
 
07:23:09.048 --> 07:23:09.058 align:start position:0%
PPN e
 
07:23:11.510 --> 07:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
um for instance a federally qualified
 
07:23:13.430 --> 07:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
Health Center does wonderful care but
 
07:23:15.048 --> 07:23:15.058 align:start position:0%
they don't do specialized reproductive
 
07:23:17.510 --> 07:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
care something like um which this was
 
07:23:20.150 --> 07:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier a lark a long-acting
 
07:23:21.830 --> 07:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
reversible contraception from the IUD
 
07:23:23.868 --> 07:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
it's a very popular form of birth
 
07:23:25.430 --> 07:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
control because it's the set it and
 
07:23:27.830 --> 07:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
forget it method you put it in and you
 
07:23:30.170 --> 07:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
can have birth control for six seven
 
07:23:32.750 --> 07:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
years but you can't just go to a CVS and
 
07:23:35.750 --> 07:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
get that it's Specialized Care and so a
 
07:23:37.490 --> 07:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
federal qualified Health Center will
 
07:23:39.288 --> 07:23:39.298 align:start position:0%
contract with Planned Parenthood or
 
07:23:41.030 --> 07:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
another reproductive Health Care
 
07:23:43.548 --> 07:23:43.558 align:start position:0%
Facility because we are we have the
 
07:23:44.930 --> 07:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
inventory we we have the Specialized
 
07:23:47.090 --> 07:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
Care to do this or you know a removal as
 
07:23:49.490 --> 07:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
well this is care that not everyone can
 
07:23:49.500 --> 07:23:50.208 align:start position:0%
well this is care that not everyone can
do

07:23:50.208 --> 07:23:50.218 align:start position:0%
do
 
07:23:52.490 --> 07:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
another question around there's a
 
07:23:54.468 --> 07:23:54.478 align:start position:0%
Medicaid statement in there it appears
 
07:23:56.590 --> 07:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
as Bill Bill might violate the federal
 
07:23:59.208 --> 07:23:59.218 align:start position:0%
free choice of Provider laws that they
 
07:24:01.128 --> 07:24:01.138 align:start position:0%
don't let Medicaid patients come to
 
07:24:03.170 --> 07:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
certain medical providers I think that
 
07:24:05.030 --> 07:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
section needs a little bit of clarity is
 
07:24:07.788 --> 07:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
just not clear also it's unclear to me
 
07:24:11.690 --> 07:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
whether this applies to private OBS that
 
07:24:13.070 --> 07:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
aren't funded by state or federal
 
07:24:14.750 --> 07:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
government that also perform abortion in
 
07:24:16.150 --> 07:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there are a few of those
 
07:24:18.708 --> 07:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
and this also came up but it's unclear
 
07:24:21.590 --> 07:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
who pays for this audit do we have to do
 
07:24:23.090 --> 07:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
this audit even though we're not in the
 
07:24:23.100 --> 07:24:23.830 align:start position:0%
this audit even though we're not in the
program

07:24:23.830 --> 07:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
07:24:26.090 --> 07:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
and what about the sites at Planned
 
07:24:28.070 --> 07:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
Parenthood that don't do abortion so our
 
07:24:29.930 --> 07:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
Exeter and dairy sites do they have to
 
07:24:32.868 --> 07:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
do the audits as well so all in all just
 
07:24:35.510 --> 07:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions here
 
07:24:38.510 --> 07:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I will just say one thing because it
 
07:24:41.570 --> 07:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
came up about lobbying and about money I
 
07:24:43.548 --> 07:24:43.558 align:start position:0%
just want to say that I'm not sure where
 
07:24:46.968 --> 07:24:46.978 align:start position:0%
the information came from the um the
 
07:24:48.468 --> 07:24:48.478 align:start position:0%
person that was
 
07:24:50.750 --> 07:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
brought up by a previous person about
 
07:24:52.968 --> 07:24:52.978 align:start position:0%
their work Planned Parenthood hasn't
 
07:24:54.350 --> 07:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
been here for three years so I'm not
 
07:24:55.610 --> 07:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
sure where that information came from
 
07:24:58.070 --> 07:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
and of course my Lobby reports are
 
07:24:59.810 --> 07:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
always available online if anyone wants
 
07:25:02.628 --> 07:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
to see those lobbying reports and I just
 
07:25:04.310 --> 07:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
dropped mine off actually thank you
 
07:25:05.868 --> 07:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions I'm
 
07:25:07.430 --> 07:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
07:25:10.788 --> 07:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you have you done any side-by-side
 
07:25:13.730 --> 07:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
estimates of how much an additional
 
07:25:17.030 --> 07:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
audit would cost versus how much you
 
07:25:18.890 --> 07:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
might get in state contracts to actually
 
07:25:21.350 --> 07:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
provide services from people I haven't
 
07:25:23.150 --> 07:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
but of course the state contracts are
 
07:25:25.968 --> 07:25:25.978 align:start position:0%
getting the the pot of funds is getting
 
07:25:28.730 --> 07:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
smaller every year or it has been
 
07:25:31.490 --> 07:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
there's been a dramatic reduction I
 
07:25:32.750 --> 07:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
would say
 
07:25:34.850 --> 07:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
um so it's we're not talking a lot of
 
07:25:36.770 --> 07:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
money so you know eight thousand ten
 
07:25:39.230 --> 07:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars on a an audit would
 
07:25:41.570 --> 07:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
certainly impact that we want to be able
 
07:25:44.150 --> 07:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
to provide care for people
 
07:25:45.230 --> 07:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
um you know like I said we give away
 
07:25:47.810 --> 07:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in free health care
 
07:25:49.670 --> 07:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
services to low-income people in New
 
07:25:51.530 --> 07:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to keep the state healthy and
 
07:25:53.208 --> 07:25:53.218 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that the money that
 
07:25:55.368 --> 07:25:55.378 align:start position:0%
we get goes to those Direct Services for
 
07:25:57.830 --> 07:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
helping people and not towards audits
 
07:25:59.270 --> 07:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
that are already redundant
 
07:26:00.530 --> 07:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:26:04.010 --> 07:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:05.570 --> 07:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you very much
 
07:26:07.670 --> 07:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:26:10.128 --> 07:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
next signed up to testify is Roy Dennehy
 
07:26:19.128 --> 07:26:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:21.830 --> 07:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so much chairman and the
 
07:26:24.410 --> 07:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
committee I'll make it very quick very
 
07:26:26.930 --> 07:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
um concise here
 
07:26:29.690 --> 07:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
um this bill continues the policy from
 
07:26:32.090 --> 07:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
the last legislative session
 
07:26:34.430 --> 07:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh when Planned Parenthood was denied
 
07:26:36.350 --> 07:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funding to provide abortion
 
07:26:36.360 --> 07:26:37.670 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funding to provide abortion
services

07:26:37.670 --> 07:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
07:26:40.128 --> 07:26:40.138 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood has consistently made
 
07:26:42.530 --> 07:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
false statements that this lack of
 
07:26:46.070 --> 07:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
funding has hurt a women's health care
 
07:26:49.548 --> 07:26:49.558 align:start position:0%
as a point of fact abortion is is not
 
07:26:51.310 --> 07:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
Women's Health Care
 
07:26:54.288 --> 07:26:54.298 align:start position:0%
it is specifically
 
07:26:54.298 --> 07:26:55.788 align:start position:0%
it is specifically
to

07:26:55.788 --> 07:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:26:58.670 --> 07:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
um to kill a pre-born baby that's what
 
07:27:02.090 --> 07:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
what abortion is as a public service the
 
07:27:03.708 --> 07:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right to life organization
 
07:27:06.590 --> 07:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
has published a directory of dozens of
 
07:27:08.090 --> 07:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
inexpensive and free health care
 
07:27:10.430 --> 07:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
providers in New Hampshire that would
 
07:27:12.890 --> 07:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
not affect that were not affected by the
 
07:27:16.010 --> 07:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
lack of State funding and I just have a
 
07:27:18.708 --> 07:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
one example here of probably a dozen
 
07:27:20.990 --> 07:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
right here in my hand
 
07:27:21.000 --> 07:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
right here in my hand
um

07:27:21.590 --> 07:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:23.390 --> 07:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers of the Granite State
 
07:27:25.190 --> 07:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
should not be funding planned
 
07:27:28.310 --> 07:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
parenthood's abortion services
 
07:27:31.610 --> 07:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
and that's it thank you thank you
 
07:27:35.868 --> 07:27:35.878 align:start position:0%
any questions this gentlemen
 
07:27:39.288 --> 07:27:39.298 align:start position:0%
see you done thank you
 
07:27:41.628 --> 07:27:41.638 align:start position:0%

07:27:44.930 --> 07:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
of someone who signed up to testify is
 
07:27:47.270 --> 07:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
from Jason Hennessey from Amherst New
 
07:27:49.010 --> 07:27:49.020 align:start position:0%

07:27:49.020 --> 07:27:54.468 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with New Hampshire right to
life

07:27:54.468 --> 07:27:54.478 align:start position:0%

to life and I'm here to speak
 
07:28:05.930 --> 07:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically in support of of the
 
07:28:07.968 --> 07:28:07.978 align:start position:0%
bill before you HP 615
 
07:28:10.190 --> 07:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
this is about this is a controversial
 
07:28:12.948 --> 07:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
subject obviously about 70 percent of
 
07:28:14.810 --> 07:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rights agree with some
 
07:28:17.770 --> 07:28:17.780 align:start position:0%
sort of restriction on abortion
 
07:28:20.090 --> 07:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
so the question is then what do we do
 
07:28:22.250 --> 07:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
with our tax dollars
 
07:28:25.128 --> 07:28:25.138 align:start position:0%
so this isn't you know this isn't
 
07:28:26.868 --> 07:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
something like whether we pave a certain
 
07:28:29.750 --> 07:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
Road or something like that this is this
 
07:28:32.690 --> 07:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
is more about uh what some people think
 
07:28:36.048 --> 07:28:36.058 align:start position:0%
is the largest human rights uh violation
 
07:28:38.390 --> 07:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
going on in the state right now which is
 
07:28:38.400 --> 07:28:40.190 align:start position:0%
going on in the state right now which is
abortion

07:28:40.190 --> 07:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
07:28:42.650 --> 07:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
so this this bill codifies the hp2
 
07:28:46.250 --> 07:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
language and I just like to respond to
 
07:28:47.868 --> 07:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
something I heard earlier that there
 
07:28:49.910 --> 07:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
there has been separation you know if
 
07:28:51.590 --> 07:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to pay for my utilities
 
07:28:52.850 --> 07:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
at home
 
07:28:56.570 --> 07:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
um and or per Taps pay for uh my rent or
 
07:28:58.010 --> 07:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
something like that that would be
 
07:28:58.020 --> 07:28:59.208 align:start position:0%
something like that that would be
wonderful

07:28:59.208 --> 07:28:59.218 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
07:29:02.090 --> 07:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
um but that's what co-mingling the funds
 
07:29:04.070 --> 07:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
does it when you have you know if you
 
07:29:05.930 --> 07:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
have facilities and utilities being paid
 
07:29:08.390 --> 07:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
for out of one pocket obviously it's
 
07:29:10.788 --> 07:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting the stuff the
 
07:29:12.410 --> 07:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
abortion stuff that's going on in the
 
07:29:13.670 --> 07:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
other place
 
07:29:15.650 --> 07:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
uh something I'd like to point out is
 
07:29:17.330 --> 07:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
that planned parented over the last year
 
07:29:20.570 --> 07:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
since the uh Family Planning contracts
 
07:29:23.390 --> 07:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
were were denied
 
07:29:25.788 --> 07:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
has closed six facilities
 
07:29:28.490 --> 07:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
presumably as a as a result of the of
 
07:29:31.310 --> 07:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
the denial something interesting is that
 
07:29:32.810 --> 07:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
five of them were in Vermont
 
07:29:35.390 --> 07:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
So based on the evidence there I'd like
 
07:29:37.070 --> 07:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
to ask you know is this money really
 
07:29:39.650 --> 07:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
being spent on New Hampshire purposes or
 
07:29:40.788 --> 07:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
is it being used to subsidize
 
07:29:42.890 --> 07:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
out-of-state things because it's one
 
07:29:46.310 --> 07:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
entity for Vermont made in New Hampshire
 
07:29:48.288 --> 07:29:48.298 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to point out that New
 
07:29:49.788 --> 07:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire denying These funds did not
 
07:29:51.948 --> 07:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
stop the funds from coming so Planned
 
07:29:53.990 --> 07:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
Parenthood received half a million
 
07:29:56.330 --> 07:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
dollars from the federal HHS as part of
 
07:29:58.128 --> 07:29:58.138 align:start position:0%
the title 10 program
 
07:30:00.468 --> 07:30:00.478 align:start position:0%
and in terms of I've heard a lot of
 
07:30:02.930 --> 07:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
questions about the audit and the cost
 
07:30:05.868 --> 07:30:05.878 align:start position:0%
and if you look at their last audited
 
07:30:08.570 --> 07:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
statement the they spent about they had
 
07:30:10.190 --> 07:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
a total budget of about 28 million
 
07:30:10.200 --> 07:30:11.030 align:start position:0%
a total budget of about 28 million
dollars

07:30:11.030 --> 07:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
07:30:12.830 --> 07:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
only 20 million of that was actually
 
07:30:15.048 --> 07:30:15.058 align:start position:0%
spent on Services the rest of the 8
 
07:30:16.368 --> 07:30:16.378 align:start position:0%
million were spent on things like
 
07:30:18.830 --> 07:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
lobbying and administration and
 
07:30:22.010 --> 07:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
fundraising so if you can't find five
 
07:30:24.350 --> 07:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
eight or ten thousand dollars out of you
 
07:30:26.330 --> 07:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
know eight million dollars then
 
07:30:28.250 --> 07:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think that's the state's
 
07:30:28.260 --> 07:30:29.330 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think that's the state's
issue

07:30:29.330 --> 07:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
issue
 
07:30:32.150 --> 07:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
so with that uh
 
07:30:34.968 --> 07:30:34.978 align:start position:0%
I just wanted uh uh let's see
 
07:30:37.190 --> 07:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
yep so with that I would love to take
 
07:30:39.048 --> 07:30:39.058 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
07:30:41.090 --> 07:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
