rules okay thank you in some instances I
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
know they want to do a conditional
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
approval but they got our comments
 
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
fairly late and didn't have enough
 
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.110 align:start position:0%

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
second that was gray and Becky Whitley
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
senat gr say who made the motion tost to
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
postponements seeing none all in favor
 
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
say I I I that would include the waivers
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
necessary okay so I think that leaves us
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
ready to start with uh item 202
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
2467 okay who has that that would be my
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
rule okay um so this is from the
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
Affairs that's on the housing Champion
 
00:09:58.829 --> 00:09:58.839 align:start position:0%
program the department did file an
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval and the
 
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
only remaining comment is on page 35 of
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
the amended conditional approval after
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
the department Awards
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
a um Grant or a loan to a municipality
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
or a private developer and that award is
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
approved by the governor and the
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
executive Council the department will
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
then enter into an agreement with the
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
award e and there is um a
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
potential basis for objection that these
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
agreements were are rules because they
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
are going to be applied to people
 
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
outside of the agency and they may
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
impose requirements on these individuals
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
or these awardees that would apply to
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
other awardees um so under the
 
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
A14 uh it would technically be
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
considered a rule but the committee has
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
taken varied positions on this
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
interpretation um for example last year
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
when the department of administrative
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
Services brought their procurement rules
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
before the committee even though
 
00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:06.470 align:start position:0%
before the committee even though
multiple

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
uh agreements by the department of
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
administrative Services were the same uh
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
the committee did see that there were
 
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
some differences and therefore found
 
00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
them more to be contracts as opposed to
 
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
rules uh so that is the only comment I
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
have on this rule
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
set would you like to tell us who you
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
are this morning and uh probably the
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
same person's regularly as well
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh so uh and then tell us what you think
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
about the contract rule aspect uh thank
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
you very much uh committee members my
 
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
name is Chase Hegman I'm the director of
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
economic development at Bea introduce
 
00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
yourself Andrew my name is Andrew Dorset
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
I'm the Housing Finance director at Bea
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
for the invest New Hampshire
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
program and just to follow up on the um
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
attorney ricard's comments um the
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
purpose of this Clause is simply to
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
identify that Awards or agreements with
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
would be entered into with the with the
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
um uh recipients of funding that would
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
then go to governor and Council for
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
authorization uh the agreements
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
themselves would effectively be
 
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
contracts um uh subject to terms within
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
uh the state standard p37 or G1 plus uh
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
any terms relevant to their specific
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
application within the program so the
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
scope of the project um would be the
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
more customized terms within each
 
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.470 align:start position:0%
more customized terms within each
contract

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay well the the jel car has
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
approved similar things in the past on
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
the basis of being contracts uh but it's
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
