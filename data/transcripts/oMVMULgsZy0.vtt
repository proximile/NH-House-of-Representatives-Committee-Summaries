00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
we would take it under consideration
 

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.750 align:start position:0%
we would take it under consideration

we identified um the sort of segments of

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
organize in that

the best way forward would be to
 

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.630 align:start position:0%
the best way forward would be to
um<00:22:07.440><c> I</c><00:22:07.600><c> guess</c><00:22:07.960><c> start</c><00:22:08.279><c> at</c><00:22:08.400><c> the</c><00:22:08.559><c> beginning</c><00:22:09.240><c> but</c>

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess start at the beginning but
 

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.630 align:start position:0%
um I guess start at the beginning but
like<00:22:09.760><c> we're</c><00:22:09.880><c> going</c><00:22:10.000><c> to</c><00:22:10.120><c> find</c><00:22:10.360><c> out</c><00:22:10.640><c> immediately</c>

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
like we're going to find out immediately
 

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.470 align:start position:0%
like we're going to find out immediately
that<00:22:11.880><c> one</c><00:22:12.000><c> of</c><00:22:12.120><c> the</c><00:22:12.320><c> first</c><00:22:12.840><c> one</c><00:22:12.960><c> of</c><00:22:13.080><c> the</c>

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
that one of the first one of the
 

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.350 align:start position:0%
that one of the first one of the
protocols<00:22:14.159><c> was</c><00:22:14.440><c> is</c><00:22:14.679><c> we</c><00:22:14.799><c> shut</c>

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
protocols was is we shut
 

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.470 align:start position:0%
protocols was is we shut
down<00:22:17.360><c> and</c><00:22:18.000><c> that</c><00:22:18.320><c> the</c><00:22:18.480><c> next</c><00:22:18.720><c> thing</c><00:22:18.919><c> was</c><00:22:19.480><c> masking</c>

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
down and that the next thing was masking
 

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.990 align:start position:0%
down and that the next thing was masking
uh<00:22:20.640><c> those</c><00:22:20.799><c> were</c><00:22:21.080><c> two</c><00:22:21.440><c> early</c><00:22:21.799><c> on</c><00:22:22.279><c> protocols</c>

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh those were two early on protocols
 

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.549 align:start position:0%
uh those were two early on protocols
that<00:22:23.200><c> happen</c><00:22:23.520><c> chronologic</c><00:22:24.279><c> in</c><00:22:24.400><c> a</c>

00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
that happen chronologic in a
 

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:27.190 align:start position:0%
that happen chronologic in a
chronological<00:22:25.200><c> order</c><00:22:25.960><c> and</c><00:22:26.159><c> I</c><00:22:26.320><c> think</c><00:22:26.559><c> if</c><00:22:26.760><c> we</c>

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
chronological order and I think if we
 

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.510 align:start position:0%
chronological order and I think if we
look<00:22:27.400><c> at</c><00:22:27.640><c> that</c>

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
look at that
 

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.350 align:start position:0%
look at that
you'll<00:22:28.880><c> find</c><00:22:29.320><c> that</c><00:22:29.720><c> when</c><00:22:29.919><c> we</c><00:22:30.080><c> did</c><00:22:30.279><c> shut</c><00:22:30.600><c> down</c>

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
you'll find that when we did shut down
 

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.950 align:start position:0%
you'll find that when we did shut down
then<00:22:31.520><c> we</c><00:22:31.640><c> were</c><00:22:31.919><c> encouraging</c><00:22:32.480><c> the</c><00:22:32.640><c> Open</c><00:22:33.000><c> Spaces</c>

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
then we were encouraging the Open Spaces
 

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.510 align:start position:0%
then we were encouraging the Open Spaces
uh<00:22:34.080><c> which</c><00:22:34.240><c> brings</c><00:22:34.520><c> in</c><00:22:35.480><c> uh</c><00:22:35.720><c> the</c><00:22:36.039><c> commissioner</c>

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh which brings in uh the commissioner
 

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.110 align:start position:0%
uh which brings in uh the commissioner
with<00:22:36.640><c> the</c><00:22:36.760><c> state</c><00:22:37.200><c> parks</c><00:22:38.200><c> uh</c><00:22:38.440><c> then</c><00:22:38.799><c> then</c><00:22:38.919><c> we'll</c>

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the state parks uh then then we'll
 

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.110 align:start position:0%
with the state parks uh then then we'll
get<00:22:39.279><c> into</c><00:22:40.039><c> as</c><00:22:40.159><c> we</c><00:22:40.320><c> go</c><00:22:40.440><c> on</c><00:22:40.840><c> further</c><00:22:41.840><c> a</c><00:22:41.960><c> little</c>

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
get into as we go on further a little
 

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.669 align:start position:0%
get into as we go on further a little
bit<00:22:42.320><c> further</c><00:22:42.720><c> down</c><00:22:43.000><c> we'll</c><00:22:43.159><c> see</c><00:22:43.400><c> that</c><00:22:43.559><c> where</c>

00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
bit further down we'll see that where
 

00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:46.590 align:start position:0%

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
going to have to produce a timeline and
 

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
going to have to produce a timeline and

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
by you know that showed up do the same
 

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.349 align:start position:0%
by you know that showed up do the same
thing<00:36:01.520><c> and</c><00:36:01.680><c> that</c><00:36:01.960><c> gives</c><00:36:02.160><c> us</c><00:36:02.359><c> a</c><00:36:02.560><c> sort</c><00:36:02.760><c> of</c>

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
thing and that gives us a sort of
 

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:07.069 align:start position:0%
thing and that gives us a sort of
logical<00:36:04.359><c> procedure</c><00:36:05.079><c> but</c><00:36:05.240><c> at</c><00:36:05.400><c> the</c><00:36:05.599><c> same</c><00:36:06.079><c> time</c>

00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
logical procedure but at the same time
 

00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:09.030 align:start position:0%
logical procedure but at the same time
well<00:36:07.240><c> it</c><00:36:07.359><c> makes</c><00:36:07.560><c> it</c><00:36:07.760><c> logical</c><00:36:08.200><c> in</c><00:36:08.400><c> multiple</c>

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
well it makes it logical in multiple
 

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.630 align:start position:0%
well it makes it logical in multiple
ways<00:36:09.400><c> so</c><00:36:09.599><c> it</c><00:36:09.839><c> makes</c><00:36:10.040><c> it</c><00:36:10.200><c> easier</c><00:36:10.560><c> to</c>

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
ways so it makes it easier to
 

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:16.349 align:start position:0%
ways so it makes it easier to
