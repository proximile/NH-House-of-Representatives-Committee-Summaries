00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
about the the meeting time and the
 
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
dates um to see uh everyone's
 
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
availability and my thought is that we
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
would do this in chronological order but
 
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
I am open to suggestions on how the
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee would like to proceed so if
 
00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
anyone has any thoughts um and uh the
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
normal date would be Fridays at the same
 
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
ahead

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.870 align:start position:0%
ahead
representative

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
gr thank you um I spoke with the other
 
00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
Representatives who could not be here
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
and Friday is a good day for us we would
 
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
prefer the morning because some of us
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
have committee meetings in the afternoon
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
so if we could meet in the morning that
 
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
would be best for us if that would work
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
for for at least five of
 
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
us uh how does the rest does that work
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the committee Yuri
 
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
represent of uh beler pitz and could you
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
let me
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
know I I think that would be okay we're
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
on education together so typically we
 
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
ask uh uh for me afternoon sa better but
 
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
I can be flexible if the rest of
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
committee needs money I can be amendable
 
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 align:start position:0%
to meet on Friday
 
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.230 align:start position:0%
to meet on Friday
[Music]

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
mornings yeah I'm I'm actually I would
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
love Friday mornings uh the earlier the
 
00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
better um for me and I just wanted to
 
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that if there's any like today
 
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
I had to testify um on a bill so that if
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
any of us have you know if there is
 
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
something with a another Comm that we
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
run out and can come back but I would I
 
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
would love to do mornings as well
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay so hearing that Friday mornings
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
would work best uh would uh 9:00 a.m.
 
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
start time be amendable to folks that
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.189 align:start position:0%
 
noon

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
noon
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
okay um so uh for the future we'll plan
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
on Friday meet morning meetings starting
 
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
at 9:00
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
a.m. I know that we are coming up
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
against a session break however um
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
with the amount of
 
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
information that this committee needs to
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
get through I'm wondering if everyone is
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
available on February
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
1st well I think March 1 is the end of
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
the break right it is yes so I don't
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
think any um I know that the five people
 
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
that I representing right now are not
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
available because they're all some of
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
them are going
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.469 align:start position:0%
them are going
away

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 align:start position:0%
my kids want me to go away I don't know
 
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go away or not but if
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
we're here I'll come
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
so uh February 22nd would be the start
 
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
everyone I was hoping to sneak away but
 
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
um I will this takes priority so I will
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
not sneak away if we're going to meet if
 
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
we aren't going to meet I'm going to
 
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.629 align:start position:0%
we aren't going to meet I'm going to
sneak

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
sneak
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
away yeah F Friday February
 
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.670 align:start position:0%
away yeah F Friday February
23rd

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
23rd
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
me represent gr did you yes I are we
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
meeting once a month every other like
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
are we going to meet twice a month
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
because if we do that maybe we say that
 
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
we're no we're going to be meeting every
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
Friday oh well okay that's not going to
 
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
be um that that was the car on other on
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
Fridays and so and Karen eel has other
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay and and that's why I was thinking
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
some afternoons because I know some
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
people have meetings in the
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
mornings um so I wasn't sure but we can
 
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
uh I will reach out with um the rest of
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
the committee and find out and let
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
everyone know what everyone where
 
00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.550 align:start position:0%
everyone know what everyone where
everyone

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
stands can we be flexible on our Fridays
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
as far as mornings or afternoons based
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
on the committee schedule I think that
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
prudent yeah I agree the flexibility of
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
it I'd be happy to try to um put
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
everybody all the representatives in
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
kind of like one column and then you
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
know especially with commitments and
 
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
Friday and just to do a tally I can do
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
that to see where things come and then
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
when we're placing dates so you know um
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'll do
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.790 align:start position:0%
I'll do
that

00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
um earlier today we received a email
 
00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:06.389 align:start position:0%

from

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
report a pretty comprehensive report um
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if everyone had a chance to
 
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
look at that um and I was just wondering
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
if uh anyone would mind if I had her
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
report would entail and tell us a little
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
bit about it does anyone
 
00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:38.870 align:start position:0%

00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
health is still within my book of
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
business though so um I have some
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
experience we were just talking about uh
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
March 2020 uh so I have been there
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire time I have an
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
incredible team as you as many of you
 
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
know um as you go further into your
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
committee I'm I hope that you'll take
 
00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to hear from them the
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
folks that are absolutely experts in
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
those fields I was saying you don't want
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
me to get here and talk about the
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
laboratory and the panther machines and
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
all of that like we've got great people
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
who can do that so speaking towards this
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
after Action Report called an
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
a um the governor was very interested in
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we had a complete record
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
of what the response was what the
 
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
challenges were what the strengths were
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
and how the state came together and so
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
he charged Homeland Security and
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management HSM to work with a
 
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
vendor with a contractor to develop that
 
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
after action report it is well underway
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
um it it will be completed in June of
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
this year we have there is a draft right
 
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
now that isn't ready for public vetting
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
quite yet they're just getting in the
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
informations there was a series of um uh
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
interviews and surveys that were
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
crosscutting across many many different
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups um as I noted in the
 
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
email this morning it is far beyond just
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
the health and medical components of the
 
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
um of the response and really takes a
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
look at um our overall level of
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
preparedness to be begin with the
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
command structure the unified command
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
structure that was based out of the
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
state emergency Operation Center our
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
Communications our how we made decisions
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
and what kind of compliance we had which
 
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
I know is something of interest to this
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee the financial management not
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
only of specific I know you there is
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
some um interest around vaccine but
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
overall around the financial management
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
of all of the covid funds that came into
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
the state of course the health and
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
medical components which would include
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
both the testing um the policies vaccine
 
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
eventually Therapeutics all of those
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
components come together and so it's
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
taking a look at that um looking at how
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
we manage the logistics our public
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
private Partnerships and public
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
information in that public private
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
Partnerships one of the things that I'm
 
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
very proud of was the governor had stood
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
up something called the governor's
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
reopening task force that really worked
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
in those early days to hear from
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
Community from industry to understand
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
what it would take to reopen and reopen
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
in a way that was safe for their staff
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
and their customers so that's the high
 
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
Lev overview of what that after action
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
report is um it's underway it won't be
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
done until the beginning till June um
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure that there are pieces of it
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
that we can certainly start exploring
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
within this committee as well so as not
 
00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions please thank you um Miss
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
Tilly what how was I'm I'm trying to I
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
spoke with members of my community
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
before today and some of them had wanted
 
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
to come and testify before the committee
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be important to
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
have people from New Hampshire who were
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
involved with municipalities or U Public
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
Utilities such or Public Safety um
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
organizations come and speak with us and
 
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
my well was the link between your
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
activity and what municipalities were
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
doing oh that's an excellent question
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative groda so um we
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
worked closely um we being the
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
worked very closely under this what was
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
called the unified command structure
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
that was based at the state emergency
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
Operation Center and within that entity
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
that was the emergency group that was
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
pulled together and so it had
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
representatives from all of the most
 
00:13:58.829 --> 00:13:58.839 align:start position:0%
Major Impact um state agencies so
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
everything from Health and Human
 
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
Services to economic supports to uh
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
transportation and hsem homeland
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
security has a special relationship with
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
the municipalities and so there was a
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
direct messaging to the municipalities
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
through that unified command structure
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know for example they had early it
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
was more than this but sort of at once
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
we got into a steady Cadence there were
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
once a week calls with the
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities from Homeland Security to
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
talk about what the changing guidelines
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
were again you know all of us may have
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
memories of that time when everything
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
shut down how do we reopen restaurants
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
shut down how do you reopen that what
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
was the role of a a health officer in a
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
community um even down to how do you
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
safely plow the roads when um you need
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
to might have like two guys in a truck
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
so like those were the breath of um
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
things that were discussed but typically
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
most of the um messaging came from
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security through those channels
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
um out to the
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities thank you so M mam chair
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
I would imagine that we'd want to hear
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
about that because I know for our own
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
town um we are part of the SE Coast
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
Community and we have a lot of state
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
parks and so the commissioner of state
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
parks was in contact with us I think it
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
was every week on Friday mornings
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
actually to talk about what was going on
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
and what the protocols were going to be
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
for people to park because it was
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
outside right it was available to the
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
public yes I I mean my recollection of
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
that time as well especially early in
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
2020 was um the the state parks
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the time was actually on
 
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
that reopening task force and so he was
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
engaged right away going how do we
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
reopen safely again you know especially
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
that first summer everybody Public
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
Health included wanted people to get
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
outside um I think we can all remember
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
the cars parked up on 93 outside of
 
00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
Franconia Notch which was a safety
 
00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
hazard but but it was a reflection of
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that we all everyone was
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
encouraging everyone to get outside for
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
your physical health for your mental
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
health for every reason um and so there
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
was communication that way I'll also
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
note that as part of that unified
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
command there was a leadership call
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
every morning at 8:15 in the morning
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
with um from the governor's office down
 
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
to the highest levels of of state
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
agencies so the central um
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
Communications well never perfect no one
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
can ever look back in an emergency and
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
say the communications were great all
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
the time time um there was a concerted
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
effort to make sure left hand knew what
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
right hand was doing throughout lots of
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
things we learned through that process
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
but that certainly was the um plan going
 
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
on represent
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
Pa thank you Madame chair and thank you
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I wonder day
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
about uh after Action Report uh thank
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
you for working on it and I understand
 
00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.189 align:start position:0%
you for working on it and I understand
that

00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's about to be ready in June uh but
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
as our committee is
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
trying um to get some uh wisdom from it
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully earlier is there any chance
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
like you can provide the committee with
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
some early findings from that report or
 
00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.079 align:start position:0%
something sure so thank you very much
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
for that question so as I said Homeland
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
Security are the the the folks managing
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
it right now so we'll work closely with
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
director buckton understand what we can
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
share what we can't share certainly sort
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
of probably you know I will go out on a
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
a limb and say there's probably some
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
broad Strokes that can be shared right
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
now I don't know that they're ready to
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
share a draft at this moment um because
 
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
it's still actively being written but I
 
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
think there are some broad Strokes
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
learnings that are certainly um
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate as your committee goes on
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
and meets but again the final document
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
June and if you indulge me for another
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
question it's not something we were
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
planning to go deep into today but since
 
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.029 align:start position:0%
planning to go deep into today but since
you

00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
mention uh as far as I understood your
 
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
words you were talking about people who
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
were going hiking and that uh everyone
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
was encouraging people to go outside can
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
you a little bit expand on it
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
because uh the reason I'm asking it's
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
not something that I remember so is it
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
your recollection that it was a public
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
policy advice for people to go outside
 
00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
sure so thank you um you know I know
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
that the governor was very encouraging
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
of people to use outdoor spaces at that
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
time we wanted to make sure that
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
everybody could get out and about um you
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
know I I I don't know that it was a
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
written policy anywhere but it certainly
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
was encouraged for people to get outside
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
um during those especially summer 2020
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
and of course from then I would not have
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
I've been a I'm not a former uh director
 
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
of Public Health without saying that
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
getting outside is always healthy for
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
you you should everyone should get
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
outside and get their exercise every day
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
that's my public health message of the
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
day um but even especially then when um
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
there were so many unknowns about indoor
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
spaces we knew that outdoor spaces were
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
certainly better for um folks to be able
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
to be out and about um you know there
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
were always questions about you know
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
masking and I know that this committee
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
will probably take on some of those
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
masking questions early on about the
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of that and where that
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
was appropriate and the evolution of our
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
understanding of Max masking and um even
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
again thinking about it in a
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
chronological way when we simply did not
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
have supply chain in you know March or
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
time so Madam chair as I'm thinking
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
about this and listening to director
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
Tilly and listening to um representative
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
Poff I'm wondering if I I if we I
 
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
wondering if we put together
 
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
a list of of items that we want to talk
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
about because unless we can communicate
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
that to the public no one's going to
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
know what we're talking about at our
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
particular meetings and so to encourage
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
public input what are your plans on
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
doing that um well uh representative
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
Bel I was going to wait but this is
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
actually a perfect time to interject
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
with a a comment I was going to make on
 
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
with a a comment I was going to make on
the

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
proposed path forward um I I I like
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
certain ideas about the chronological
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
approach but there's a certain amount of
 
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
concern that I have if we work
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
chronologically one of those big
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
concerns is that because we have limited
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
space to get everything done we may
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
either get bogged down in any particular
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
area for too long or the alternative
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
because we're so trying to re you know
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
recognize and we have limited time we
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
might move too fast over certain periods
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
of time so I was going to recommend if
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
we would take it under consideration
 
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
more of a topical based approach where
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
we identified um the sort of segments of
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at and attacked it
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
from that angle so for instance we could
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
have a big topic such as
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
um the um treatment protocols that were
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
prolongated and then underneath that
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
there could be subcategories of okay we
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
could look at early treatment protocols
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
late treatment
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
protocols ventilators vaccines and sort
 
00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
of instead of going from the beginning
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
forward uh it's just my my my belief
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
that it would be a little bit easier to
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
organize in that
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
manner uh thank you for that I I
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
agree and so my thought and that's why
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
we're having this meeting today is so
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
that we can all discuss the best Best
 
00:21:58.279 --> 00:21:59.230 align:start position:0%
that we can all discuss the best Best
Way

00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
Way
 
00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:03.799 align:start position:0%
Forward oh thank you I'm sorry um the
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
the best way forward would be to
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess start at the beginning but
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
like we're going to find out immediately
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
that one of the first one of the
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
protocols was is we shut
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
down and that the next thing was masking
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh those were two early on protocols
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
that happen chronologic in a
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
chronological order and I think if we
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
you'll find that when we did shut down
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
then we were encouraging the Open Spaces
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh which brings in uh the commissioner
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the state parks uh then then we'll
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
get into as we go on further a little
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
bit further down we'll see that where
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
the protocol started coming in uh with
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
the hospitals and the nursing homes and
 
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919 align:start position:0%
things like that but like I said the
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
reason for today's meeting is to
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
discuss the path forward um and how we
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
where where do we want to start first
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
and I am
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
open so I'm wondering whether or not I'm
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
so sorry I'm wondering whether or not we
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
might have start might want to start
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
with the small picture because the small
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
picture is where like for example I'm
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
thinking of municipalities
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities took their direction from
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security so as a result of
 
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
their direction from Homeland Securities
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
what are the things that they did What
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
Would recommend be done again and what
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
didn't work so we have some um what's
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
the word I'm looking for we have some um
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
experience on exactly what happened to
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
the to on on our constituent level
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
because that is who we represent right
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
so and then including that um for
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
example this morning I I was I was I
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
attended a um a school event and I spoke
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
with the school psychologist and I said
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
to her what are what are the things that
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
are now that you um are experiencing as
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
a school psychologist so you know um
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
there are things that we can learn from
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
what what our constituents experienced
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
so that we know what God forbid this
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
ever happens again how we what are the
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
things that we're useful and what are
 
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
the things that we're not useful does
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
that make sense I mean I'm just trying
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
to think I I know that my database are
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
my constituents right that's where I'm
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
go AB absolutely um I do think that it
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
may be useful and I'll to have uh
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
director buckon in here to talk about
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
how he uh communicated with because
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
obviously he was at the top and
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
everything was trickling down and it
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
would be interesting to see where he was
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
taking his direction from and how
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
everything was filtering down
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
um and then from that we can get into
 
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.470 align:start position:0%
um and then from that we can get into
the

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh the schools and how it
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
affects um the our citizenry our
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
constituents um any thoughts on
 
00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:16.070 align:start position:0%
constituents um any thoughts on
that

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
represent yeah I was I was thinking if
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
we were kind of topical but one of the
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
aspects of each topic would be the
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
municip ality for instance education
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
might be a topic but we would have how
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
it affected the schools how it affected
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
the parents how you know all of those
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
people so that would be a topic but it
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
would include and when we do a topic we
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
could ask residents of the state to come
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
in and speak to us if that's what we
 
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to do or I don't know that might
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
become many hours I um I think or at
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
least right to us right I think it's
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
essential that the people have a right
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
to come here and be heard and discuss um
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
what they experienced people experienc
 
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
different things um and I think it's
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
important as Representatives that we
 
00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
hear all sides of the issue um so that
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
we can get a better understanding um of
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
affected

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
Tilly thank you okay so my question in
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
regards with this kind of um report that
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
is you said is due in June yes so this
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
is this is coming from you're saying the
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
executive branch it is coming from
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security emergency management
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
so from the Department of Safety
 
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.630 align:start position:0%
so from the Department of Safety
executive

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
branch okay so the feds or the state the
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
state okay
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
um so this is because I when I read your
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
email I guess I thought it was coming on
 
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
on the federal side not on the state
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
side so this is going to be exactly
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
specific to New Hampshire it is 100%
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire certainly Federal
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
guidance and federal inputs are part of
 
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
that um but it is from a New Hampshire
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
perspective um on the New Hampshire
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
specific response Okay so if um we're
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
going to ask for some some information
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest things that um I
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
would like is to is to literally have um
 
00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
kind of spelled out you know all the way
 
00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:42.519 align:start position:0%
down from the dime to the nickel to the
 
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
penny um for the money that has um come
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
in and run through whether it be uh you
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
know through cares through all of that
 
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:54.519 align:start position:0%
um um through the executive Council
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
federal state whatever I'd love all of
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
that Ian is that something that you guys
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
will be working on um because that's one
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
thing that I could give you guys in
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
advance that we would like to have I
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
know thank you very much for that
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
question um that's a tremendous
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
undertaking as you can as I'm sure you
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
appreciate um and so certainly I will
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
bring that back for all of the state
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
agencies because as you know money came
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
in from every corner um and money came
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
into each of the state agencies in
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
different ways money came directly
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
certainly our we certainly know about
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
the Gopher um that has been managing
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
that set of arpa money um and I can't my
 
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
brain is freezing for me of what uh arpa
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
stands for but it that is a huge pile of
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
that money and so I think to the degree
 
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:44.919 align:start position:0%
to which we can provide that information
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
you know um we certainly have anything
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
that was after the uh em the state
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
emergency certainly went through
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
governor and Council so there is all
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
public record it came in through fiscal
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee you know during the actual
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
State emergency um th there was
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
information provided to um those
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
entities but there were some
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
expediencies because of when we were in
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
the actual emergency in in the 2020
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
times but uh my short answer to your
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
question is that will take um effort
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
across all of the state agencies to
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
produce yeah I'm really only interested
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
in for because you're representing here
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
from DHHS I'm only I'm only interested
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
in your bucket like gopher and all of
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
that I know how to go about that I'm
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
really only interested in specifically
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
when it came to you guys sure so we
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
certainly have all that information
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
that's available um we would probably
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
need to know more from the committee in
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
the way in which to give that
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
information because it's so dense that I
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's actually fair to you
 
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
for me to just drop off like giant
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
stacks of paper so that's I think we
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
look forward to understanding what it is
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
you want how we can present it to you so
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
that it's actually read able and
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
understandable because it's it's STS
 
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.789 align:start position:0%
understandable because it's it's STS
thank

00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
you yeah and I think from a committee
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
sto it's something that we'll have to
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
discuss amongst ourselves um so that
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
there is Direction because if not um
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
like you said it could be we could be
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
all over the place so um and thank you
 
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
again I appreciate it um so
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
representative beler did you have
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
something I I was just you're good thank
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
you I was just going to mention on on
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
that I I think one of the things we'll
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
probably perhaps look for at some point
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
would be for um the persons who actually
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
have the expertise with the the
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
financial side of that at the HHS to
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
come here
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
with you know that data available to us
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
to to be able to help walk us through
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
some of that that would probably be
 
00:30:45.919 --> 00:30:51.070 align:start position:0%
some of that that would probably be
extremely

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
helpful representative
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
po so on topic like how we should
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
prioritize our work uh uh I I would
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't think we should just go in
 
00:31:08.519 --> 00:31:10.070 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't think we should just go in
chronological

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
chronological
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
order um I I like the idea about
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
topics um if anything I would go in
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
reverse chronological order because yeah
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's very important to see what
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
mistakes we did in 2020 with ventilation
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
or with masks but uh I would rather
 
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.070 align:start position:0%
or with masks but uh I would rather
concentrate

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
concentrate
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
on Co response is still ongoing like uh
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
state is still uh and and there are some
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
questions like I don't know about V REM
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
s that is being used to treat it like is
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
it the best and safest treatment or not
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
or uh state is spending resources on
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
promotion of covid vaccine and we are
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
seeing that despite this promotion
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine is highly
 
00:32:09.149 --> 00:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
unpopular so as a committee it would be
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
nice to see if it's actually like safe
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
and effective and maybe we need to
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
promote it better or maybe it's if it's
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
actually not an effective like because
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
it's we're currently state is currently
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
like heavily involved with with it so I
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
think like studying something
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
that we as a state reps can act right
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
now is more important than just getting
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
202 um represent PA I think that having
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh director buckton in here from
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
Homeland uh security um he could
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
technically walk us through the
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
beginning and to what's going on now um
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
he could kind of give us an overview um
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm not positive that he could do
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
that but I'm going to uh surmise that he
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
could probably give us an overview on
 
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
how you know a step by step on what's
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
gone on in the state from 2020 to now um
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
I also think that once we hear from him
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
I think you know as we go through
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
chronologically through topics you know
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
and bring in the
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities and talk about our state
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
parks we can learn about a little bit
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
about how that affected people and
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
how how that affected everything through
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
today so we don't have to um even though
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it somewhat
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
chronologically we just have to figure
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
out I think the big thing is is to start
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
with Homeland Security because
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
everything was directed through them so
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
that we have a better idea of uh as we
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
trickle down um because I mean had a
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
good point you know I never even gave it
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
a thought that you had to think of
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
guidance about driving in a plow truck
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
right I mean something that simple um I
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
never would have thought of um and for
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
me I was here at 4:00 a.m. on our last
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
session day I believe as representative
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
groer and leus were here also
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
um and how it affected the legislature
 
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
was we were hugely impacted um by the co
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
response um so I think there's a lot of
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
areas to take in so I think starting
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
with him and I can contact him to see
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
when he is
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
available um but I think that will help
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
give us a bird's eye overview of
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
everything and and you can ask him how
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
things are working today too because
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's like it's one subject but we
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
got to start at the beginning and then
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
we can go on to another topic I'm open
 
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.109 align:start position:0%
we can go on to another topic I'm open
represent

00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
beler thank you and it really just just
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
helped click for me um the chronological
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
side of this because I think it's going
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
to be incredibly important that as far
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
as any sort of final product and what
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at producing here we're
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
going to have to produce a timeline and
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
what happened when um so I think there's
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
definitely going to have to be a
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
chronological component to this I I also
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
like maybe sometimes breaking things aut
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
topically but I do understand the
 
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.790 align:start position:0%
topically but I do understand the
chronological

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
chronological
 
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.710 align:start position:0%
chronological
side

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
leus yeah I was thinking that perhaps we
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
could be topical and chronological at
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
the same time in that as a topic came
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
into important you know as a topic
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
cropped up then we explore that topic
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
and within that topic the chronology
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
from the beginning to now and then the
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
next thing that that was taken taken on
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
by you know that showed up do the same
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
thing and that gives us a sort of
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
logical procedure but at the same time
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
well it makes it logical in multiple
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
ways so it makes it easier to
 
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
organize um representative grto so while
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
representative luus was talking it me it
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
it came to mind
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
that I think starting with him with
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security is appropriate because
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
I do believe that what's going to happen
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
is it wasn't like boom everybody this
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
happened and everybody did the same
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
thing I think that there
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
are um
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
each um let's just call it each area of
 
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility regardless of what it is
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's DPW whether it was you know
 
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
Parks and Recreation they all man they
 
00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.670 align:start position:0%
Parks and Recreation they all man they
all

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.710 align:start position:0%
all
operated

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
operated
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
independently right they all had their
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
own timelines because I don't think that
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
it was all you know everybody walking
 
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
linearly down this path because
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
everybody had different aspects and
 
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
different things to handle so that
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
starting with Homeland Security might
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
give us the topics that we need to
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
investigate because that way does that
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
make sense I agree wholeheartedly with
 
00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.349 align:start position:0%
make sense I agree wholeheartedly with
that

00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts so is there um any more
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
discussion on how we want to proceed as
 
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.230 align:start position:0%
discussion on how we want to proceed as
a

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee representative Bela then
 
00:37:52.319 --> 00:37:53.390 align:start position:0%
committee representative Bela then
representative

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
leus thank you I was just going to ask
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
do we have any
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
um procedures in place for if we're
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to have absences that we have um
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
the possibility to substitute anyone or
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
anything like that just to make sure we
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
have a quorum week to week uh thank you
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
for that question but uh because we are
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
not voting on anything and we are a
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
special committee we do not need a
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
quorum and there are no substitutes
 
00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.950 align:start position:0%
quorum and there are no substitutes
represent

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
leus oh I just wondered if we have any
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
um plans
 
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
besides our final report of somehow
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
getting out even if it's just posting a
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
link to each
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
week's um Facebook you
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
know no I didn't mean Facebook YouTube
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
recordings right but as so that as we're
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
learning the public can be learning uh
 
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
these meetings are being recorded So
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
they are being uh live streamed as as
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're meeting today and then there'll be
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
archived so anybody can go on and see
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
that and I do understand what you're
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
talking about instead of doing a final
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
report all at the end I think that um we
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
should Reserve that as we delve in just
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit further and uh see how the
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee wants to move forward with
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%

um any other suggestions from the
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
committee on what you how you think we
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
should be moving up represent like us
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
joged your memory well that was the
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
right question to ask um I was wondering
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
if we were going to have like a
 
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.990 align:start position:0%
if we were going to have like a
committee

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
maybe a Google doc or something that as
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
we hear about that that we could have
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
um what topic or what thing we'd like to
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
have and what people to contact somebody
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
may have a a topic but not know who to
 
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
contact but other people may say oh this
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
person this person this person or what
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
questions we may want you know know
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
somebody else may say oh that's cool I
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
want to know this or this and if we all
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
put it together it might help us
 
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
organize um who we want to invite what
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
we want to ask Etc I don't know um I
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
think I'd be cautious about doing that
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
because these are public
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
hearings um and we have to make sure
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
that we uh stay in uh compliance of the
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
91a um so I think I'd be cautious
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
about moving forward in that okay thank
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
you represent Belcher thank you just a a
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
newbie question that came to mind is um
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
as far as establishing a permanent
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
record of the committee if we receive
 
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
testimony written anything it just comes
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
down and and where does that get stored
 
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
and how would the public gain access to
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
time

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead I can help um so I know that if
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
you wanted to have any information about
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
about a bill let's say even if it was
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
not this year in the past the clerk the
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
clerk's office has all the files that
 
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
contain information on the bill
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
including the subcommittee reports and
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
all of the voting and all the testimony
 
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
that was filed for that bill I would
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
imagine that the special commissions
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me the special commissions are
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
under the same ruling so we we could
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.030 align:start position:0%
 
done

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I I would I would agree
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
with that because as clerks and I
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
believe you're a clerk also that
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
everything does get filed by Bill so and
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
is the public can come in and ask for
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
it yes representative Le well just as a
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
followup of that if if our document
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
our planning asking questions whatever
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
was public as far as reading
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
but not as far as input you know like if
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
we could does that work or not work I
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
believe that's something that I'm not
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
sure uh can you repeat that uh for our
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
researcher okay the question was if
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
we I'm just trying to figure out a way
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
to get input and ideas as much as
 
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
possible and so that's why I was looking
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
at the Google Doc if it was a public
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
document but not everybody as as far as
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
reading it but not everybody could input
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
in it only the committee could would
 
00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
that then be okay and not be a 91a viol
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to the whole point
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
of this was to get information to the
 
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
public so I just want to make sure that
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
happens as much as possible but I also
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
want us to be able to
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
brainstorm in between each week so we
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
can plan who's coming and what we want
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
to ask them so I just trying to figure
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.470 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
you good yeah let me just real quick so
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
we already have access as you know like
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
through our legislative email to be able
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
to have a working document right so we
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
already have that uh capability
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
but then that could violate the 91a
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
piece right so that that would be an
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
issue so there is you know the I don't
 
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
know if we have that capability there's
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
a capability where literally a working
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
document can be viewed publicly and you
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
can actually see changes live and nobody
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
has access to going into that I just
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if that would be the best way
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
to to to to work on that because when
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're you know when you're in a draft
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
you're typing and you you know what I'm
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
saying and then someone grabs that and
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
says oh my gosh well this is what you
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
know what I'm saying so that it's hard
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
during committees we have work sessions
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
that are public and and then people can
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
all come together and sometimes that is
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
through peac mail um I love the idea I
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
just don't know how we could best do it
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
I I think um because there is no special
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
place that I'm aware of that it is
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
really not feasible uh to do that I
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
um go ahead and represent C so I think
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
that having shared commissions and being
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
being in your position it's very
 
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
difficult but I think one of the things
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
that's very important is that when we
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
end this meeting we understand that the
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
date and the time of the next meeting
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
will be 9:00 a.m. on February 23rd so we
 
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.079 align:start position:0%
know we're meeting again at that time
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to have invited the Homeland
 
00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.470 align:start position:0%
we're going to have invited the Homeland
securities

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
securities
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
um director M Mr buckton to come and
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
speak before us and then what I would
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
recommend Madame chair is that you have
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
an agenda right that we are opening the
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
meeting if you want to do the pledge you
 
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
put that on there and all that becomes
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
part of the public record so that this
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
all operates on a public record and I
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you can speak to to the speaker's
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
office about how they want to do that
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
because different commissions do it
 
00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:28.030 align:start position:0%
because different commissions do it
different

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
ways um and I really appreciate your
 
00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
bringing that up and I think that's a
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
great idea um so thank you so much
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
um uh like I said this is uh my first
 
00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.230 align:start position:0%
um uh like I said this is uh my first
time

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
and because it's such a broad topic I
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
just really and I called it an
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting because I just
 
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:53.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to discuss how we were going to
 
00:48:56.109 --> 00:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
proceed so
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh anybody else have anything that
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh they think we need to discuss further
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
or should
 
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh um make I'll make a motion to adjourn
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
for today and see everybody on the 23rd
 
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.069 align:start position:0%

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
having director buckon here
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you I I don't know if we have
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
to make a motion
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
to to end our meetings I'm not sure
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
because we don't do that in regular
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
committees yeah we don't do exactly
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
but that's okay that's right okay um
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so just you just gabble it we got
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
to get you a gab I'm good uh but um does
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
that sound like a plan for everyone
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
February 23rd at 9:00 a.m. uh director
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
buckton um we'll try and get him to be
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
here and I think um think I think he'll
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
have a lot to say and give us a lot to
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
think about um so that we can uh make
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
informative decisions moving forward on
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
how we want to proceed
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
next um if represent blus and in the
 
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
meantime we can all be thinking of
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions and talking to other people to
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
see if they have questions absolutely
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage everyone to be
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
talking to uh the people in their
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and their school
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
districts and their citizens I mean uh
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
to see if there's anything pertinent
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
that they'd like to know from the
 
00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
director so I think that would be
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
important um if everyone is all set uh
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
we will end this meeting and it is uh
 
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
1:8 I believe will
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
coming
